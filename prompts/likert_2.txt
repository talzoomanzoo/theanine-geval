[Task Description]
You will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.
You task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.
Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

[Criterion]
Helpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing {speaker}, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.

For your information:
A score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.
A score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.

[Evaluation Steps]
1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. 
2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. 
3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.
4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`
