[Task Description]
You will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.
You task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.
Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

[Criterion]
Helpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing {speaker}, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.

For your information:
A score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).
A score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.

[Evaluation Steps]
1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.
2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.
3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.
