It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that.

    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are consistent with the past memories as Speaker A has mentioned planning a snorkeling trip and offering to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming. Speaker B is interested in learning both activities, making either response viable without contradictions. Neither of the responses contradicts with Speaker B's fear of cruising due to their inability to swim because they suggest learning and practicing swimming beforehand, potentially alleviating this fear.\n\nChoice: tie"
