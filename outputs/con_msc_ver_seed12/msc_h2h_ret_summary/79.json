I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. \nSpeaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm a bit hesitant to befriend them. I'll see how the sheeting works first. By the way, how is Bandicoot adjusting to being at the zoo with you?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: I never thought about befriending them like that. I'll keep that in mind for the future. Thanks for the tip! Good luck with Bandicoot at work.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: In the past memories, it's stated that Speaker B works as a zookeeper and takes the raccoon Bandicoot to work at the Raccoon Cafe, not the zoo. Therefore, Response 1 is inconsistent with the past memories because it erroneously suggests that Bandicoot is adjusting to being at the zoo. On the other hand, Response 2 does not contain any such inconsistency and aligns with the information about Speaker B's situation with Bandicoot and their work environment. \n\nChoice: 2"
