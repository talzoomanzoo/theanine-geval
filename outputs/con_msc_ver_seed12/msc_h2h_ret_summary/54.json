It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I still have one more history exam coming up before the break. Hopefully, I can improve my grade on that one. How about you, any big plans for the break?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: I have a couple more exams left, including one for gym class. I'm feeling pretty confident about that one. How about you? Are you feeling prepared for your upcoming exams?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response contradicts the past memories greatly, but Response 1 mentions another history exam which is unnecessary given Speaker A has already received a B grade, indicating that the exams or evaluations for the term should be concluding. Response 2 is consistent because it highlights Speaker A's strong performance in gym class and an expectation of more exams, without implying mismatched timing for class assessments.\n\nChoice: 2"
