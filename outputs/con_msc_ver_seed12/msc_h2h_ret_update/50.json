Speaker B expressing contentment with sticking to cruises is consistent with their known interests. Response 2, while not directly contradictory, implies a newfound interest in possibly trying hiking, which is somewhat inconsistent with Speaker B's established preference for cruises and avoidance of the outdoors.\n\nChoice: 1"
