Classmate B is supportive of Classmate A's ventures, whether it be starting a business or pursuing singing. Response 1 is consistent with the current conversation about carpentry, but it is quite neutral and does not reference any past memories. Response 2, while still focused on carpentry, extends an offer of support, which is consistent with Classmate B's past behavior of encouraging and supporting Classmate A's pursuits. Therefore, Response 2 aligns more closely with the established pattern of behavior, showing consistency in the supportive dynamic between both classmates.\n\nChoice: 2"
