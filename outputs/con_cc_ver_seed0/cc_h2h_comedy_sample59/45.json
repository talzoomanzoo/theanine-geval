    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nCo-worker A witnessed a fight and intervened to separate the two women.\nCo-worker B commended Co-worker A for their bravery and willingness to help.\nCo-worker A spoke with the police about the incident and the women involved were thankful.\nCo-worker B mentioned helping a customer resolve an issue last week, showing a willingness to assist others.\nCo-worker A was in a car accident and lost their hands and feet.\nCo-worker A is alive but will need time to adjust to their new way of life.\nCo-worker B is supportive and willing to help in any way.\nCo-worker A will need all the help they can get during their recovery.\nCo-worker A is trying to stay positive and focus on their recovery, despite it being a daunting task.\nCo-worker A is remembered for being brave and strong in past situations.\nCo-worker A has a positive attitude and focuses on making people happy despite facing challenges like losing their hands and feet.\nCo-worker B admires Co-worker A's resilience and positivity.\nCo-worker A believes in surrounding oneself with positive energy and uplifting people.\nCo-worker A intervened to help two women who were fighting, showing bravery and a desire to make a positive impact.\nCo-worker A is humble and tries to make the world a better place by helping others.\nCo-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\nCo-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\nCo-worker A is described as positive and able to stay optimistic even in challenging situations, like the accident where they lost their hands and feet.\nCo-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's positivity and friendship.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it.\nCo-workers B: That's not the same thing, Co-workers A. Stealing someone and keeping them against their will is illegal and immoral. You need to let go of this obsession and move on. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers A: I know you're right, Co-worker B. I'll try to let go of this obsession and respect her choices. Thanks for being honest with me.\nRESPONSE 2\nCo-workers A:  Co-workers A, I understand that you have strong feelings for the bride, but kidnapping her is not the answer. It's important to respect her choices and feelings. Remember how we always support each other and strive to make the world a better place through kindness and support? Let's find a healthier way to deal with your emotions and move forward in a positive direction.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses aim to guide Co-worker A towards a healthier perspective, but Response 2 directly references the past memory of supporting each other and striving to make the world a better place through kindness and support. This recalls Co-worker B's supportive nature and Co-worker A's inclination to help others and maintain positivity, which are key past memories. Response 2 integrates these past elements into the current situation, enhancing memorability.\n\nChoice: 2"
