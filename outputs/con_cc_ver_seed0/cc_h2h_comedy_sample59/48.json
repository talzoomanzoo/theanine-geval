    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 2 directly recalls past memories where Co-worker A had a fall, felt dizzy, and considered seeing a doctor. It reflects Co-worker B's supportive nature and encouragement for Co-worker A to prioritize health, which aligns with the past memories of Co-worker B being supportive and recommending a doctor. This specific mention of the fall and concern for health shows a stronger connection to the past events compared to Response 1, which doesn't reference any past memories.\n\nChoice: 2"
