    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 2 acknowledges the past memory of Neighbor A's mother getting upset about the shirt tag and expands on it by discussing the nature of parent-child disagreements, showing empathy by sharing a common experience. This response also ties back to past memories of the two neighbors wanting to strengthen their friendship by emphasizing the importance of talking about personal experiences and building memorable moments together, capturing the essence of their evolving relationship. Response 1 is less reflective of past memories and does not establish or build upon the theme of friendship and shared experiences to the same degree.\n\nChoice: 2"
