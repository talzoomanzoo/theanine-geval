But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\nMentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here.\nMentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people.\nMentee: Those are good suggestions, Mentor. I'll consider joining a club or volunteering. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nMentor: That's a great start, Mentee. Remember, it takes time to build new friendships, so be patient with yourself. You never know what connections you might make along the way.\nRESPONSE 2\nMentor: I'm glad you're open to trying new things, Mentee. Remember, it's okay to feel a bit out of place in the beginning. Just keep putting yourself out there, and I'm sure you'll start to feel more at home in the city soon.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are supportive and acknowledge the Mentee's willingness to engage in new activities, but Response 1 emphasizes the concept of \"building new friendships,\" which closely aligns with the Mentor's previous support of the Mentee's decision to take the city job. The Mentor reflects on past guidance about taking new opportunities and the patience required, which evokes the mentor's previous encouragement in decision-making. While Response 2 touches on the Mentee feeling out of place, it does not tie back to memories as strongly as Response 1.\n\nChoice: 1"
