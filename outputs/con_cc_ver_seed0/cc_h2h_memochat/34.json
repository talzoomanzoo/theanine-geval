    "prediction": "Explanation: \nThe task is to determine which response is more consistent with past memories. Response 1 expresses appreciation for Classmates B's support, which aligns with the memory of Classmates B being supportive and encouraging Classmates A to try new things. There's no new or contradictory information in this response. Response 2, however, entails Classmates A encouraging Classmates B to keep following their passions and dreams, which implies classmate B is pursuing a journey that aligns with Classmates A's, whereas the memories indicate that Classmates B has been working and traveling since high school. Although Response 2 doesn't explicitly contradict the past, it introduces a potential inconsistency about who is taking such a journey, which has not been characterized for Classmates B.\n\nChoice: 1"
