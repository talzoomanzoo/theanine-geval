You know, I remember when we watched the sunrise together a few weeks ago. That was really special.\nParent: It was. I love being able to appreciate the beauty of nature.

Your support means a lot to me, and I appreciate your kind words.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 2 has higher memorability as it references past memories of creating a safe and stable environment for the child, which is one of the parent's goals mentioned in the memories. It also touches on the theme of creating happy memories together, paralleling the past traditions of watching the sunrise. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of the child's support, which ties back to the child's previous supportive gestures in difficult situations. Response 1, while acknowledging the child's appreciation, does not reflect specific past memories as comprehensively as Response 2.\n\nChoice: 2"
