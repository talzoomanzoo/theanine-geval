    "prediction": "I'm sorry, but the response does not provide an explanation or choice based on the given criterion, \"Consistency.\" Here is the appropriate output:\n\nExplanation: \nResponse 1 is consistent with the past memories as it emphasizes listening to one's body and self-care, which aligns with the advice Classmates B has given in the past. It also acknowledges Classmates A's determination, which is a central trait of Classmates A in the past memories. Response 2, on the other hand, contains a contradiction because Classmates B is speaking from Classmates A's perspective, which does not align with the current conversation context where Classmates B is the one responding and offering support to Classmates A.\n\nChoice: 1"
