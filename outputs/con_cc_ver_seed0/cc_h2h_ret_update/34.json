    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are consistent with past memories, as they both align with Classmates B's supportive nature and Classmates A's gratitude for B's encouragement. Classmates A acknowledges Classmates B's influence and support in both responses without contradicting any past memories.\n\nHowever, Response 2 includes specific details about how Classmates B's encouragement and advice helped push Classmates A into pursuing their passions, which directly ties back to the past memory of B giving advice that paid off and encouraging A to step out of their comfort zone. Additionally, it references the idea of making a positive impact, which aligns with Classmates B's emphasis on positively impacting others while living a fulfilling life.\n\nResponse 1, while consistent, lacks this specific connection to the past interactions and themes discussed between A and B.\n\nChoice: 2"
