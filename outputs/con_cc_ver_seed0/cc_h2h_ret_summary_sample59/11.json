    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 1 is better in terms of Memorability because it touches on the broader aspect of forming a new support system, which is linked to the Past Memory where the Mentor has supported the Mentee in their various endeavors, including their decision to take a job in the city. Moreover, the mention of \"transition\" hints at the Mentee's previous life changes such as moving to the city, making the response more reflective of the Mentee's journey and the Mentor's consistent guidance through pivotal moments.\n\nChoice: 1"
