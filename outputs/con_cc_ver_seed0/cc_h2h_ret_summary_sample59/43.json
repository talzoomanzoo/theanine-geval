I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers A: I understand what you're saying, Co-worker B, but I can't help how I feel. Love can make us do crazy things sometimes.\nRESPONSE 2\nCo-workers A: I guess you're right, Co-workers B. I was just caught up in my emotions. I'll try to find a healthier way to deal with this. Thanks for talking some sense into me.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses do not directly reference past memories. However, Response 2 slightly mirrors the theme of self-reflection and adjusting behavior exhibited by Co-worker A's positivity and resilience in overcoming challenges like their accident. Co-worker A is receptive to Co-worker B's advice, similar to how they valued B's support and reassurances in the past. Response 1, while acknowledging Co-worker B's perspective, doesn't fully align with Co-worker A's established character of focusing on positivity and making people happy.\n\nChoice: 2"
