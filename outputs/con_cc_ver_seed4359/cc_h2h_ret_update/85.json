Response 2 is consistent with past memories because Classmate A acknowledges the importance of working hard, staying focused on their goals, and asking for help when needed, which aligns with the advice and encouragement previously given by Classmate B and A's beliefs. Response 2 also appreciates Classmate B's support, consistent with their positive rapport. Both responses are consistent with past interactions, but Response 2 aligns more closely with previously expressed values and conversations about hard work and perseverance.\n\nChoice: 2"
