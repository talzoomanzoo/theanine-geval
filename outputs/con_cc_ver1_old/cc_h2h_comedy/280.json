Co-worker A has expressed interest in making a positive difference and has shown concern for others, aligning with prioritizing differences over seeking power.

However, Response 2 contradicts past memories in that Co-worker B values fulfillment and relationships over making money and power, while Co-worker A values making money and sees it as a means to fulfillment.\n\nChoice: 1"
