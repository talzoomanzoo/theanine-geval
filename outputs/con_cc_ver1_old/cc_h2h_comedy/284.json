    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 1 stays consistent with the conversation about hot sauce and does not introduce any contradictory information. Response 2, on the other hand, suggests that the teacher enjoys planning activities with their grandkids for retirement, which contradicts the past memory indicating that it is actually the student who is planning for retirement and spending time with their grandkids. There is also an implication that the teacher relates the hot sauce experience to their own experience with languages and retirement plans, which is not consistent with the past memories. Therefore, Response 1 is a better choice based on consistency with past memories. \n\nChoice: 1"
