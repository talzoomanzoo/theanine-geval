    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 1 is consistent with the past memories as it acknowledges the mentor's support and advice, reflecting the nature of the mentor-mentee relationship. It emphasizes a proactive approach in exploring new opportunities while maintaining connections with old friends, which aligns with the mentor's advice in the conversation. Response 2, while containing similar content, introduces additional motivational language and reference to past decisions that were not part of the current conversation or relevant memories. This doesn't necessarily contradict past memories but adds unnecessary information not directly related to the current context.\n\nChoice: 1"
