    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 1 offers support and aligns with Co-worker A's known supportive attitude without introducing any contradictory information. Response 2, although supportive, incorrectly attributes a question to Co-worker B that did not occur in the current conversation. Co-worker B didn't ask about Co-worker A's workload, only mentioned their own. This is inconsistent with the conversation flow and contradicts the interaction outlined.\n\nChoice: 1"
