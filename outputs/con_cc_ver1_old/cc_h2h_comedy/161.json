    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 2 is more consistent with past memories as it aligns with the Mentor's emphasis on living in the moment and paying attention to small details. It reinforces the idea of savoring experiences, which has been a key part of the Mentee's journey. It also provides encouragement, which is consistent with the Mentor's supportive nature. Response 1, while practical, does not reference any of the past themes of living in the moment, savoring life, or personal growth, thus lacking the depth and alignment seen in Response 2.\n\nChoice: 2"
