    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 1 focuses on a new detail that does not relate to the past memories; it inquires about how Classmates A met their girlfriend at the party, which is consistent with the shared memories but does not expand on them. Response 2, on the other hand, refers to multiple past memories - the frustration with the belt, the improvement through channeling energy into studies, the 'weirdness' that adds excitement, and the new relationship all fitting together. Both responses are accurate regarding past memories, but Response 2 integrates and reflects multiple past details more effectively than Response 1, maintaining a higher level of consistency and connection to the shared history.\n\nChoice: 2"
