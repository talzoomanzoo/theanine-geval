    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 2 is more consistent because it references the past memory of the husband's fifth-grade presentation, where the wife reassured him and encouraged him to embrace his unique voice. This connection is relevant as it mirrors the current situation where the husband needs reassurance and a break to find inspiration. Response 1 does not contradict past memories, but it lacks the connection to the husband's past experience, making it less consistent with their shared history.\n\nChoice: 2"
