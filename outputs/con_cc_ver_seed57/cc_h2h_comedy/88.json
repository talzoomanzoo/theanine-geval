That's not how it works. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nClassmates A: I'm really regretting it now.

Remember, hard work and dedication will always pay off in the long run. If you need any help or support, I'm here for you.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nNeither response contains information that directly contradicts the past memories. Both responses involve Classmates A acknowledging their mistake and referencing the idea of asking for help or support, which is consistent with the earlier memories of Classmate B offering support to Classmate A. Response 2 expands on this by emphasizing honesty, hard work, and dedication, which aligns with Classmate A's attitude towards achieving goals in basketball and their job. However, Classmates A's speaking part in Response 2 is inconsistent because it is Classmate A admitting guilt and owning up to the mistake, not offering advice. Therefore, Response 1 is more appropriate since it fits the context of the conversation better.\n\nChoice: 1"
