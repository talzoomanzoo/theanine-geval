Additionally, Classmates A frequently seeks to challenge themselves and improve their skills, aligning with the themes of both responses.

Both responses are aligned with the past memories, but Response 2 explicitly ties the conversation back to a specific memory, providing a stronger link to the past.\n\nChoice: 2"
