It's important to take responsibility for our actions and try to rectify the situation. Have you considered seeking professional advice or assistance to navigate through this issue?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nBoth responses are consistent with the past memories and the current situation, as neither response contains information that contradicts the past memories. However, neither response aligns with the fact that Classmate B is not the one caught cheating, as the original statement is directly from Classmate A. Both responses address A's situation and suggest seeking professional advice. The discrepancy lies in the fact that the responses refer to Classmate B as if they are the one having the issue. If we correct for the speaker error, response 2 stays more within character and in tone with the past conversation patterns, as it emphasizes taking responsibility and resolving issues, which aligns with Classmate B's supportive nature.\n\nChoice: 2"
