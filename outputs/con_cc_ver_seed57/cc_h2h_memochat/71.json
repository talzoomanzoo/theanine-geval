    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses align with the past memories, but response 1 is more consistent with the recent experiences that highlight A's attention to B's stress and A's offer of support and stress relief, including massages and being there for B during stressful times. Response 2, while also related to past memories, leans more into older doubts and the past issue of trust which has already been somewhat resolved. Since B has been stressed and A has responded to this in memory, the first response is more directly relevant and script-consistent.\n\nChoice: 1"
