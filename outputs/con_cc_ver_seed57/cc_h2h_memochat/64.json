    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 is consistent with past memories as Classmate A emphasizes the importance of giving 110% effort and handling mistakes gracefully, aligning with their belief in doing their best at everything. Response 2, however, contains an inconsistency: it mistakenly refers to Classmate A thanking Classmate A instead of addressing Classmate B. This contradiction in character reference impacts the consistency of the response.\n\nChoice: 1"
