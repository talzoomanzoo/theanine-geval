    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither of the responses directly addresses the topic of cheating on taxes, as the past memories do not contain information about this situation. However, both responses offer support, which aligns with Classmate B's supportive nature seen in past memories. Since neither response contradicts the past memories regarding tax issues, we look at the consistency based on their supportive behavior. Response 2 emphasizes being in it together and offering help, which directly correlates with the reassurance Classmate B provided in past memories. Response 1 suggests seeking professional advice, which is neutral and does not contradict previous memories.\n\nChoice: tie"
