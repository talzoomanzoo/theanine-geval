    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are consistent with the past memory that Speaker B played intramural soccer in college. However, Response 2 is inconsistent, as it incorrectly suggests that Speaker A was a goalkeeper in college, which contradicts the information that Speaker A plays as a striker. On the other hand, Response 1 does not introduce any contradictions and directly responds to the question about missing playing soccer.\n\nChoice: 1"
