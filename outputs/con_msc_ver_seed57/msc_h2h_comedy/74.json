There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you?\nSpeaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions?\nSpeaker B: Unfortunately I mainly play games similar to RE. I don't know why I like them so much. I remember when I was little my brother play Doom and it gave me nightmares for a week. What genre of games you like?\nSpeaker A: I like all kinds of games. I like party, fighting, RPGs, shooters, action, adventure, and puzzle games. I enjoy playing Jurassic Park: World but I'd like to find another game to play. The storm means I'll be inside for a bit, so I think I'll curl up with some pizza and just zone out. Do you like to do anything else besides game when it's rainy?\nSpeaker B: Well, I might help around the house with cleaning or laundry, but not that much. Mostly gaming. If I feel I sat too long, I'll switch to Nintendo Switch's Ring Fit Adventure to get my body moving a bit. Do yo know that game?\nSpeaker A: I've heard of it. I think I need to get some exercise, so that might be a good idea. I'd like to stay in shape as much as I can. I guess games are the best way to do that! That's a good suggestion. How about you? Do you only like games like RE? What other genres do you like? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I do enjoy a variety of genres, but horror games like Resident Evil are my favorite. I also like action-adventure games and RPGs. Do you have any favorite RPGs or action-adventure games you'd recommend?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B:  That's interesting! I've never been hunting before. It sounds like a unique experience. I'm glad you enjoy it. I usually stick to games like Resident Evil, but I'm open to trying new genres. Let's plan to play some games together next week Friday after work. How about we start with Resident Evil VIII and see how it goes?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
