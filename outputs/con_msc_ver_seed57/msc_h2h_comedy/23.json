Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Yes, I have thought about teaching as a potential career path. It seems like a stable and rewarding option.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B:  I haven't talked to my advisor yet, but I'm considering teaching as a career option. I've always enjoyed helping others, just like how you help your grandparents. Teaching computer science at a community college and getting involved with robotics sounds like a great plan. Maybe we can even collaborate on some projects in the future!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 is consistent with Speaker B's memory as it reflects their consideration of teaching as a potential career path. Speaker B is considering getting a master's degree and potentially becoming a college professor, so teaching aligns with their future plans. Response 2, on the other hand, refers to teaching computer science and getting involved with robotics, which are interests of Speaker A, not Speaker B. This makes Response 2 inconsistent with Speaker B's past memories.\n\nChoice: 1"
