Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\nSpeaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it.\nSpeaker A: Cool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot. What is your favorite part about camping?\nSpeaker B: I love being out in the wilderness and sleeping under the stars in the fresh air. It makes you realize how beautiful life is and how small we really are in comparison to the universe.\nSpeaker A: I miss doing that! I have done lots of picnics with my family but it's been a long time since I've slept in a tent! Looking forward to it again when the kids are older. Where was the last place you went?\nSpeaker B: We went up to an island in the middle of nowhere in Canada. There were lots of bears and huge moose!\nSpeaker A: Wow, that sounds like such an adventure! I love to visit Canada. I have seen moose but never a bear! That must have been scary!\nSpeaker B: Yes, it is quite scary. We could also hear the wolves howling at night, luckily we didn't come across them though. One thing to note about bears, is they just want to come and scrounge for our food, so we learned to safely pack it away and hang it up high in a tree. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: That must have been an unforgettable experience with all those wild animals around! Safety is always a top priority when camping.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A:  Thank you! I believe my scouting experience will definitely come in handy when volunteering at the church retreat. I've been involved in a lot of volunteer work through Boy Scouts, so I think I can contribute in a meaningful way. I'm excited to participate and help out in any way I can.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 is consistent with the past memory of Speaker B relating their wilderness camping experience and the safety measures they followed, so it doesn't contain any contradictions or introduce inconsistencies. Response 2, however, is inconsistent as it mistakenly presents Speaker A as someone who has been involved with Boy Scouts, which contradicts the past memory (it's Speaker B who is involved with Boy Scouts).\n\nChoice: 1"
