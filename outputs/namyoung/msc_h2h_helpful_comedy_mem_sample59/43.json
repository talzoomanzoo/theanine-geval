Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden?\nSpeaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends.\nSpeaker A: That sounds nice! So how is your job going?\nSpeaker B: Always interesting, that's for sure! I have been training to nurse on a new floor, so that'll give me a change of scenery.\nSpeaker A: Does that add a lot of extra work to your plate?\nSpeaker B: At the moment, yes. I'll be in Pediatrics, which has always been my passion. It's a completely different environment than the ER.\nSpeaker A: Oh wow! That is so exciting for you. Will you get to stay in pediatrics after the training is complete? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides relevant information about Speaker B's connection to Sweden, which includes personal ties to the country such as their parents living there. This gives context to Speaker B's desire to return to Sweden and adds depth to their mention of loving local beach spots and old friends, which is relevant to the dialogue. MEMORY 2 also mentions Speaker B's love of coffee shops, overlapping with Speaker A's interest, possibly providing additional context for the interaction. In contrast, MEMORY 1 contains some repetitive and unclear information such as Speaker A and Speaker B planning to travel together to Sweden, which is not mentioned in the dialogue context. Moreover, it does not connect with the current topic about Speaker B's new work environment in Pediatrics, while MEMORY 2, being more comprehensive, forms a basis on which the conversation can build.\n\nChoice: 2"
