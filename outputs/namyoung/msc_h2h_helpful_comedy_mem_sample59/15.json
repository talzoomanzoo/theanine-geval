    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A has known how to swim since the age of 5 and offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\nSpeaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming. \nSpeaker B does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies, which causes Speaker A to plan a snorkeling trip and sign up for several trips. As a result, Speaker A is planning a snorkeling trip and wants to travel to the Caribbean for their next trip.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nSpeaker A is a computer programmer who enjoys adventure and travel, particularly on cruises. They have a loving workplace culture and find swimming to be a relaxing activity. Speaker A also likes pizza and cube steak. They can be nervous at times but finds swimming and programming to be rewarding and relaxing activities.\n\nRelationship Description:\nSpeaker B is interested in learning programming from Speaker A and is willing to join them in swimming lessons. They share a love for punk music and pizzaburgers. Speaker B appreciates the welcoming environment at Speaker A's workplace and is open to trying new experiences like going on a cruise.\n\nEvent Description:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B plan to meet up next weekend and enjoy punk rock music and pizza burgers. They will also have programming lessons and swim time together. Speaker A is excited about their upcoming trip to the Caribbean and is looking forward to teaching Speaker B how to swim. Speaker B may overcome their fear of water to join Speaker A on a cruise in the future.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more helpful because it provides relevant context about Speaker B's interest in learning swimming and programming from Speaker A, a fact already mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It also aligns with Speaker A's excitement about an upcoming trip to the Caribbean, which directly relates to the current topic being discussed (\"I'm excited about going to the Caribbean. I've never been. Have you?\"). MEMORY 2 also includes pertinent information about the relationship between Speaker A and Speaker B and their shared interests, making it more appropriate for an effective response in the given context.\n\nChoice: 2"
