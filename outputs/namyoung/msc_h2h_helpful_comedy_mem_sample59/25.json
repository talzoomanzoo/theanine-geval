    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience. Speaker A offers to take Sparky for a walk to help out and spend time with the dog. Speaker A is considering getting a dog and already walks Speaker B's dog, Sparky. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nSpeaker B is a hardworking student ahead of college, working at a diner cooking hamburgers. They are interested in neuroscience, have a deaf dog named Sparky, and are planning to major in molecular biology. Speaker B is known for inventing a chili dog casserole and may take summer classes to get a head start on college.\n\nRelationship Description:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B share a close bond, discussing their love for dogs and food. Speaker A compliments Speaker B on being a great dog owner and offers to walk Sparky. They also plan to try Speaker B's famous hamburgers at the diner.\n\nEvent Description:\nEvents shared by Speaker A and Speaker B include discussing their dogs, sharing dinner choices, and talking about future plans. Speaker B invents a chili dog casserole and plans to clone a jersey cow. Speaker A recommends taking summer classes to get ahead in college.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more helpful because it contains relevant information about Speaker B's interest in neuroscience, their study plans, and the fact that they work at a diner cooking hamburgers. This context aligns with the current conversation about lab work, hamburgers, and food preferences more directly than MEMORY 1.\n\nChoice: 2"
