    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides context directly related to Speaker B's interest in nature walks and connects with the question asked by Speaker B, \"Where did you go on your walk?\" It indicates Speaker B is inspired by nature, which might align with their interest in learning about different walking locations. MEMORY 1, while mentioning nature and walking, provides unnecessary details about reading and exercise form that do not directly help respond to the question about the walk location.\n\nChoice: 2"
