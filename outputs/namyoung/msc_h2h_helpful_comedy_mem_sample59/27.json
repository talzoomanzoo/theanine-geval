    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal.\nSpeaker B: That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab! \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B, a high school student preparing for college, works at a diner at night. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner. Speaker A had cheesy ham and potato soup for dinner. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nSpeaker B is a hardworking student ahead of college, working at a diner cooking hamburgers. They are interested in neuroscience, have a deaf dog named Sparky, and are planning to major in molecular biology. Speaker B is known for inventing a chili dog casserole and may take summer classes to get a head start on college.\n\nRelationship Description:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B share a close bond, discussing their love for dogs and food. Speaker A compliments Speaker B on being a great dog owner and offers to walk Sparky. They also plan to try Speaker B's famous hamburgers at the diner.\n\nEvent Description:\nEvents shared by Speaker A and Speaker B include discussing their dogs, sharing dinner choices, and talking about future plans. Speaker B invents a chili dog casserole and plans to clone a jersey cow. Speaker A recommends taking summer classes to get ahead in college.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a more comprehensive and relevant context for the conversation. It highlights Speaker B's interests in neuroscience and molecular biology, which ties directly into the topic of cloning discussed in the dialogue. It also explains Speaker B's motivations, such as planning to take summer classes, which could affect their decision to keep working at the lab. These details can be useful for Speaker A to maintain a contextually relevant conversation about the cloning process and educational pursuits. MEMORY 1 lacks specific references to cloning or relevant academic interests that would be useful for Speaker A's response.\n\nChoice: 2"
