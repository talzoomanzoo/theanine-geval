    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\nSpeaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing? \nSpeaker B: He's doing well! He just finished theatre camp and he's fighting with my sister because he wants to dye his hair green hahaha.\nSpeaker A: Young people today really have different values than our generation had. Acting sounds like it would be personally rewarding. I also like the arts. I play guitar and piano. You mentioned that you have a poll. That sounds refreshing in the hot weather. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation, despite Speaker B turning 29 next week.\n2. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one; hence, Speaker A, a retired librarian, recommends the book \"Beautiful Ruins\" by Jess Walter for a beach visit.\n3. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break, wanting to go on a trip but has not started packing yet.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nSpeaker A is a retired individual with a quiet nature who enjoys nature. They have eight grandchildren and have recently dyed their hair turquoise, considering other colors like purple and blue. Speaker A's daughter is passionate about cosmetology and plans to start her own salon. Speaker A is interested in book recommendations for a beach visit.\n\nRelationship Description:\nThe relationship between Speaker A and Speaker B is friendly and casual, with discussions about hair dyeing, car purchases, and book recommendations. Speaker B is supportive of Speaker A's decisions and offers suggestions for hair color and car choices.\n\nEvent Description:\nEvents shared by Speaker A and Speaker B include discussions about hair dyeing, with Speaker A getting help from their grandkids, and details about Speaker A's daughter's passion for cosmetology. Speaker B also shares their preference for last-minute decisions and their new black car purchase. Additionally, book recommendations for a beach visit are exchanged between the two speakers.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: In the dialogue context, Speaker B is planning a trip to Costa Rica and Speaker A mentions their interest in historical fiction and the arts. The MEMORY should be relevant to the conversation, particularly focusing on aspects that offer help for responding to the topics discussed, such as travel, books, art, or related personal interests.\n\nMEMORY 1 provides details about past travel experiences and book recommendations, which align with the conversation about reading and visiting Costa Rica, making it more helpful for continuing the dialogue.\n\nMEMORY 2 contains broader personal information that is not directly relevant to the specific points discussed in the dialogue, such as hair dyeing and cosmetology, thereby offering less direct support for engaging with the topics at hand.\n\nChoice: 1"
