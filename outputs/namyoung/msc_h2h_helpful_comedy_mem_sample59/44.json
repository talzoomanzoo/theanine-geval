    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A is involved in horse breeding and taking care of horses, which has caused Speaker B to work in their own therapy practice for about six years. \nSpeaker B, a therapist and football fan supporting the Chiefs, mentions the ups and downs of the profession, and wants to live in the city and have a horse in the future.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description: Speaker A is a person who works at stables and breeds and takes care of horses. They host football parties and enjoy being around horses. Speaker A has 8 horses, 3 of which are for sale, and feeds them grass roughage with some grains, oats, and plenty of water. They are knowledgeable about the costs involved in owning horses, including feeding, housing, and medical fees. Speaker A is more of a Broncos fan and hasn't seen their parents in a while. Their dad is depressed and hardly ever smiles.\n\nRelationship Description: Speaker B is a therapist who loves football, is a Chiefs fan, and goes to games with their mom, who is a nurse. They suggest talking about the absence of Speaker A's mother leading to horse breeding. Speaker B is interested in having horses but cannot due to living in the city. They think owning a horse may represent an unmet need for intimacy and bonding. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years and cannot have relationships with people in practice.\n\nEvent Description: Speaker A came in from the stables, finished feeding horses, and thinks about owning a horse. Speaker B is eating pizza and still thinks owning a horse doesn't make sense unless leaving the city. They discuss the costs of owning horses, horse care, and the potential psychological implications of wanting a horse. Speaker A suggests meeting new people to find a partner, while Speaker B watches a lot of football and believes spending more time looking for a husband would be good. Speaker A has been married for four years.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 provides information about Speaker B being a therapist and some of their future aspirations, including wanting to have a horse and live in the city. This background can be directly relevant to the question of how Speaker B decided to become a therapist, as it provides context around Speaker B's professional life and personal aspirations. \n\nIn contrast, Memory 2 contains a lot of additional information about Speaker A, the relationship between Speaker A and B, various events, and psychological implications, which may not directly assist in answering how Speaker B decided to become a therapist. The excessive details may distract from formulating a direct and relevant response to the question.\n\nChoice: 1"
