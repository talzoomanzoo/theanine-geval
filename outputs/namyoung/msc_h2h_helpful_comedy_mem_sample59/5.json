    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue primarily revolves around traveling, specifically Speaker B's upcoming trip to Costa Rica, and the topic of books, particularly historical fiction which Speaker A enjoys. MEMORY 1 provides information about Speaker A recommending a book for a beach visit, which aligns well with Speaker B's travel plans and the current conversation flow. It also mentions Speaker A's background as a retired librarian, which adds credibility to their book recommendation. In contrast, MEMORY 2 contains detailed information about Speaker B's personal characteristics, interests, and their relationship dynamics, which appears tangential to the current dialogue focused on traveling and books. Thus, MEMORY 1 is more directly relevant and useful for continuing the conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
