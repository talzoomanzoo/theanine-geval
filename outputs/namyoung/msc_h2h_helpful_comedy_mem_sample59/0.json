It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break. They want to go on a trip but have not started packing yet. Speaker B recently got a new blue hair color and a new Easter dress. This changed to Speaker B's new car being black, which is their first new car after driving pre-owned cars before. This change caused Speaker B to receive a new car from their mom and plan to drive during spring break. Speaker A is worried about gas mileage and asks about the fuel efficiency of Speaker B's car.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nSpeaker A is a retired individual with a quiet nature who enjoys nature. They have eight grandchildren and have recently dyed their hair turquoise, considering other colors like purple and blue. Speaker A's daughter is passionate about cosmetology and plans to start her own salon. Speaker A is interested in book recommendations for a beach visit.\n\nRelationship Description:\nThe relationship between Speaker A and Speaker B is friendly and casual, with discussions about hair dyeing, car purchases, and book recommendations. Speaker B is supportive of Speaker A's decisions and offers suggestions for hair color and car choices.\n\nEvent Description:\nEvents shared by Speaker A and Speaker B include discussions about hair dyeing, with Speaker A getting help from their grandkids, and details about Speaker A's daughter's passion for cosmetology. Speaker B also shares their preference for last-minute decisions and their new black car purchase. Additionally, book recommendations for a beach visit are exchanged between the two speakers.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialog context specifically asks about whether Speaker B has purchased plane tickets yet. MEMORY 1 is more relevant to this context because it mentions travel plans and Speaker B planning to drive during spring break, which could be related to their decision about plane tickets. MEMORY 2 does not mention anything about travel or plane tickets, focusing instead on unrelated topics like hair dyeing, cars, and cosmetology.\n\nChoice: 1"
