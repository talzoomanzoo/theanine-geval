    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B's interest in becoming a therapist stemmed from their mom being a nurse and busy with work. This led Speaker B to discuss the profession's ups and downs, including the concern about the cost of owning horses and considering the psychological aspects of horse ownership in relation to Freudian theories.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description: Speaker B is a therapist who enjoys watching football and is a Chiefs fan. They have a close relationship with their mom and are considering spending more time looking for a husband. Speaker B has been in their own practice for about six years and values making a difference in people's lives.\n\nRelationship Description: Speaker A and Speaker B have a casual and friendly relationship. They discuss topics such as owning horses, football, relationships, and therapy practices. Speaker A offers advice and suggestions to Speaker B about various aspects of their life.\n\nEvent Description: Speaker B and Speaker A have conversations about owning horses, the cost and care involved, as well as the psychological aspects of owning a horse. They also discuss Speaker B's interest in finding a husband and their experiences in their therapy practice. Speaker A shares personal experiences and offers insights into relationships and meeting new people.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a more helpful context because it contains relevant information about Speaker B's professional experience as a therapist, including their enjoyment and dedication to making a difference in people's lives. This aligns directly with the conversation about therapy and could enhance Speaker A's understanding and trust in Speaker B's offer to see them for therapy. On the other hand, MEMORY 1 focuses more on background details and tangential topics like horse ownership and Freudian theories, which are less relevant to the immediate context of Speaker B offering therapy.\n\nChoice: 2"
