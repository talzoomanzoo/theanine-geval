But eventually, I found someone who was willing to listen and it made all the difference.\nChild: I'm glad you found someone to talk to. You know, I remember when we watched the sunrise together a few weeks ago. That was really special.\nParent: It was. I love being able to appreciate the beauty of nature.

The Parent and Child enjoy watching the sunrise together, finding it special and memorable.\n2.

Parent is grateful for Child's support and appreciates their presence in their life.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 focuses on the specific event of the parent and child watching the sunrise together, which is directly relevant to the last utterance in the dialogue where the parent mentions the value of appreciating nature and their own place in the suburbs facilitating this appreciation. Memory 2 includes additional context about the parent valuing self-sufficiency and the overall relationship dynamics, which, while relevant in general, is not as specifically tied to the immediate context of the discussion about watching the sunrise and appreciating nature from their suburban home. Therefore, Memory 1 is more helpful in providing a focused and relevant response.\n\nChoice: 1"
