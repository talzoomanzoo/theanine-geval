    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a more comprehensive and relevant context about the relationship between Co-workers A and B. It notes that Co-worker B is supportive and collaborative, which aligns well with responding to Co-worker B's current workload situation. This information can guide Co-worker A to respond in a supportive manner, acknowledging Co-worker B's helpful nature, or potentially offering assistance just as Co-worker B has done in the past. \n\nIn contrast, MEMORY 1 contains less specific information about their current working relationship and focuses more on past events that may not be directly relevant to addressing the current workload discussion.\n\nChoice: 2"
