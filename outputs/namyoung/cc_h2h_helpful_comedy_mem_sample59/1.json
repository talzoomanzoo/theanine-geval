    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 2 provides detailed information about the nature and quality of the relationship between the Parent and the Child, emphasizing the importance of their mutual respect, support, and understandingâ€”qualities relevant to the discussion of listening skills and feeling heard. Memory 1, while providing some relevant background, includes details that are less directly connected to the dialogue's focus on being heard and having strong communication. Therefore, Memory 2 is more helpful as it directly contextualizes the conversation within the strong emotional connection and values shared between the Parent and Child.\n\nChoice: 2"
