Co-worker B is also impressed with Co-worker A's well-thought-out plans for their partnership.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nCo-workers A is a hard-working individual who has experienced struggles in the past but is now doing well in their job.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves a conversation where Co-worker A offers help to Co-worker B, who mentioned having a heavy workload and managing it. MEMORY 2 provides relevant information about the supportive dynamic between Co-worker A and Co-worker B. It highlights the mutual support and encouragement present in their relationship, alongside Co-worker B's tendency to offer help, which aligns with the current interaction in the dialogue. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, contains extraneous details about past events and interactions that do not directly pertain to the current offer of assistance regarding workload. Thus, MEMORY 2 is more helpful as it focuses on their supportive relationship, which is relevant to the context of the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 2"
