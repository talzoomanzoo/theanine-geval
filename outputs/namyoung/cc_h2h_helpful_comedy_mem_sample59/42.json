    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a detailed context about Co-workers A and B's positive and supportive relationship. This support may be relevant to Co-worker B's ability to respond appropriately to Co-worker A's worrying plan to 'kidnap' the bride. Understanding their supportive relationship, Co-worker B can provide guidance and emphasize the importance of doing things that truly make others happy, aligned with Co-worker A's values.
