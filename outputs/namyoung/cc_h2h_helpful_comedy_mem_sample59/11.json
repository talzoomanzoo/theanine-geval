    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves the Mentee feeling lonely in a new city, so relevant information would be about their current situation and supportive advice rather than their achievements or past incidents. MEMORY 1 provides more context about the mentee's relocation to a new city due to taking a job, which directly relates to feelings of loneliness and the need for support in adapting to their new environment. MEMORY 2, while giving a broader understanding of the mentee's character and achievements, includes less relevant detail for addressing the loneliness aspect specifically.\n\nChoice: 1"
