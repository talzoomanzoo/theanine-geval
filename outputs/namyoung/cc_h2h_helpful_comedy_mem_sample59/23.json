It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit.\nNeighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Neighbors A and B are excited to start this weekend and are looking forward to it. They haven't seen each other in a while and are catching up. Neighbor B is being comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A.\n\n2. Neighbors A and B, who are not well acquainted, express their desire to spend more time together. As they catch up after a long time, they discuss the temperature inside the house compared to the hotter weather outside. This leads to Neighbor A's mom scolding them for removing the tag from a new shirt.\n\n3. They make plans to hang out weekly, considering activities like watching a movie, getting coffee, or simply talking. Neighbor B, who enjoys cooking, suggests cooking together. Furthermore, Neighbor B's thoughtful suggestion of having extra water available for when Neighbor A mows the lawn shows mutual consideration.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description: Neighbors B is a busy individual who manages to make time for hobbies and friends, suggesting cooking as a hobby. They enjoy spending time with family and work that keeps them occupied. Neighbors B has a cozy home where they enjoy relaxing and hosting gatherings. They value good neighbors and have become good friends with Neighbors A over the years.\n\nRelationship Description: Neighbors A and Neighbors B have developed a close friendship, with Neighbors A expressing a desire to spend more time with Neighbors B. They have shared memories of working together on tasks like mowing the lawn and enjoy spending time together, even suggesting hanging out once a week to watch a movie, grab coffee, and talk.\n\nEvent Description: Neighbors A and Neighbors B have planned to make homemade pizzas together and host a monthly dinner party, rotating hosting duties and inviting other neighbors to join. They have also discussed starting a community tradition together. The two neighbors have shared moments of bonding over chores and activities, showing a willingness to support each other and enjoy each other's company.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 2 provides a more relevant and useful context for the dialogue. It highlights the close friendship and shared activities between Neighbors A and B, which directly contrasts with the conflict in the current dialogue about the cold water incident. This provides a more accurate depiction of their relationship dynamics and shows that, though currently in a disagreement, they have a foundation of friendship and shared experiences to work through conflicts. Memory 1, while it provides a general positive scenario of the neighbors planning to see each other and supporting one another, lacks specific context related to their friendship and shared activities which could help respond to the dialogue about the water incident.\n\nChoice: 2"
