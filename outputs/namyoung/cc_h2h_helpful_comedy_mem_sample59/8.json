    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Child to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life.\nChild: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you.\nParent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you.\nChild: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you?\nParent: Yeah, it was tough. I felt so alone and scared, and I didn't know if anyone would understand what I was going through. But eventually, I found someone who was willing to listen and it made all the difference.\nChild: I'm glad you found someone to talk to. You know, I remember when we watched the sunrise together a few weeks ago. That was really special.\nParent: It was. I love being able to appreciate the beauty of nature. And you know, having my own place to live in the suburbs makes it even easier to do things like that.\nChild: Yeah, your house is really nice. You've always been good at taking care of yourself.\nParent: Well, I've always valued my independence. Even as a kid, I wanted to do things on my own. That's why I decided to live on my own a few years ago. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. The parent values independence and self-sufficiency. This stems from wanting to provide a safe and stable environment for the child.\n2. The child is supportive and proud of their parent for making changes. This reaction was inspired by the parent's story and willingness to appreciate small moments, leading to the parent living in a little house in the suburbs that they love.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nParent is an independent individual who values self-sufficiency and prefers to take care of themselves. They have made mistakes in the past but are focused on creating a safe environment for their child. Parent enjoys watching the sunrise and appreciates the small moments in life. They have their own place in the suburbs and cherish their independence.\n\nRelationship Description:\nThe relationship between Parent and Child is one of love, support, and understanding. Child is always there to offer help and express sympathy towards Parent. They enjoy spending time together, watching the sunrise, and having breakfast in the backyard. Child forgives Parent's mistakes and offers support during tough times.\n\nEvent Description:\nParent recalls waking up early in juvenile detention and finding hope in the darkest situations. They remember the first time watching the sunrise with Child and appreciate the beauty of life even in difficult times. Child suggests watching the sunrise together again, showing their love and excitement for spending time with Parent. Parent is grateful for Child's support and appreciates their presence in their life.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides concise information that directly pertains to the current dialogue, specifically highlighting the parent's values of independence, their living situation, and the child's supportive nature. This aligns closely with the parent's reflections on valuing independence and living alone in the suburbs, as mentioned in the dialogue. MEMORY 2, while also relevant, contains extended details and additional context (such as past mistakes and details about the parent's experiences in juvenile detention) that, while informative, might not be necessary for responding to the current flow of the conversation. Thus, MEMORY 1 remains more focused and directly applicable to enhancing the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 1"
