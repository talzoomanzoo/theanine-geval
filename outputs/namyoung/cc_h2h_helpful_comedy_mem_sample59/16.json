    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Mentee to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends.\nMentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\nMentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here.\nMentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people.\nMentee: Those are good suggestions, Mentor. I'll consider joining a club or volunteering.\nMentor: And remember, it's also important to keep in touch with your old friends. You can schedule video calls or even plan a visit back home. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. The Mentor acknowledges the Mentee's work in advocacy for women and girls and praises their dedication to their values, causing Mentee to agree to go back to the store to make things right and express gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n\n2. Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace in reaction to the Mentor believing the Mentee's work has been influential and that they will continue to make an impact in the world.\n\n3. The Mentee hopes to inspire others to join the cause of gender equality and fighting discrimination, wanting to express gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process. This leads to Mentee feeling overwhelmed with the college application process, which is on the same topic as Mentee taking shoes from the store without paying because they couldn't afford them.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nMentor is a dedicated advocate for women and girls, with years of hard work validated by winning the Nobel Peace Prize. Mentor's dedication has inspired many and they hope to encourage others to join the cause. Mentor is known for fighting against discrimination and advocating for gender equality. They have shown progress and growth over the years and are grateful for the guidance and support they have received.\n\nRelationship Description:\nMentor and Mentee share a close and supportive relationship. Mentor congratulates Mentee on their achievements and acknowledges their dedication. They have deep conversations about important topics such as gender equality and making difficult decisions in line with personal beliefs. Mentor provides guidance and support to Mentee, who values their advice and follows their suggestions.\n\nEvent Description:\nMentee recently made a decision to take a job in the city, showcasing their thoughtful and well-informed decision-making skills. Mentor is proud of Mentee's growth and sees their decision as a reflection of their advocacy work. Additionally, Mentee sought advice from Mentor when feeling overwhelmed with college applications, showing a willingness to listen and learn. In another event, Mentee ran out of a store without paying for new shoes, but after Mentor's advice, they decided to take responsibility and make amends.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is centered around the Mentee adjusting to life in a new city and feeling lonely. The suggestions from the Mentor are about joining clubs, volunteering, and keeping in touch with old friends. Helpful memories would pertain to the Mentee's social adjustment rather than achievements or unrelated issues such as advocacy or college applications.\n\nMemory 1 does not contain information relevant to the current context about loneliness and making new friends. Instead, it focuses on advocacy, college application, and a moral lesson regarding an unrelated event. None of these address the Mentee's immediate concern about forming social connections in a new city.\n\nMemory 2, despite also touching upon different themes like advocacy, provides a broader context about the relationship between the Mentor and the Mentee. It notes past situations where the Mentee sought advice from the Mentor, which can reaffirm the supportive nature of their relationship and potentially encourage the Mentee to take the Mentor's advice seriously regarding social integration in the new environment.\n\nChoice: 2"
