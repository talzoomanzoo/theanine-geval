But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\nMentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here.\nMentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people.\nMentee: Those are good suggestions, Mentor.

We've been hanging out after work sometimes and it's been nice. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves Mentee feeling lonely in a new city, trying to make new friends, and then sharing an update about having made a new friend at work. MEMORY 2 provides a broad background of the Mentee's character and achievements, highlighting their dedication and the supportive nature of the Mentor-Mentee relationship. This context helps in appreciating the Mentee's initiative and current progress, which can guide the Mentor's next response. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, contains specific past events that don't directly relate to the current situation of being in a new city or making friends. While these events illustrate the supportive relationship, they don't offer the same level of directly applicable context as MEMORY 2 does for the current situation.\n\nChoice: 2"
