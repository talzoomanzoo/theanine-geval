    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Co-workers A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it.\nCo-workers B: That's not the same thing, Co-workers A. Stealing someone and keeping them against their will is illegal and immoral. You need to let go of this obsession and move on. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- Co-worker A felt guilty about borrowing a pencil from Co-worker B without asking, similar to how they intervened to separate two women in a fight.\n- Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that intervening in the fight was not a big deal and suggested making it up by buying coffee next time, showing their supportive nature.\n- Co-worker A's bravery and willingness to help were commended by Co-worker B, who admires their resilience and positivity, even in challenging situations like the accident where they lost their hands and feet.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nCo-workers B is a supportive individual who values helping others in need. They acknowledged the importance of assisting others and praised Co-workers A for intervening in a conflict. Co-workers B also offered support to Co-workers A after a car accident, showing their caring and compassionate nature.\n\nRelationship Description:\nCo-workers B and Co-workers A share a supportive and appreciative relationship. Co-workers B praised Co-workers A for their bravery and strength in different situations, showing mutual respect and admiration between them.\n\nEvent Description:\nEvents shared by Co-workers B and Co-workers A include Co-workers A intervening in a fight between two women and talking to the police afterwards. Co-workers B praised Co-workers A for their positive attitude and actions, highlighting their shared value of making the world a better place through kindness and support. Additionally, Co-workers B reassured Co-workers A after borrowing a pencil without asking and suggested making it up by getting coffee, showing a caring and understanding dynamic between them.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides a specific instance that is analogous to the current situation, where Co-worker A borrowed a pencil without asking, and Co-worker B explained why it was important not to act in certain ways. This is directly relevant as Co-worker B is now explaining why Co-worker A should not pursue the plan they mentioned. MEMORY 2, while offering a broader view of their relationship, lacks this specific and relevant comparison to help guide Co-worker A towards understanding the gravity of their current plan.\n\nChoice: 1"
