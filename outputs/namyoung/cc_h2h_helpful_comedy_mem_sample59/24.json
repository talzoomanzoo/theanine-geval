Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit.\nNeighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water.\nNeighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbors A and B, who have known each other for years, plan to hang out once a week, possibly watching a movie, getting coffee, or just talking. They are on friendly terms and enjoy spending time together. Neighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 focuses on the general nature of the relationship between Neighbors A and B, highlighting that they are on friendly terms and enjoy spending time together. This information provides context about the long-standing relationship and the nature of their interactions, which is relevant given the ongoing conflict in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. MEMORY 2, while detailed, focuses too much on specific events and plans that are not relevant to resolving the immediate conflict about the incident with the cold water. MEMORY 1 presents a clearer picture of the mutual enjoyment in the friendship, which might help Neighbors B in deciding how to proceed with the apology and future interactions.\n\nChoice: 1"
