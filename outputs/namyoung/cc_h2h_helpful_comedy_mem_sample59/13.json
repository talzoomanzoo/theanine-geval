It gives context about the nature of their relationship and highlights the Mentee's past experiences with the Mentor, which is helpful in addressing the Mentee's current feelings of loneliness. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, includes information primarily related to work and gender equality advocacy, which may not directly help the Mentor address the Mentee's feelings of isolation.\n\nChoice: 2"
