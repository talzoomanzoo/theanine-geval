    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context shows a disagreement between Neighbors A and B, with Neighbor B expressing frustration over being pushed into cold water by Neighbor A. Memory 1 provides detailed personal interactions and moments, which could be useful to understand their dynamic and reassure Neighbor B of the otherwise positive friendship. However, Memory 2 offers a broader context that still highlights their strong friendship, with shared activities that imply a level of trust, but it less directly addresses the act of pushing B into the water and its effect on their relationship. Memory 1 can directly connect with the dialogue by suggesting ways Neighbor A can mend their current upset, whereas Memory 2 discusses their relationship more generally.\n\nChoice: 1"
