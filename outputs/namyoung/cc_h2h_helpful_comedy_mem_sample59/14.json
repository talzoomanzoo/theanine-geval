    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Mentee to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends.\nMentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\nMentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here.\nMentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- The Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace. Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process, feeling overwhelmed with the college application process, and took shoes from the store without paying because they couldn't afford them.\n- The Mentor has been guiding and supporting the Mentee in their work for years, causing the Mentee to be offered a job and deciding to take the job in the city.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nMentor is a dedicated advocate for women and girls, with years of hard work validated by winning the Nobel Peace Prize. Mentor's dedication has inspired many and they hope to encourage others to join the cause. Mentor is known for fighting against discrimination and advocating for gender equality. They have shown progress and growth over the years and are grateful for the guidance and support they have received.\n\nRelationship Description:\nMentor and Mentee share a close and supportive relationship. Mentor congratulates Mentee on their achievements and acknowledges their dedication. They have deep conversations about important topics such as gender equality and making difficult decisions in line with personal beliefs. Mentor provides guidance and support to Mentee, who values their advice and follows their suggestions.\n\nEvent Description:\nMentee recently made a decision to take a job in the city, showcasing their thoughtful and well-informed decision-making skills. Mentor is proud of Mentee's growth and sees their decision as a reflection of their advocacy work. Additionally, Mentee sought advice from Mentor when feeling overwhelmed with college applications, showing a willingness to listen and learn. In another event, Mentee ran out of a store without paying for new shoes, but after Mentor's advice, they decided to take responsibility and make amends.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains elements that are not directly relevant to the current dialogue context about feeling lonely in a new city, such as the incident of taking shoes from a store. Additionally, it doesn't offer any specific information about the supportive relationship that could help address the current topic of loneliness and making new connections. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, provides a background of a supportive relationship, showcasing how the Mentor has guided the Mentee in the past. It emphasizes the Mentor's credibility and the Mentee's respect for their advice, which aligns well with offering advice on loneliness and making new connections. This MEMORY gives context to the supportive nature of their conversation, enhancing its relevance to the dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 2"
