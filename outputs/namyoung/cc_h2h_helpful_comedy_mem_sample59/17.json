    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context illustrates that the Mentee is feeling lonely in a new city and is looking for guidance on how to adapt. Memory 2 provides a description of the Mentee's character and their close relationship with the Mentor, highlighting their experience dealing with challenges and growth opportunities.
