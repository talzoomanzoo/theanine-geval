    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains bits of information that may give a context of reassurance and support during a decision-making process. However, it doesn't provide specific context about making new connections in a new city, which is the focus of the dialogue. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 provides a detailed user description that emphasizes the Mentee's strengths, like dedication and maturity, which are relevant when discussing the potential to make new friends. It also reinforces the close supportive relationship between Mentor and Mentee, making it more directly relevant to the mentoring dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 2"
