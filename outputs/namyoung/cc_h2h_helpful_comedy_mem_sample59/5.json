    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides relevant contextual information about the strong, supportive relationship between the child and parent, emphasizing the child's empathy and the significance of moments like watching the sunrise together. This memory is directly related to the current conversation topic where the child reminisces about watching the sunrise and the parent acknowledges the listening and understanding of the child. MEMORY 1 contains details that are not immediately relevant to the current dialogue, such as challenges faced during arrest and seeking legal help, which aren't a part of the current conversation. Therefore, MEMORY 2 better supports the context by directly tying into the shared experience of watching the sunrise as part of their empathetic relationship.\n\nChoice: 2"
