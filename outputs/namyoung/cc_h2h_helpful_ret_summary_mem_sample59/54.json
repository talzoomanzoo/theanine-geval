    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Co-workers B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today?\nCo-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing.\nCo-workers A: Do you need any help? I don't want you to get overwhelmed.\nCo-workers B: That's really nice of you, but I don't want to burden you with my work.\nCo-workers A: It's not a burden if it's something I can do to support you. Plus, helping you out makes me feel good too.\nCo-workers B: You're right, thank you. You always go above and beyond to help me out.\nCo-workers A: That's what co-workers are for. We're a team and we need to support each other. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nCo-worker B supports Co-worker A in prioritizing their health and is pleased that Co-worker A is doing well. Co-worker B is grateful for the horse given by Co-worker A, expressing joy and happiness.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A.\n2. Co-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to prioritize their health.\n3. Co-worker B is supportive and glad that Co-worker A is okay.\n4. Co-worker B is glad to have been able to help Co-worker A and feels the trade worked out well for both of them.\n5. Co-worker B agrees that their skill sets complement each other well.\n6. Co-worker A feels motivated about the future and is excited to work with Co-worker B.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 does not directly relate to the current dialogue context, as it focuses on an unrelated scenario about a horse and general support on health. It lacks specific information about workload and team dynamics, which are central to the dialogue. MEMORY 2 provides relevant details about the mutual support and complementary skills between Co-worker A and B, which align with the supportive team context of the dialogue. It emphasizes the ongoing helpful relationship and team spirit, directly relevant to discussing workload support.\n\nChoice: 2"
