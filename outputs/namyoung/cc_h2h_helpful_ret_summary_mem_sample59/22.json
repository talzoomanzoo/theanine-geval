    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbors A and B started spending more time together, eventually becoming good friends who have known each other for years. They catch up frequently, reminiscing about past events and planning to hang out once a week. Neighbors A enjoys the support and comfort Neighbor B provides, while Neighbor B suggests cooking together and shows consideration by offering extra water for lawn mowing.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A.\n2. Neighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\n3. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n4. Neighbors A and B have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside.\n5. Neighbors A and B have not seen each other in a while and are catching up.\n6. Neighbor A's mom scolds them for ripping off the tag from their new shirt.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides a more concise and relevant context for the current dialogue, focusing on the aspects of their friendship and interactions that are most pertinent to the situation, such as spending time together, joking, and having consideration for each other. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 contains more unrelated details like conversations about temperature, a long absence, and an unrelated mention of Neighbors A's mom, which are not directly helpful for responding to the current conversation about the \"joke\" of pushing Neighbors B into cold water.\n\nChoice: 1"
