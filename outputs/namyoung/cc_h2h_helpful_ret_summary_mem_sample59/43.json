    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Co-workers A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Co-worker B commended Co-worker A for their bravery and willingness to help, showing support and willingness to assist in any situation. This led to Co-worker A feeling grateful and appreciative of Co-worker B's help.\n2. Co-worker A witnessed a fight and intervened to separate the two women, displaying bravery and strength. This act of courage is remembered by others, including Co-worker B, who admires Co-worker A's resilience and positivity. Co-worker B also appreciates Co-worker A's positive energy and friendship.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\n2. Co-worker B admires Co-worker A's resilience and positivity.\n3. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's positivity and friendship.\n4. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\n5. Co-worker B is supportive and willing to help in any way.\n6. Co-worker B commended Co-worker A for their bravery and willingness to help.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: In the dialogue context, Co-worker A is discussing a concerning plan to interfere with someone's wedding and expresses a misguided notion of love. Co-worker B responds by advocating for respect and highlighting the inappropriateness of such actions. MEMORY 1 doesn't provide relevant support for Co-worker B's response about respecting the bride's decisions and feelings as it focuses more on unrelated past events like fights and commending bravery. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, contains mentions of Co-worker B's positivity, resilience, and willingness to help, which could be part of reinforcing the notion of proper supportive behavior and what constitutes a healthy relationship.\n\nChoice: 2"
