It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit.\nNeighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water.\nNeighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it.\nNeighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again.\nNeighbors A: I won't. So, do you remember the time when I mowed the lawn with that old push mower?\nNeighbors B: Yeah, I remember that. That was pretty tough work.\nNeighbors A: It was. But it was also a good workout.\nNeighbors B: I prefer to work out indoors where there's air conditioning.\nNeighbors A: Ha, I remember when I took off my jacket and put my feet up in your armchair. It was so warm that day.\nNeighbors B: Yeah, that was a hot day. I'm glad you felt comfortable in my home though.\nNeighbors A: You know, I really enjoy spending time with you. I want to get to know you even better.\nNeighbors B: I feel the same way. We should plan something fun to do together.\nNeighbors A: Absolutely. Hey, do you remember when I ripped off the tag from my shirt?\nNeighbors B: Yeah, your mom was pretty upset about that.\nNeighbors A: I didn't think it was a big deal, but she sure did. Do you ever have disagreements like that with your parents?\nNeighbors B: Sometimes, but not often. We have a pretty good relationship.\nNeighbors A: That's great to hear. I hope I have a good relationship with my kids someday. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbors A and B have a strong desire to begin this weekend and eagerly anticipate it.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a concise set of relevant points that directly relate to the dialogue context. It highlights the personal relationship between Neighbors A and B, their shared experiences and enjoyment of outdoor activities, and a plan that connects with the dialogue's focus on spending quality time together. This makes it directly useful for Neighbors B to engage with Neighbors A in a way that aligns with their past interactions and future intentions. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, includes extraneous details about Neighbors A's personal pressures, which are not immediately relevant or helpful to the ongoing conversation about shared activities and camaraderie.\n\nChoice: 2"
