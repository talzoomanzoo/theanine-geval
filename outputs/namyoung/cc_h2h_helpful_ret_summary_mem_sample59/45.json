    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Co-workers A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it.\nCo-workers B: That's not the same thing, Co-workers A. Stealing someone and keeping them against their will is illegal and immoral. You need to let go of this obsession and move on. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- Co-worker A felt guilty about borrowing a pencil from Co-worker B without asking, similar to how they intervened to separate two women in a fight.\n- Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that intervening in the fight was not a big deal and suggested making it up by buying coffee next time, showing their supportive nature.\n- Co-worker A's bravery and willingness to help were commended by Co-worker B, who admires their resilience and positivity, even in challenging situations like the accident where they lost their hands and feet.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\n2. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\n3. Co-worker B admires Co-worker A's resilience and positivity.\n4. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's positivity and friendship.\n5. Co-worker A is alive but will need time to adjust to their new way of life.\n6. Co-worker B is supportive and willing to help in any way.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a straightforward account of the pencil borrowing incident, which directly parallels Co-worker A's feeling of guilt in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This makes the reference clear and emphasizes Co-worker B's supportive nature. The information about resilience and positive traits further contextualizes their interaction, although not directly relevant to the current situation. MEMORY 1 adds unnecessary detail about the fight intervention and accident, which do not relate to the current conversation about the bride and the citation of borrowing a pencil.\n\nChoice: 2"
