    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Co-workers A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today?\nCo-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Co-worker B offered help and support to Co-worker A, which made Co-worker B feel supportive and glad that Co-worker A is okay. This positive interaction led to Co-worker A having a good job and doing well, despite their difficult upbringing.\n\n2. Co-worker B supported and encouraged Co-worker A to prioritize their health, leading to Co-worker A borrowing a horse from Co-worker B and having a great time riding it. This act of kindness made Co-worker B glad and feeling like the trade worked out well for both of them. Additionally, Co-worker B was impressed by Co-worker A's well-thought-out plans for their partnership.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker A now has a good job and is doing well, despite their difficult upbringing.\n2. Co-worker B is supportive and glad that Co-worker A is okay.\n3. Co-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to prioritize their health.\n4. Co-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A.\n5. Co-worker A values their health to continue working at their best.\n6. Co-worker A feels motivated about the future and is excited to work with Co-worker B.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context involves Co-worker A inquiring about Co-worker B's workload, and Co-worker B expressing that they are managing despite it being heavy. The relevant context from the memories would provide Co-worker A with information about Co-worker B's supportive nature and their mutual working relationship. This context would enable Co-worker A to respond appropriately, perhaps offering assistance or expressing gratitude for Co-worker B's support.\n\nMemory 1 focuses on specific past interactions related to support and borrowing a horse, which may not directly help Co-worker A respond to the immediate conversation about the workload. In contrast, Memory 2 provides a broader view of the support and encouragement dynamics between Co-worker A and B, highlighting Co-worker Bâ€™s supportive nature, which is more directly relevant to the current dialogue.\n\nChoice: 2"
