    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbors A and B are on friendly terms and enjoy spending time together. They have known each other for years and have become good friends. Neighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A. \nNeighbors A and B have not seen each other in a while and are catching up. They have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside. Neighbor A's mom scolds them for ripping off the tag from their new shirt. \nNeighbors B enjoys cooking and suggests making something together. They suggest having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbors A and B have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside.\n2. Neighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A.\n3. Neighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\n4. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n5. Neighbor A's mom scolds them for ripping off the tag from their new shirt.\n6. Neighbors A and B have not seen each other in a while and are catching up.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 includes more information about the friendly and supportive relationship between Neighbors A and B, which provides useful context for Neighbor A's playful action of pushing Neighbor B into the water. This context is relevant for understanding the dialogue, as it suggests that Neighbor A's action may have been intended as a friendly joke rather than an aggressive act. MEMORY 2 also contains similar information but less explicitly highlights the friendly and supportive dynamic between the neighbors. Therefore, MEMORY 1 slightly provides more relevant context for understanding the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 1"
