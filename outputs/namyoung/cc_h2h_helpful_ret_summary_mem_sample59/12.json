    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides more relevant information regarding the Mentee's current situation of feeling lonely in a new city. It mentions the Mentee's recent decision to take a job in the city, which directly relates to their current feeling of loneliness and the opportunity to meet new people. This piece of information is useful as it connects the Mentee's current emotional state to their recent actions, offering context that can guide the Mentor's response. MEMORY 2, although it includes some overlapping points, introduces unrelated details such as the college application process and lacks the context of the Mentee's new job in connection to their current situation.\n\nChoice: 1"
