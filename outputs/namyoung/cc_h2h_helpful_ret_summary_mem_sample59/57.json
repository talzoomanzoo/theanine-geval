Plus, helping you out makes me feel good too.\nCo-workers B: You're right, thank you. You always go above and beyond to help me out.\nCo-workers A: That's what co-workers are for. We're a team and we need to support each other.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of teamwork, remember when you showed me your plans for the future a few months ago? I'm still excited about the idea of working on a project together.\nCo-workers A: Me too! I think we would make a great business partnership.\nCo-workers B: Definitely. It's great to have someone I can trust and rely on in both work and personal matters. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nCo-worker A is grateful to Co-worker B for letting them borrow the horse and is having a great time riding her. This has motivated Co-worker A about the future and made them excited to work with Co-worker B.\nCo-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to prioritize their health, while also being impressed with Co-worker A's well-thought-out plans for their partnership.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker B is impressed with Co-worker A's well-thought-out plans for their partnership.\n2. Co-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A.\n3.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a concise and directly relevant summary of the positive dynamic between Co-workers A and B, specifically focusing on their mutual support and shared enthusiasm for future collaboration. Each point in MEMORY 2 is related to the existing dialogue, enhancing Co-worker A's ability to engage meaningfully with Co-worker B's remarks about teamwork and future projects. On the other hand, MEMORY 1 introduces irrelevant information about a horse, which does not pertain to the partnership or teamwork discussion and could lead to confusion.\n\nChoice: 2"
