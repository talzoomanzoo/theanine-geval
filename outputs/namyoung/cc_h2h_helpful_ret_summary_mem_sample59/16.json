    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Mentee to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends.\nMentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\nMentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here.\nMentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people.\nMentee: Those are good suggestions, Mentor. I'll consider joining a club or volunteering.\nMentor: And remember, it's also important to keep in touch with your old friends. You can schedule video calls or even plan a visit back home. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. The Mentor acknowledges the Mentee's work in advocacy for women and girls and praises their dedication to their values, causing Mentee to agree to go back to the store to make things right and express gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n\n2. Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace in reaction to the Mentor believing the Mentee's work has been influential and that they will continue to make an impact in the world.\n\n3. The Mentee hopes to inspire others to join the cause of gender equality and fighting discrimination, wanting to express gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process. This leads to Mentee feeling overwhelmed with the college application process, which is on the same topic as Mentee taking shoes from the store without paying because they couldn't afford them.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace.\n2. Mentee agreed to go back to the store to make things right and expressed gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n3. Mentee is feeling overwhelmed with the college application process.\n4. The Mentee has been offered a job and has decided to take the job in the city.\n5. Mentor advises Mentee to break down studying into manageable chunks, schedule study sessions and breaks, and use resources like practice exams and review books.\n6. Mentor emphasizes the importance of self-care for dealing with challenges.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories contain various points of information related to the Mentor and Mentee. MEMORY 1 includes information about advocacy for women and girls, the Mentee being overwhelmed with college applications, and encouragement for going back to a store. MEMORY 2 shares some more generalized advice about dealing with academic pressures and self-care. However, neither directly relates to social integration or loneliness, which is the primary topic in the dialogue context. Though they aren't perfectly relevant, MEMORY 2 offers a broader range of advice on challenges that could be indirectly helpful, such as self-care and adapting to new environments (e.g., job in a new city). Both memories lack specifics about dealing directly with social loneliness, but MEMORY 2 is slightly more relevant.\n\nChoice: 2"
