    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit.\nNeighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water.\nNeighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbors A and B, who have known each other for years, plan to hang out once a week, possibly watching a movie, getting coffee, or just talking. They are on friendly terms and enjoy spending time together. Neighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A. They reminisce about past events and cherish their friendship.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A.\n2. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n3. Neighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\n4. Neighbors A and B have not seen each other in a while and are catching up.\n5. Neighbors A and B have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside.\n6. Neighbors A and B are on friendly terms and enjoy spending time together.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: To respond appropriately in the given dialogue context, it is crucial to focus on the relationship dynamics and interactions between Neighbors A and B. Memory 2 contains more detailed interactions and considerations between the neighbors, such as planning for future activities and past conversations, which can provide context on their relationship and how they resolve small conflicts or show consideration for each other. This detail can help Neighbors B respond in a way that acknowledges their friendship and past interactions while addressing the current issue. On the other hand, Memory 1 generally describes their relationship but lacks specific instances or dynamics that can aid in understanding the context better.\n\nChoice: 2"
