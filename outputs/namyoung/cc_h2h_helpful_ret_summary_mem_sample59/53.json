    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Co-workers A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today?\nCo-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing.\nCo-workers A: Do you need any help? I don't want you to get overwhelmed.\nCo-workers B: That's really nice of you, but I don't want to burden you with my work.\nCo-workers A: It's not a burden if it's something I can do to support you. Plus, helping you out makes me feel good too.\nCo-workers B: You're right, thank you. You always go above and beyond to help me out. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nCo-worker B supports and encourages Co-worker A to prioritize their health. This leads to Co-worker B feeling glad that Co-worker A is okay. Additionally, Co-worker B is impressed with Co-worker A's well-thought-out plans for their partnership. \nCo-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A, resulting in Co-worker A being grateful for the assistance. Subsequently, Co-worker B is pleased with the outcome of their trade and acknowledges that their skills complement each other well.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A.\n2. Co-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to prioritize their health.\n3. Co-worker B is glad to have been able to help Co-worker A and feels the trade worked out well for both of them.\n4. Co-worker B is supportive and glad that Co-worker A is okay.\n5. Co-worker A expressed gratitude for the horse that Co-worker B gave them, mentioning it brings joy and happiness.\n6. Co-worker A feels motivated about the future and is excited to work with Co-worker B.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The required memory must focus on Co-worker A offering help and Co-worker B's appreciation of this offer. Memory 1 details an instance where Co-worker B offers help to Co-worker A, but it does include other information that is irrelevant to the current dialogue context. Memory 2, however, provides more context on how Co-worker B has previously offered help, appreciates mutual efforts, and feels good about their shared outcomes, which aligns more directly with the current conversation where Co-worker A is offering assistance and Co-worker B is thankful.\n\nChoice: 2"
