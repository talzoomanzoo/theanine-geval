    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit.\nNeighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water.\nNeighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it.\nNeighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again.\nNeighbors A: I won't. So, do you remember the time when I mowed the lawn with that old push mower?\nNeighbors B: Yeah, I remember that. That was pretty tough work.\nNeighbors A: It was. But it was also a good workout.\nNeighbors B: I prefer to work out indoors where there's air conditioning.\nNeighbors A: Ha, I remember when I took off my jacket and put my feet up in your armchair. It was so warm that day.\nNeighbors B: Yeah, that was a hot day. I'm glad you felt comfortable in my home though.\nNeighbors A: You know, I really enjoy spending time with you. I want to get to know you even better. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbors A and B, who have known each other for years, enjoy spending time together and want to get to know each other even better. They reminisce about past events and plan to hang out once a week, possibly watching a movie, getting coffee, or just talking. Both neighbors enjoy spending time outside and doing chores like mowing the lawn. Additionally, Neighbor A particularly enjoys spending time in Neighbor B's cozy home and wants to hang out more often.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Both Neighbors A and B enjoy spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn.\n2. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n3. Neighbor A enjoys spending time in Neighbor B's cozy home and wants to hang out more often.\n4. Neighbors A and B are on friendly terms and enjoy spending time together.\n5. Neighbors A and B have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside.\n6. Neighbors A and B plan to work on mowing the lawn together next time to make it easier and possibly discover more things in common.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: While both memories provide insight into the relationship between the neighbors, MEMORY 1 is slightly more concise and directly relevant to the intent expressed by Neighbor Aâ€”to get to know Neighbor B even better and spend more time together. It confirms they already enjoy each other's company and share past experiences, aligning closely with the current dialogue, where Neighbor A expresses a desire to grow closer. MEMORY 1 encapsulates the supportive and friendly nature of their relationship and potential future activities, without extraneous detail.\n\nChoice: 1"
