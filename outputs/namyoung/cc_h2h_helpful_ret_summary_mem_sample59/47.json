    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Co-workers A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it.\nCo-workers B: That's not the same thing, Co-workers A. Stealing someone and keeping them against their will is illegal and immoral. You need to let go of this obsession and move on.\nCo-workers A: I know you're right, Co-workers B. I just don't know how to get over this feeling.\nCo-workers B: Maybe try talking to someone about it. A therapist or a trusted friend. They can help you work through these emotions in a healthy way. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nCo-worker B's willingness to help others was evident when they assisted a customer last week. This trait was further highlighted when Co-worker A borrowed a pencil without asking and felt guilty about it. \nAfter Co-worker A spoke with the police about the incident, the women involved were thankful. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\nReflecting on Co-worker B's past actions, Co-worker A is remembered for their bravery and strength in various situations. Co-worker B admires Co-worker A's resilience and positivity, noting their ability to stay optimistic even in challenging circumstances, such as the accident where they lost their hands and feet.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\n2. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\n3. Co-worker B admires Co-worker A's resilience and positivity.\n4. Co-worker A is alive but will need time to adjust to their new way of life.\n5. Co-worker B is supportive and willing to help in any way.\n6. Co-worker A is trying to stay positive and focus on their recovery, despite it being a daunting task.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 contains concise and relevant information about Co-worker A's feelings of guilt over borrowing a pencil, and Co-worker B's supportive nature, which directly relates to the current dialogue about Co-worker A's guilt over their feelings of love and the need for support. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, includes unrelated information about Co-worker B's interaction with the police and Co-worker A's accident, making it less focused for generating a contextually appropriate response.\n\nChoice: 2"
