I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here.\nMentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people.\nMentee: Those are good suggestions, Mentor. I'll consider joining a club or volunteering. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1.

    "prediction": "Explanation: \nThe dialogue context is about the Mentee feeling lonely in a new city and considering joining clubs or volunteering as suggested by the Mentor. The more helpful memory should contain relevant information related to adjusting to a new city, making decisions, or feelings of loneliness. MEMORY 1 includes a point about the Mentee deciding to take a job in the city and wanting to inspire others, which suggests a positive step towards integration into the new environment. MEMORY 2, while similar, includes extra information about the mentee's decision-making process which indirectly aligns with the support and adjustment theme but retains details unrelated to the Mentee's current emotional state (like the college process and store incident).\n\nChoice: 1"
