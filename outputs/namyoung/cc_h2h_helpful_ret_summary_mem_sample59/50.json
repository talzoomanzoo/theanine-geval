    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Co-workers B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today?\nCo-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing.\nCo-workers A: Do you need any help? I don't want you to get overwhelmed. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- Co-worker A is considering seeing a doctor to ensure everything is okay and Co-worker B is supportive and glad that Co-worker A is okay. Co-worker B was surprised to learn about Co-worker A's past struggles.\n- Co-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A, and Co-worker A is grateful to Co-worker B for letting them borrow the horse and is having a great time riding her. This act changed Co-worker B to be glad to have been able to help Co-worker A and feel the trade worked out well for both of them. Co-worker B is also impressed with Co-worker A's well-thought-out plans for their partnership.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A.\n2. Co-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to prioritize their health.\n3. Co-worker B is supportive and glad that Co-worker A is okay.\n4. Co-worker A values their health to continue working at their best.\n5. Both co-workers are looking forward to starting their partnership and are open to seeking extra help if needed.\n6. Co-worker A is considering seeing a doctor to ensure everything is okay.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more helpful because it contains relevant points that show Co-worker B's supportive nature, like offering help and support and encouraging Co-worker A to prioritize their health. These points align with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Co-worker A is offering help to Co-worker B, and it would be useful for Co-worker B to know how their own supportive actions are appreciated reciprocally. MEMORY 1 includes details about unrelated activities like borrowing a horse, which do not contribute to the context of offering help or managing workload. \n\nChoice: 2"
