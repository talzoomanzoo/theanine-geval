Within this context, MEMORY 1 mentions a shared experience (borrowing a horse), which may not be directly relevant to the conversation about collaboration and workloads. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 provides details about their mutual admiration and their aspirations for a future partnership, which is more directly related to the conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
