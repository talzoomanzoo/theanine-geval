    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Parent to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life.\nChild: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations, which caused them to now live in a little house in the suburbs that they love.\n2. The child's supportive and caring nature towards the parent makes the parent want to provide a safe and stable environment, as they value independence and self-sufficiency.\n3. Both the parent and child express love and support for each other, with the child finding the parent's story inspiring as the parent mentions making mistakes in the past and trying to turn their life around.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. The child is supportive and caring towards the parent.\n2. Both the parent and child express love and support for each other.\n3. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations.\n4. The child is supportive and proud of their parent for making changes.\n5. The parent values independence and self-sufficiency.\n6. The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 contains more relevant information stating specifically that the child is supportive and proud of their parent for making changes, which aligns well with the child's feeling of being heard and supports the dialogue context about valuing listening. However, this extended information is not necessarily more helpful or useful in formulating a response to the child's statement. MEMORY 1 provides necessary and contextually relevant aspects, emphasizing mutual support and the impact of listening, without extraneous details.\n\nChoice: 1"
