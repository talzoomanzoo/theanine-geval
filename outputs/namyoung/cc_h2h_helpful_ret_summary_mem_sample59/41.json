It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Co-worker A witnessed a fight and intervened to separate the two women. Co-worker B is supportive and willing to help in any way. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\n2. Co-worker B commended Co-worker A for their bravery and willingness to help. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\n3. Co-worker B mentioned helping a customer resolve an issue last week, showing a willingness to assist others. Co-worker A is alive but will need time to adjust to their new way of life.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\n2.

Co-worker A is alive but will need time to adjust to their new way of life.\n4. Co-worker B admires Co-worker A's resilience and positivity.\n5. Co-worker B commended Co-worker A for their bravery and willingness to help.\n6. Co-worker B is supportive and willing to help in any way.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves Co-worker A expressing an intention to kidnap someone, and Co-worker B objecting to it. Relevant information to help Co-worker A respond would need to reflect any previous conversations about legality, morality, or any history of joking or serious talk about such actions. However, both memories provided do not strictly contain information directly related to stopping Co-worker A or reflecting on the gravity of the situation, but MEMORY 2 indicates a supportive dynamic and previously established moral guidance (\"bravery and willingness to help\"), which could help defuse the current situation.\n\nChoice: 2"
