    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Child to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life.\nChild: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you.\nParent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you.\nChild: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you?\nParent: Yeah, it was tough. I felt so alone and scared, and I didn't know if anyone would understand what I was going through. But eventually, I found someone who was willing to listen and it made all the difference.\nChild: I'm glad you found someone to talk to. You know, I remember when we watched the sunrise together a few weeks ago. That was really special.\nParent: It was. I love being able to appreciate the beauty of nature. And you know, having my own place to live in the suburbs makes it even easier to do things like that. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. The Parent and Child enjoy watching the sunrise together, finding it special and memorable.\n2. The Parent's past mistakes lead to finding hope and appreciating small moments, aiming to turn their life around.\n3. The Child is inspired by the Parent's story and suggests continuing the sunrise-watching tradition in the future.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations.\n2. The child recalls a memorable morning watching the sunrise with the parent.\n3. The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring.\n4. The child is supportive and caring towards the parent.\n5. The child is supportive and proud of their parent for making changes.\n6. The Parent eventually got to see the sunrise after leaving detention.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains relevant information about the Parent and Child's shared experience of watching the sunrise, their appreciation of small moments, and the Child's inspiration from the Parent's story, all of which are pertinent to the ongoing dialogue context. This aligns with the Child's attempt to link the discussion about listening and feeling heard to a special memory they share. MEMORY 2, while also containing relevant information, includes additional details such as the Parent seeing the sunrise after leaving detention and the Child's broader supportive attitude which are not directly necessary for the immediate continuation of the dialogue. Thus, MEMORY 1 is more succinct and focused on the elements critical to the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 1"
