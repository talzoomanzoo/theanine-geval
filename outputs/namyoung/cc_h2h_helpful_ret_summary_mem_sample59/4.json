    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Child to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life.\nChild: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you.\nParent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you.\nChild: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you?\nParent: Yeah, it was tough. I felt so alone and scared, and I didn't know if anyone would understand what I was going through. But eventually, I found someone who was willing to listen and it made all the difference. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nThe child's support and care towards the parent led to the parent being in juvenile detention in the past, where they made mistakes and are now trying to turn their life around.\nThe parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations, which caused them to now live in a little house in the suburbs that they love.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations.\n2. The child is supportive and caring towards the parent.\n3. The child is supportive and proud of their parent for making changes.\n4. The child offers help and reassurance to the parent.\n5. The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring.\n6. Both the parent and child express love and support for each other.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context involves a discussion about the importance of listening and the parent's past experience in detention. MEMORY 1 provides relevant information about the parent's past in juvenile detention and their journey since then. This information is directly related to the dialogue context's focus on past experiences and how being listened to made a difference. MEMORY 2, while containing helpful and supportive sentiments about the overall relationship between the parent and child, lacks specific details about the parent's past detention experience and how listening was pivotal in that context.\n\nChoice: 1"
