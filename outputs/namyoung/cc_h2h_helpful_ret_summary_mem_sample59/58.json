    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Co-workers B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today?\nCo-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing.\nCo-workers A: Do you need any help? I don't want you to get overwhelmed.\nCo-workers B: That's really nice of you, but I don't want to burden you with my work.\nCo-workers A: It's not a burden if it's something I can do to support you. Plus, helping you out makes me feel good too.\nCo-workers B: You're right, thank you. You always go above and beyond to help me out.\nCo-workers A: That's what co-workers are for. We're a team and we need to support each other.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of teamwork, remember when you showed me your plans for the future a few months ago? I'm still excited about the idea of working on a project together.\nCo-workers A: Me too! I think we would make a great business partnership.\nCo-workers B: Definitely. It's great to have someone I can trust and rely on in both work and personal matters.\nCo-workers A: I agree. We have a good working dynamic and I'm happy to help out whenever I can. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nCo-worker B is impressed with Co-worker A's well-thought-out plans for their partnership and encourages Co-worker A to prioritize their health.\n\nCo-worker A feels motivated about the future and is excited to work with Co-worker B, which causes Co-worker B to be glad to have been able to help Co-worker A and feel the trade worked out well for both of them.\n\nCo-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A, leading to Co-worker A offering Person Z to Co-worker B in exchange for one of their horses and expressing gratitude for the joy and happiness the horse brings.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A.\n2. Co-worker B is impressed with Co-worker A's well-thought-out plans for their partnership.\n3. Co-worker A feels motivated about the future and is excited to work with Co-worker B.\n4. Co-worker B is glad to have been able to help Co-worker A and feels the trade worked out well for both of them.\n5. Co-workers A and B have a positive and optimistic attitude towards their future collaboration.\n6. Co-worker B agrees that their skill sets complement each other well.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a clear and succinct summary of the relevant points, maintaining focus on the collaborative aspect without deviating into unrelated details. It highlights the supportive dynamic, mutual satisfaction, and complementary skill sets, all of which are pertinent to the ongoing discussion about teamwork and future plans. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, introduces a confusing element (Person Z and the horse trade) that is not relevant to the Dialogue Context and may distract from the conversation's main thread.\n\nChoice: 2"
