It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nCo-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\nCo-worker A spoke with the police about the incident and the women involved were thankful.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\n2. Co-worker B is supportive and willing to help in any way.\n3. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\n4. Co-worker A is remembered for being brave and strong in past situations.\n5. Co-worker B admires Co-worker A's resilience and positivity.\n6. Co-worker A is alive but will need time to adjust to their new way of life.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context involves Co-worker A expressing an intention to prevent a bride from getting married by abducting her. This is a serious statement that involves potentially illegal actions. MEMORY 2 provides more context about the relationship and characteristics of Co-worker A and Co-worker B, such as their resilience, bravery, and supportive nature. However, this information is not directly relevant to the specific, potentially serious situation described in the dialogue context. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, contains a mention of police involvement with Co-worker A, which could be relevant to the discussion about preventing a marriage, if interpreted as an existing concern with legal or ethical matters. Although the details are vague, the mention of police adds a layer of potential relevance to MEMORY 1 that MEMORY 2 lacks.\n\nChoice: 1"
