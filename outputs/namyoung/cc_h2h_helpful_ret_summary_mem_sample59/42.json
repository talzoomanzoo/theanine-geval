It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Co-worker B mentioned helping a customer resolve an issue last week, showing a willingness to assist others. This reminds Co-worker A of the time when Co-worker B was supportive and willing to help in any way. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it. \n2. Co-worker A spoke with the police about the incident and the women involved were thankful. In reaction, Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time. \n3. Co-worker B mentioned helping a customer resolve an issue last week, showing a willingness to assist others. This made Co-worker A remember how brave and strong Co-worker A has been in past situations. This further led to Co-worker B admiring Co-worker A's resilience and positivity, and eventually appreciating Co-worker A's positivity and friendship.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\n2. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\n3. Co-worker B admires Co-worker A's resilience and positivity.\n4. Co-worker B is supportive and willing to help in any way.\n5. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's positivity and friendship.\n6. Co-worker A is alive but will need time to adjust to their new way of life.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a concise and relevant subset of information about past interactions that can help guide Co-worker B in addressing the current situation. Specifically, it highlights Co-worker B's supportive nature, which can be crucial for offering guidance or reasoning with Co-worker A about the seriousness of the situation regarding the bride. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, contains extraneous details about an unrelated past event involving police and does not offer any additional help in crafting a response to Co-worker A's plan to \"steal\" someone because of love.\n\nChoice: 2"
