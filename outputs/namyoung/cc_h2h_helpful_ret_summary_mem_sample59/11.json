    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT indicates that the Mentee is feeling lonely in a new city and misses their old friends. For the Mentor to effectively respond to this context, the MEMORY should provide relevant information about the Mentee's recent move, feelings, and any supportive advice previously given by the Mentor. MEMORY 2 is more focused on the Mentee's situation in the city (point 2) and includes supportive reassurance (point 3) which aligns with addressing feelings of loneliness. The inclusion of gratitude (point 4) indicates an established supportive relationship. Overall, MEMORY 2 provides a more accurate context for the Mentor’s response to the Mentee’s current feelings of loneliness in a new city.\n\nChoice: 2"
