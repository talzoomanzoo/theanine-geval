    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Mentor to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends.\nMentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\nMentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here.\nMentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people.\nMentee: Those are good suggestions, Mentor. I'll consider joining a club or volunteering.\nMentor: And remember, it's also important to keep in touch with your old friends. You can schedule video calls or even plan a visit back home.\nMentee: That's true, I'll make sure to keep in touch. Thanks for the advice, Mentor.\nMentor: Anytime, Mentee. Is there anything else you want to talk about or any updates you'd like to share?\nMentee: Actually, I did make a new friend at work. We've been hanging out after work sometimes and it's been nice. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. The Mentor acknowledges the Mentee's work in advocacy for women and girls and praises their dedication to their values, which caused Mentee to agree to go back to the store to make things right and express gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n2. The Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace, reacting to the Mentor's belief that the Mentee's work has been influential and that they will continue to make an impact in the world.\n3. The Mentor has been guiding and supporting the Mentee in their work for years, leading to the Mentee being offered a job and deciding to take the job in the city.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace.\n2. Mentee agreed to go back to the store to make things right and expressed gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n3. The Mentee has been offered a job and has decided to take the job in the city.\n4. The Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process.\n5. The Mentor is supportive and praises the Mentee for their mature decision-making process.\n6. The Mentee weighed the pros and cons of each option before deciding on the job in the city.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more helpful because it contains specific, relevant details about the Mentee's recent life changes, such as moving to a new city, making a decision to take a job there, and the Mentor's involvement in the decision-making process. These details align closely with the current dialogue context, where the Mentee discusses feeling lonely in a new city and starting to make new friends. MEMORY 1, while containing some related elements, includes information about advocacy work and values that are not directly relevant to the current situation discussed in the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 2"
