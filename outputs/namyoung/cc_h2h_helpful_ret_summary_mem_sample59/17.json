    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Mentor to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends.\nMentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\nMentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here.\nMentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people.\nMentee: Those are good suggestions, Mentor. I'll consider joining a club or volunteering.\nMentor: And remember, it's also important to keep in touch with your old friends. You can schedule video calls or even plan a visit back home.\nMentee: That's true, I'll make sure to keep in touch. Thanks for the advice, Mentor. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. The Mentor has been guiding and supporting the Mentee in their work for years. As a result, the Mentee agreed to go back to the store to make things right and expressed gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n\n2. The Mentor believes the Mentee's work has been influential and that they will continue to make an impact in the world. In response, Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace.\n\n3. The Mentor believes the Mentee's work has been influential and that they will continue to make an impact in the world. The Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process, and subsequently, Mentee is feeling overwhelmed with the college application process. This situation is similar to when Mentee took shoes from the store without paying because they couldn't afford them.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace.\n2. Mentee agreed to go back to the store to make things right and expressed gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n3. The Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process.\n4. Mentor advises Mentee to break down studying into manageable chunks, schedule study sessions and breaks, and use resources like practice exams and review books.\n5. The Mentee has been offered a job and has decided to take the job in the city.\n6. Mentee is feeling overwhelmed with the college application process.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is about the Mentee dealing with loneliness in a new city and considering joining clubs or volunteering to meet people. Memory 1 includes information about the Mentee being guided by the Mentor and feeling overwhelmed with other issues (like college applications and a past incident involving stealing shoes), which are not directly relevant or helpful in addressing the current loneliness issue. On the other hand, Memory 2 also includes extraneous details, but it mentions the Mentee being offered a job in the city, which could relate to discussing ways to integrate into the new environment. However, despite this small relevance, both memories mostly contain unrelated information to the dialogue context.\n\nChoice: tie"
