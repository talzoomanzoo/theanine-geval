    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Mentee to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends.\nMentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\nMentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here.\nMentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people.\nMentee: Those are good suggestions, Mentor. I'll consider joining a club or volunteering.\nMentor: And remember, it's also important to keep in touch with your old friends. You can schedule video calls or even plan a visit back home.\nMentee: That's true, I'll make sure to keep in touch. Thanks for the advice, Mentor.\nMentor: Anytime, Mentee. Is there anything else you want to talk about or any updates you'd like to share? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- The Mentor has been guiding and supporting the Mentee in their work for years. This has led to the Mentor being supportive and praising the Mentee for their mature decision-making process, which made the Mentee agree to go back to the store to make things right and express gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n- The Mentor believes the Mentee's work has been influential and that they will continue to make an impact in the world. This resulted in Mentor reassuring Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace.\n- The Mentee hopes to inspire others to join the cause of gender equality and fighting discrimination. As a result, the Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process, causing the Mentee to agree to go back to the store to make things right and express gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace.\n2. Mentee agreed to go back to the store to make things right and expressed gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n3. The Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process.\n4. The Mentor is supportive and praises the Mentee for their mature decision-making process.\n5. Mentor advises Mentee to break down studying into manageable chunks, schedule study sessions and breaks, and use resources like practice exams and review books.\n6. Mentee is feeling overwhelmed with the college application process.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 both include information about the Mentor's supportive nature, but MEMORY 1 includes additional, unnecessary context about the Mentee's work being influential and goals related to gender equality, which are unrelated to the current concern of loneliness in a new city. MEMORY 2 provides a more concise and relevant recap of supportive actions, without veering off into unrelated topics. Therefore, it is more helpful for guiding the current dialogue.\n\nChoice: 2"
