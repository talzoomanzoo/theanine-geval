    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit.\nNeighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water.\nNeighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it.\nNeighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbors A and B started off not knowing each other well but wanting to spend more time together. As time passed, they became good friends and enjoy reminiscing about past events. Neighbors B, who is supportive, suggests making something together and shows consideration by suggesting having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\n2. Neighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A.\n3. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n4. Neighbors A and B have not seen each other in a while and are catching up.\n5. Neighbors A and B have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside.\n6. Neighbors A and Neighbors B are both neighbors who have known each other for years and have become good friends.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 both indicate that Neighbors A and B have a good friendship and provide details about their interactions. However, MEMORY 1 is more concise and directly relevant to the idea of being considerate and supportive, which aligns with Neighbors A apologizing and Neighbors B wanting them to not repeat the behavior. It focuses on their friendship evolving and supportive actions, which could be pertinent to understanding their dynamics in the context of resolving the recent incident. MEMORY 2, while providing similar information, includes less relevant details like conversations about temperature and not seeing each other for a while, which do not contribute to the context of the current dialogue about the apology and assurance.\n\nChoice: 1"
