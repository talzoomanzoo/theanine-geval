    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim.  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\nSpeaker A knows how to swim since the age of 5 and offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\nSpeaker B does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies; looking forward to eating a pizza burger in a pool with punk music playing.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n2. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n3. Speaker B is looking forward to eating a pizza burger in a pool with punk music playing.\n4. Speaker A finds swimming relaxing and uses it to destress from their job.\n5. Speaker B does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies.\n6. Speaker A recommends hiking and exploring the local area for those who can't swim.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains relevant information about Speaker B's enjoyment of punk music, their inability to swim, and interest in a pizza burger, which ties directly to the dialogue context. It also includes Speaker A's ability to swim and their offer to teach swimming, which is directly relevant to Speaker B's hope to learn swimming. \n\nMEMORY 2 contains all the same points but also includes additional information about Speaker A's personal feelings towards swimming and an unrelated recommendation about hiking, which are not directly relevant to the dialogue context about the weekend meetup plans.\n\nChoice: 1"
