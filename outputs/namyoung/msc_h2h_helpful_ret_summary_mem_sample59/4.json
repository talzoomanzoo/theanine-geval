    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"' \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break, and is going on a trip to Costa Rica for 2 weeks. \nSpeaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one. \nSpeaker B dyed their hair with henna and enjoys experimenting with different hair colors, planning to touch up their hair for the summer due to sun and pool damage.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n2. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\n3. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n4. Speaker B asks if the recommended book is fiction or nonfiction.\n5. Speaker A, a retired librarian, recommends the book \"Beautiful Ruins\" by Jess Walter for a beach visit.\n6. Both Speaker A's mother and Speaker A were librarians, but Speaker A is retired.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides concise and relevant information directly related to the dialogue context. It confirms Speaker B's excitement about their trip, their plans for an adventurous spring break, and even offers a small personal detail about their hair, which could be useful for a more personal response if needed. MEMORY 2, however, includes additional details that are not directly useful or relevant for responding to the current discussion about books and travel, such as the recommendation of a book or librarian details, which have already been concluded in the dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 1"
