    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\nSpeaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car?\nSpeaker B: Yes, there are several. Hope we could meet and You possibly teach me about computer programming.\nSpeaker A: That would be great too. I like to program in several different languages. Do you have a preference? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- Speaker A recently started a new job in computer programming and offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n- Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming. \n- Speaker A has planned to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination, sparking a discussion about the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n2. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n4. Speaker A has planned to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination.\n5. Speaker A has planned a cruise to the Caribbeans.\n6. Speaker A is planning a snorkeling trip and has signed up for several trips.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains concise and relevant information that directly relates to the final question in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes Speaker A's interests and expertise in programming, which is exactly the context needed for Speaker B's question about programming languages. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, includes additional information that is not entirely relevant to the last part of the dialogue, such as Speaker A's planned snorkeling trips, which do not contribute to helping Speaker B decide on a programming language preference.\n\nChoice: 1"
