    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\nSpeaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing? \nSpeaker B: He's doing well! He just finished theatre camp and he's fighting with my sister because he wants to dye his hair green hahaha. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation. \nSpeaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one. \nSpeaker B dyed their hair with henna and enjoys experimenting with different hair colors. \nSpeaker A is getting their hair dyed turquoise by their youngest grandchild, who wants to pursue hairdressing as a profession.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation.\n3. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\n4. Speaker B has an oldest nephew who is about to turn 14.\n5. Speaker B asks if the recommended book is fiction or nonfiction.\n6. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The relevant detail in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT is the mention of Speaker B's nephew, as the conversation now has shifted from history to discussing the nephew's activities and preferences. MEMORY 2 includes specific information about Speaker B's nephew, mentioning that he is about to turn 14, which could be relevant for further discussion about his current activities and interests. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, does not contain specific information about the nephew, making it less directly useful for responding to the current topic of conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
