    "prediction": "Explanation: The focus of the dialogue context has shifted from discussing Sweden to Speaker A inquiring about Speaker B's job. Thus, the memory that provides relevant context should focus on Speaker B's personal life or activities, rather than just the shared topic of Sweden. Memory 1 contains an additional piece of context involving Speaker B's activities (playing tennis and going to church), which may be more relevant to responding about how Speaker B's job is going compared to Memory 2.\n\nChoice: 1"
