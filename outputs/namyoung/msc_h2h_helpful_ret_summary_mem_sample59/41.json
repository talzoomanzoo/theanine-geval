    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden?\nSpeaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends.\nSpeaker A: That sounds nice! So how is your job going?\nSpeaker B: Always interesting, that's for sure! I have been training to nurse on a new floor, so that'll give me a change of scenery.\nSpeaker A: Does that add a lot of extra work to your plate? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses, which causes Speaker A to consider visiting their cousin in Sweden and save money for the trip. Speaker B recommends checking out the volcanoes in Sweden for a unique experience, which they would like to do together. Speaker B grew up in Sweden and developed an interest in good coffee and chocolates, which was discussed with Speaker A.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discussed the differences between Sweden and the US, including coffee breaks.\n4. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n5. Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n6. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The current dialogue context does not indicate that Speaker B has recommended volcanoes as a must-see in Sweden. Instead, Speaker B talks about fondness for castles and beaches which aligns better with the preferences expressed in the dialogue. MEMORY 1 is not entirely consistent with the conversation and includes unnecessary details that were not mentioned. MEMORY 2 provides broader information related to both speakers' interests in Sweden and travel plans, which may be more helpful for the continuation of the conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
