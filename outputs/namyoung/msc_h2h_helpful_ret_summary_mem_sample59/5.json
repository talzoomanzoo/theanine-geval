    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet as Speaker B received a new car from their mom and plans to drive during spring break.\nSpeaker A, a retired librarian, recommends the book \"Beautiful Ruins\" by Jess Walter for a beach visit, contrasting with Speaker A's quiet spring breaks in the past.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n2. Speaker B asks if the recommended book is fiction or nonfiction.\n3. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n4. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\n5. Both Speaker A's mother and Speaker A were librarians, but Speaker A is retired.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context indicates that Speaker B is interested in learning about a book given that they asked what \"The Gettysburg Campaign\" is about after Speaker A mentioned their interest in historical fiction. MEMORY 2 is more helpful because it includes Speaker B expressing interest in whether the recommended book is fiction or nonfiction, which can directly inform Speaker A's response about the book and its genre. The additional details in MEMORY 2 about librarian backgrounds and other aspects of the relationship between Speakers A and B also provide relevant context which can help form a well-informed response. In contrast, MEMORY 1 does not include this specific interest in books and focuses more on Speaker B's trip and previous spring break activities, which are not as directly relevant to responding to Speaker B's inquiry about the book.\n\nChoice: 2"
