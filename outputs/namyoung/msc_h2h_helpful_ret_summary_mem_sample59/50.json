    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B, as a therapist, discusses the challenges and rewards of the profession. They also express concerns about the costs associated with owning horses and explore the psychological aspects of horse ownership in relation to Freudian theories. \nSpeaker B's mother being a nurse led to their career as a therapist. They express a desire to have a horse in the future and contemplate the psychological aspects of horse ownership through Freudian theories. \nSpeaker A is experienced in horse breeding and care, working at a stable and enjoying being around horses. They transition from their expertise in horses to their lack of knowledge in psychology.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist, mentioning the ups and downs of the profession.\n2. Speaker A works at a stable and enjoys being around horses.\n3. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n4. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n5. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n6. Speaker B lives in the city and is interested in having a horse in the future.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The key point in the current conversation is Speaker B's offer to help Speaker A with therapy and the discussion about completing therapy. While both memories mention the activities and interests of the speakers, MEMORY 1 mentions the successful completion of therapy and Speaker B's understanding of psychological theories. These details align directly with Speaker A's surprise about therapy having an endpoint, making MEMORY 1 more contextually relevant and helpful for the current dialogue. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, includes less relevant details like support for the Chiefs, which do not pertain to the current conversation about therapy.\n\nChoice: 1"
