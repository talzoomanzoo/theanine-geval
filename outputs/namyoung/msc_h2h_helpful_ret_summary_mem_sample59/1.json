    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker B's new car is black, and it is their first new car after driving pre-owned cars before. Speaker A is worried about gas mileage and asks about the fuel efficiency of Speaker B's car.\n2. Speaker B used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n2. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n3. Speaker A is worried about gas mileage and asks about the fuel efficiency of Speaker B's car.\n4. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\n5. Speaker B received a new car from their mom and plans to drive during spring break.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 contains the information from MEMORY 1 and additional details that do not directly relate to the current conversation about whether Speaker B has ever been to Costa Rica. However, the pertinent information—Speaker B going on a trip and not having started packing yet—is included in both, making them equally effective without additional unnecessary information. Both memories offer contextual insights, such as Speaker B's history of having quiet spring breaks contrasting with the current adventurous plan, which can facilitate a fitting reply by Speaker A.\n\nChoice: tie"
