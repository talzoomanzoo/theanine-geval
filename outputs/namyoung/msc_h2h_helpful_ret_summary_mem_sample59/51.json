    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\nSpeaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient!  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B's mom being a nurse and busy with work has influenced Speaker B to become a therapist, where they mention the ups and downs of the profession. Speaker B, living in the city, expresses a desire to have a horse in the future, considering the psychological aspects of owning one and relating it to Freudian theories. \n\nWhen Speaker B offers to discuss the absence of Speaker A's mother and suggests lying down on their couch, Speaker B, as a therapist, talks about the profession's challenges and rewards. Additionally, Speaker B reflects on the costs associated with owning horses, such as medical fees and expenses like horse shoes, and explores the psychological aspects of horse ownership in connection to Freudian theories.\n\nBeing both a therapist and a football fan supporting the Chiefs, Speaker B consistently brings up the ups and downs of the therapy profession. Furthermore, Speaker B contemplates the financial implications of horse ownership, including medical costs and expenses like horse shoes, while also delving into the psychological dimensions of owning a horse through a Freudian lens.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist, mentioning the ups and downs of the profession.\n2. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n3. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n4. Speaker A works at a stable and enjoys being around horses.\n5. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n6. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides relevant points such as Speaker A working at a stable and enjoying horses, which connects to Speaker A's mention of finding therapy in riding horses. This information is likely to be useful for Speaker A because it can facilitate a conversation about Speaker A's interest in horses and how that may relate to therapy. MEMORY 2 also notes that Speaker B has been working in their practice for about six years, which can provide credibility and context in the discussion of therapy's duration and effectiveness. MEMORY 1, while detailing Speaker B's multifaceted interests, provides additional information that is less directly relevant to the immediate dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 2"
