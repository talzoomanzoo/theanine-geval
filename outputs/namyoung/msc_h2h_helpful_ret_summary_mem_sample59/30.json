    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal.\nSpeaker B: That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab!\nSpeaker A: Oh! I did not know that. Well if you can clone cows that's more ice cream for you! Haha. What's your favorite ice cream flavor?\nSpeaker B: Yes, more ice cream is always good, haha! I like a good rocky road, or pretty much any chocolate ice cream with nuts or stir-ins! I like most of Jeni's brand too. How about you? What is your favorite kind?\nSpeaker A: I am a big fan of cookie dough ice cream, and I love cheesecake flavored ice creams too! Ben & Jerry has some that I like, but I prefer to get ice cream from an ice cream shop.  It's just something about being in that environment, \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B works at a diner at night and Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B. Speaker A had cheesy ham and potato soup for dinner. Speaker B has invented a chili dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try. \nSpeaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research. \nSpeaker B, a high school student preparing for college, works at a diner at night. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner.\n2. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n4. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n5. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n6. Speaker A had cheesy ham and potato soup for dinner.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The goal is to select the MEMORY that provides relevant and useful information for Speaker B to respond appropriately. Both memories contain similar information about Speaker B's and Speaker A's culinary preferences, Speaker B's work at a diner, and interest in neuroscience. However, they lack specific details about Speaker B's favorite ice cream flavors or any direct connection to the current topic about ice cream flavors. Given both memories hold the same level of relevance to the current stage of dialogue context, they are equally not helpful for a specific response regarding the favorite ice cream flavor. \n\nChoice: tie"
