    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot.  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country, while Speaker B is from Sweden and mentioned playing tennis and going to church on Sunday. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip, causing Speaker B to recommend checking out the volcanoes in Sweden for a unique experience.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3.

Speaker B recommends checking out the volcanoes in Sweden for a unique experience.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B discussed the differences between Sweden and the US, including coffee breaks.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains details that are both pertinent and related to the context, such as Speaker A's cousin living in Sweden, saving money for the trip, and Speaker B's recommendation regarding volcanoes. While not mentioned in the dialogue context, the information about Speaker B's love for castles aligns with their mention of Visby, which is known for its medieval architecture. On the contrary, MEMORY 2 contains extraneous information, like planning to travel together, memories from Speaker B, and discussions about cultural differences, which aren't directly useful for the immediate conversation about must-see places in Sweden.\n\nChoice: 1"
