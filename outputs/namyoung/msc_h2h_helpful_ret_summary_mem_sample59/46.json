Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B's mom is a nurse and busy with work, which led Speaker B to become a therapist, mentioning the ups and downs of the profession. Speaker B is concerned about the cost of owning horses, including medical fees and expenses like horse shoes, and is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n\nSpeaker A is involved in horse breeding and taking care of horses, working at a stable and enjoying being around horses. Speaker A mentions that horses often hurt themselves while exercising, leading to potential medical costs.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist, mentioning the ups and downs of the profession.\n2. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n3. Speaker A works at a stable and enjoys being around horses.\n4. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n5. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n6. Speaker B offers to talk about the absence of Speaker A's mother and suggests lying down on their couch.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The most relevant information to address Speaker A's statement about the challenges of being a therapist would be facts related to Speaker B's experience and perspective on being a therapist. Memory 1 contains unnecessary information about Speaker B's mother, horse costs, and Freudian theories, which are irrelevant to Speaker A's query about enjoying the profession and the difficulties involved. Memory 2, while containing some extraneous details like football, provides more pertinent information about the ups and downs of being a therapist, which could frame Speaker B's response to Speaker A's question about the enjoyment and challenges of the profession.\n\nChoice: 2"
