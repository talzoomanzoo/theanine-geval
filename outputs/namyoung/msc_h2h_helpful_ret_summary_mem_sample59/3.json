Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break, which is why Speaker B dyed their hair with henna and enjoys experimenting with different hair colors.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides specific relevant information about Speaker A being a retired librarian and recommending the book \"Beautiful Ruins\" by Jess Walter, which is directly aligned with Speaker B's inquiry about books. The rest of the details in MEMORY 1 do not directly pertain to the current conversation. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, contains superfluous information about Speaker B's packing habits, new car, and related concerns about gas mileage, which are unrelated to the immediate context of the conversation about books and travel. However, it also contains the relevant information about Speaker A recommending the book \"Beautiful Ruins.\"\n\nChoice: tie"
