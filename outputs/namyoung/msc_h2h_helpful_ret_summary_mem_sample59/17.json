    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\nSpeaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A knowing how to swim since the age of 5 has led to their plan of doing snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination. This has sparked a desire in Speaker A and Speaker B to consider getting on a cruise ship together.\nSpeaker B's enjoyment of cruising in their car while listening to punk music has inspired Speaker A to plan a cruise to the Caribbeans, changing Speaker A's travel plans for their next trip.\nSpeaker A's love for cruising and having a favorite club in school has influenced their decision to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination. This has also fueled a discussion between Speaker A and Speaker B about the possibility of going on a cruise together.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A has planned a cruise to the Caribbeans.\n2. Speaker A has planned to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n4. Speaker A plans to travel to the Caribbean for their next trip.\n5. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n6. Speaker A enjoys the food and the adventure of cruises.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The most helpful MEMORY will contain relevant details that align with the conversation context. In this dialogue, Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing travel, specifically a cruise to the Caribbean, potential activities like snorkeling, and their interests in music and programming. MEMORY 2 adequately summarizes these points, capturing the enthusiasm for punk music, travel preferences, and specific plans concerning the cruise, making it more relevant and easy for Speaker B to respond to the last utterance about local city travel. MEMORY 1, however, contains extra details and assumptions that are not directly relevant to the dialogue context, like changing travel plans, and doesn't focus as well on the necessary details for the response.\n\nChoice: 2"
