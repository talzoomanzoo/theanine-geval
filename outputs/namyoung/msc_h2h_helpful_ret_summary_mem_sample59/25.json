    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience. Speaker A offers to take Sparky for a walk to help out and spend time with the dog. Speaker A is considering getting a dog and already walks Speaker B's dog, Sparky. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n3. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n4. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n5. Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\n6. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains information about Speaker B working on weekends at a research lab, which is relevant as it aligns with the dialogue context about lab work and cloning cows. It does not contain unrelated details about hamburgers or fieldwork, which would not contribute to the conversation effectively. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, provides additional and lengthy information about Speaker B's cooking and dining habits that are not directly relevant to the immediate dialogue, potentially cluttering the conversation. The key here is focusing on the relevant lab work connection from MEMORY 1.\n\nChoice: 1"
