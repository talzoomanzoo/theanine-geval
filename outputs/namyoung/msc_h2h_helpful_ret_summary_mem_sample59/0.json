    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break. They want to go on a trip but have not started packing yet. Speaker B recently got a new blue hair color and a new Easter dress. This changed to Speaker B's new car being black, which is their first new car after driving pre-owned cars before. This change caused Speaker B to receive a new car from their mom and plan to drive during spring break. Speaker A is worried about gas mileage and asks about the fuel efficiency of Speaker B's car.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n2. Speaker A is worried about gas mileage and asks about the fuel efficiency of Speaker B's car.\n3. Speaker B received a new car from their mom and plans to drive during spring break.\n4. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n5. Speaker B's new car is black, and it is their first new car after driving pre-owned cars before.\n6. Speaker A is older and mentions having blue hair already.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 2 provides relevant pieces of information that better align with the context of responding to Speaker A's question about purchasing plane tickets. While Memory 1 contains extraneous details about Speaker B's new hair color and dress, none of these are directly relevant to the question about plane tickets. Memory 2, similarly, does not directly address the ticket issue but offers a more focused overview of the current situation involving travel plans and the new car, suggesting Speaker B might be planning to drive instead of flying, which implicitly addresses travel plans and could influence the response. \n\nChoice: 2"
