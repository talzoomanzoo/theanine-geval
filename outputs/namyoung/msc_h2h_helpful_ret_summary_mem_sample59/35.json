    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A's cousin recently moved to Sweden, which has sparked Speaker A's interest in visiting the country. This desire to visit Sweden is leading Speaker A to consider saving money by taking on a second part-time job. Additionally, Speaker B, who is from Sweden, suggested checking out the volcanoes in the country for a unique experience.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B discussed the differences between Sweden and the US, including coffee breaks.\n5. Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n6. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 is more concise and relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker A's cousin in Sweden, which is directly related to the current planning for the trip. It also notes that Speaker B has a connection to Sweden and makes a specific suggestion to check out volcanoes, which could be a new destination suggestion to help Speaker A in the planning process. This makes it much more directly useful for Speaker B to suggest or discuss potential must-see sites. MEMORY 2, while informative, includes multiple disjointed facts that do not directly assist in providing a useful or relevant response about must-see locations or suggestions.\n\nChoice: 1"
