Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?   \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B found their calling to become a therapist due to their passion for helping people and their enjoyment of listening and talking to others. This led them to start their own practice six years ago.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is focused on Speaker B's experience as a therapist and the rewarding aspects of their job. Speaker B also asks Speaker A if they have ever done therapy, suggesting an interest in further discussing therapy-related topics. MEMORY 1 contains more relevant details about Speaker B's practice as a therapist and their passion for their work, which aligns well with the ongoing conversation. The mention of Speaker B's football fandom and other unrelated details such as their potential interest in a horse while relating it to Freudian theories are less relevant. However, MEMORY 1 provides pertinent information about Speaker B's six years of practice and the rewarding nature of their work, which fits well into the dialogue. Hence, MEMORY 1 holds more helpful and context-focused information notwithstanding the extraneous details.\n\nChoice: 1"
