    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting! \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B, a high school student preparing for college, works at a diner at night but is considering giving up their job to focus on lab work and school. Additionally, Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, displaying an interest in neuroscience. Speaker A offers to take Sparky for a walk to help out and spend time with the dog, as Speaker B's dog is deaf and needs to be kept on a lead due to recall difficulties.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\n2. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n3. Speaker B is considering giving up their night job to focus on lab work and school.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the challenges and rewards of having a dog with hearing issues.\n6. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves Speaker A asking Speaker B about their plans to continue working in the lab during a cloning project, indicating an interest in Speaker B's lab work. Therefore, the relevant information should directly relate to Speaker B's involvement in lab work and their plans. MEMORY 2 provides a clear insight into Speaker B's academic focus and scheduling priorities, specifically mentioning their interest in molecular biology and the potential decision to give up their night job to concentrate on lab work. This directly applies to the context of continuing work in the lab. MEMORY 1, although it contains some overlapping information, includes additional details about their job at a diner and their dog's needs, which dilutes the focus on the lab work. Therefore, MEMORY 2 is more concise and pertinent to the dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 2"
