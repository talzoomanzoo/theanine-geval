    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\nSpeaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car?\nSpeaker B: Yes, there are several. Hope we could meet and You possibly teach me about computer programming. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- Speaker A offering to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming because Speaker A knows how to swim since the age of 5.\n- Speaker A planning to travel to the Caribbean for their next trip because Speaker B enjoys cruising in their car while listening to punk music.\n- Speaker A planning to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination because Speaker A knows how to swim since the age of 5.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n2. Speaker A has planned a cruise to the Caribbeans.\n3. Speaker A has planned to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n5. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n6. Speaker A is planning a snorkeling trip and has signed up for several trips.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 provides relevant information that directly connects with the conversation, particularly Speaker A's teaching capabilities related to swimming and programming, as well as their cruise plans to the Caribbean. Memory 2, while containing similar points, includes less relevant information about snorkeling trips and signing up for them, which does not add value to the current context of the conversation around teaching and travel interests. \n\nChoice: 1"
