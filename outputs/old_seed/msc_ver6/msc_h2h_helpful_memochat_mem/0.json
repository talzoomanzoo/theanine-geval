That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A is a high school student planning to go to college, achieving straight A's. Speaker A wants Speaker B to continue working in the lab and school instead of giving up their night job. Speaker B is also a high school student preparing for college, working at a diner at night. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Work and School Plans', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B discuss their future plans regarding school, work, and potential job opportunities.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: You bet! How's the lab work going? Are you learning anything new with the research? ### Speaker B: We just did some interesting new things on genome sequencing.  We are going to try to clone a jersey cow next year. ### Speaker A: That's intense. How much longer do you have left in school? I'm just a freshman but I'm trying to get through it all in 3 years. ### Speaker B: Just two more weeks! I'm thinking about taking classes this summer to get a head start on my freshman year at college though. ### Speaker A: I did that my first summer and recommend it, you make such a close group of friends with your classmates! And it knocks a class off your schedule, which is also nice ### Speaker B: Yes!  I may have to give up my night job though.  They have told me at the lab they would be able to give me more hours there in the fall, which will help.  Especially since i want to major in molecular biology! ### Speaker A: So what I'm hearing is that I better come get some of that casserole ASAP lol' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow?

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides detailed context on Speaker B's involvement in lab work and their future plans related to school and work. It mentions their aspirations to major in molecular biology and the possibility of giving up their night job for more hours in the lab, directly tying into the themes in the dialogue context. MEMORY 1, while providing personal details about Speaker A and B, does not closely address Speaker B's school, lab work decisions, or future academic plans, making it less relevant to Speaker B's current situation.\n\nChoice: 2"
