Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\nSpeaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach?\nSpeaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option.\nSpeaker A: Yes I think history is interesting, too! Both of those subjects would be great because there are probably lots of teaching jobs. What kind of history do you like?\nSpeaker B: I love all sorts of history. Right now I am really getting into the weeds of World War II. There's so much to unpack. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B, majoring in linguistics and aspiring to turn it into a practical job, causes Speaker A to be interested in teaching computer science, particularly in the field of robotics.\nSpeaker B, living with their mom and currently in college, wants to pursue a masters degree after finishing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. This leads Speaker B to feel limited in job opportunities but also sparks an interest in studying linguistics.\nSpeaker B, majoring in linguistics and hoping to turn it into a practical job, wants Speaker A, who is studying computer science and aims to develop apps for differently abled youth, to be interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Teaching and Career Paths', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B explore the idea of teaching and career options related to their fields.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: Yup I already volunteer at my mom's after school program.

Have you ever thought about maybe teaching at a college? ### Speaker A: Maybe community college, but it would have to courses in computer science.  I'd like to get involved with robotics. There is a lot of opportunity in this field and being able to teach it can really help advance my expertise. ### Speaker B: Yeah I feel like you could do so much with a computer science degree. It's really cool there are so many options! I feel a little bit stuck studying linguistics.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides more detailed information about Speaker B's background in linguistics, their aspiration to pursue a master's degree, and their interest in teaching on a higher education level. However, it lacks direct relevance to teaching history or World War II, which is the specific focus of the dialogue. In contrast, MEMORY 2 directly relates to both speakers considering teaching as a career option and discusses related dialogues about opportunities in teaching fields. It also links to Speaker A's interest in teaching robotics, which aligns with the dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 2"
