This fascinates Speaker A, who is fascinated by the architecture of Italy and enjoys studying history, especially through reading and watching documentaries.\nSpeaker A is planning for a spring break trip and recently bought a dress for Easter. She wants to share her love of Greek mythology with her daughter. Speaker B, on the other hand, does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology. This interest stems from Speaker B's appreciation for superhuman powers and historical events involving such figures.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Greek Mythology', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B talk about Greek mythology, specifically Poseidon and historical interest', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: Oh that's awesome. Did you major in History at school? ### Speaker A: No, but I took a history class or two before I dropped out. I read a lot about history, though, and watch a lot of documentaries on the History Channel. I guess that only place that would be better to visit to study history would be Greece.  ### Speaker B: Ah fair enough. What kind of history are you into? I really enjoy Greek mythology. I did a case study on Poseidon once. ### Speaker A: Really? I don't even know what a case study is. lol! Is that like a further in-depth study? Wasn't he God of the Sea or something like that? ### Speaker B: Yes, it is essentially a study based on a few accounts from all the way back in that time. I compiled that information and made a study on how he contributed to the aid of Zeus at the time. He is the God of the Sea, Earthquakes, and Horses. ### Speaker A: He's a busy guy! lol! I guess I haven't ever been able to get into Greek mythology because it's just that - mythology. Real historical accounts, people, and ruins have always fascinated me much more.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing?
