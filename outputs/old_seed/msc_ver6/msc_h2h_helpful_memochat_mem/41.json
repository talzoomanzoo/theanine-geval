Are you happy with it other than the price?\nSpeaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music\nSpeaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it.\nSpeaker A: I'll keep trying! Have you had any luck lately? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A values the peaceful life of working on the farm and suggests that Speaker B and their family could stay over at the farm after the concert. They also discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\nSpeaker A and Speaker B have a friendly interaction and part ways on a positive note, both having bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\nSpeaker B believes that luxurious items distract from the value of their family, while Speaker A bought 50 lotto tickets with different numbers to increase their chances of winning.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Lotto Tickets and Winning Strategy', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B talk about buying lotto tickets and share different strategies for increasing chances of winning.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: I see that the lotto is big this week. Have you bought a ticket yet? This could be your chance. ### Speaker B: Yes, I bought 20 tickets when I saw how big the jackpot had gotten.  I don't think it's possible that I lose! ### Speaker A: Nice! I bought some too. 50 to be exact! My family thinks it's dumb of me to buy so many lol but hey it's worth a shot. ### Speaker B: You can't win if you don't play.  I know that for sure.  Hey, I had a really crazy idea and wanted to hear what you thought about it. ### Speaker A: Exactly! Yeah for sure, what's the crazy idea?? I'm very intrigued. ### Speaker B: So you know how when a jackpot is won by multiple people, they split it evenly with each winner?  So if the prize is $100 million and four people get the winning numbers, each person gets 25% of the jackpot?  Well think about this.  If I bought 20 tickets, all with the same numbers, and won the jackpot with three other people, instead of getting 25% of the jackpot, I'd get 20/23rds of the jackpot instead!  So that's what I did! ### Speaker A: LOL but now you only have one chance of winning! I did different numbers for all of my 50 tickets so I have 50 chances. ### Speaker B: Yeah, both strategies have their pros and cons.  But if I win I want it to be on the news.  They'll say, \"There were 23 winners of the jackpot.\"  And then people will think, \"Well that's lame.  Each person takes home such a tiny amount.\"  But then they'll say, \"One insanely brilliant person had 20 winning tickets and is therefore getting the bulk of the jackpot.\"' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive. ###Speaker B: Oh I see.
