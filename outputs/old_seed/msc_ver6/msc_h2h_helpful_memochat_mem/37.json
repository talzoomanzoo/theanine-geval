The purple looked so good in store though lol. Do you think I should repaint to match? ### Speaker A: Depends on the color. Dark royal purple would look ok with like blood red or some other dark color. Green and purple could go together if you find a way to get the shades right and marry them. Idk. I am not an interior decorator though am I. Maybe I am actually clueless lol. ### Speaker B: Yeah, its not a dark green. More of a pastel. It sounds like we are both clueless. I might just leave it and claim I am colour blind.  ### Speaker A: Or you could add a few random splashes of like neon pink and lavender to the wall. Get some outlandish curtains and hang up a bead door to the room and call it the chill room where colors mesh and collide to make an inspiring hippy feel. Idk ### Speaker B: I like the way you are thinking. Want to come over and splash some colour all over the place? ### Speaker A: Ohhh yes! I would love to do that. Maybe you could even get some on the couches or on the wood furniture just for fun. Or instead of the couches, get some throw pillows and splash on them! ### Speaker B: Awesome, I think we may have found a solution.
