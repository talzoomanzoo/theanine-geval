Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \nSpeaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along!\nSpeaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them.\nSpeaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me!\nSpeaker A: Hahaha. Yes I agree its too hot to get a long hike in. I've been on some short ones, but the bugs eat me alive. I like to hike in the fall when the bugs are dying off and its a little cooler.\nSpeaker B: Ah yes, that's my favorite time of year. Oh and speaking of Tasha, I'm still amazed she knows Mandarin. Have you been learning more of the language? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B has two sick kitties and recently received a rescue, which causes Speaker A to have a parrot named Tasha and be interested in adopting a rescue kitten. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Adopting Kittens and Training Pets', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker B talks about adopting out a rescue kitten, and Speaker A discusses adopting a kitten and training it to get along with the parrot.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: Do you still want to adopt out your new resucue kitten? ### Speaker B: Yes, I have just finished filling out and submitting all of the adoption paperwork to the animal rescue. And good news, all kittens are feeling better and are healthy again. I love them. ### Speaker A: That's great news! Do you have any names picked out for them or are you going to keep their names? ### Speaker B: I do not have any names picked out for them yet. I have been trying to get to know their personalities better before I give them a name. Two of them are very spunky and one is shy. Maybe I will give them a Mandarin name! Do you have any recommendations as you are learning Mandarin? ### Speaker A: Hm, maybe Zhao for one of them! I always thought that name sounded cool ### Speaker B: Oh, how interesting! I have a friend who's surname is Zhao. What does Zhao mean in Mandarin? ### Speaker A: I believe it's just the name of a state, it doesn't really have a meaning.  ### Speaker B: Oh, okay. Are you able to adopt any cats since you have a parrot? I do not know if those two species get along. ### Speaker A: I can! My parrot would be fine with the extra friend, I would just need to train the kitten to see him as a friend rather than a foe, ha! ### Speaker B: I will pass on any training tips that I acquire as I train the new kittens. My older cat is so mellow that I have never had any issues training her. But two on the little kittens seem like they will be a handful to train.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 does not provide detailed information about the Mandarin language or learning it, which is the current topic of the dialogue context. MEMORY 2, however, offers relevant details about Mandarin, including Speaker B's interest in potentially naming the kittens with Mandarin names and mentions Speaker A learning Mandarin. This information is directly connected to the last line of the dialogue context where Speaker B asks about learning more Mandarin. Therefore, MEMORY 2 is more helpful in providing a relevant context to the current conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
