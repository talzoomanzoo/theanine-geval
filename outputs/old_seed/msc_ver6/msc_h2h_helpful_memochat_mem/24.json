It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume.\nSpeaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment. \nSpeaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think?\nSpeaker A: It depends on what you are trying to make out of origami, you can make some super complicated stuff, there's actually special paper that you can get for it! You may have seen origami be used in the hospital for some breathing aperatus!\nSpeaker B: That's amazing. I had no idea, but that totally makes sense. Do you have to practice a lot -- sort of a use it or lose it kind of thing?\nSpeaker A: Yea, I think for the more complicated origami it's kind of a use it or lose it but for the simple stuff you can usually take a couple months of and still remember to do it! Did you see origami in Japan?\nSpeaker B: Not up close, but I noticed a lot in shop windows in certain areas. I love Japan -- they're so welcoming. One of our acquaintances GAVE me a kimono. She said it's customary to try to share their culture. Kind of different from America in my opinion.  \nSpeaker A: Oh, that sounds wonderful. It's impressive how much things that came from there and how giving a culture they are. America is definetly a lot different from them, have you visted different states in America? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both like the color turquoise. Speaker B keeps a turquoise lotus origami on their desk from Japan, which causes Speaker A to wish to visit the country where origami was originally created, possibly Japan.\nSpeaker B has visited 20 countries and enjoys the color turquoise, reacting positively to having visited Japan and finding it to be an amazing country.\nSpeaker A, who had a fortunate upbringing and enjoys helping people through volunteer work, caused Speaker B to be recommended volunteering and travel to Japan and Italy, enjoying the art and food. This makes Speaker A want to visit Italy first before going to Japan.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'origami discussion', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B discuss origami, sharing experiences and plans to try it together.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: I tried the origami Lotus that you suggested.

I wish I could visit where they were originally created. ### Speaker B: Oh, nice. Do you mean you want to go to Japan? What's stopping you? ### Speaker A: Well my first plan is to go to italy, did you have any trouble with japans customs? ### Speaker B: I didn't have much trouble, but the visa wasn't cheap. Still, I think it was worth it. Japan is an amazing country with a lot to offer. ### Speaker A: When are you going to try origami? I could teach you. ### Speaker B: In a few weeks I'll have more time. Maybe we could try then. What's the easiest thing to start with? ### Speaker A: Well something like a cup is super easy, other things require cutting the paper.I haven't tried that many, but we can try some together ### Speaker B: That sounds like a great idea. I would really like to make origami animals. It think it'd be cute. Are those hard to make? ### Speaker A: Well it depend on if you're talking about just their heads or if you want to make their whole body, I think the heads are easier. ### Speaker B: I would prefer to make their whole bodies, just a head seems a bit weird. Do you think it'd be too advanced for me?' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!!
