I have always wanted a cockatoo, but I've always been afraid that they would keep me awake at night or something while I am trying to sleep. Does hers make a lot of noise? ### Speaker B: Oh yeah you bet haha. Making sure the environment is really quiet helps them to calm though. Does your sister like animals too? ### Speaker A: Yeah, she is definitely a dog person. She has a yellow lab and they are best buds. ### Speaker B: Haha nice. I always thought about getting a dog, but cats are just so much easier. I'm thinking about getting another cat sometime next month actually. ### Speaker A: I was talking to a friend three days ago, and they mentioned they are giving away kittens that their cat just gave birth to. You should give them a call, and ask to adopt one. I am sure they would be happy to give you a kitten, given how well you take care of your cat. ### Speaker B: Oh my goodness that's so exciting! Yes I'll definitely give them a call, at least just to talk about it and see whether one of the kittens would be right for me. Would you consider getting one too?' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens? ### \n\n``` Speaker A Input:\nRecent Dialogs: Speaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens? ### \n\n``` Speaker A Input:\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
