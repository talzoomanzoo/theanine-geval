    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides more contextual details about Speaker B's interest in visiting zoos and their relationship with animals, such as owning a cat that recently had a kitten, which relates directly to Speaker A's initial question about kittens. It mentions Zoo visits and specific animals both speakers like to see, which can be helpful to elaborate on their discussion about the San Diego zoo in the Dialogue Context. This MEMORY provides Speaker B with specific information about Speaker A's preferences and experiences, which can enrich the conversation. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 is more general and does not connect as clearly with the ongoing conversation about San Diego and the zoo visit.\n\nChoice: 1"
