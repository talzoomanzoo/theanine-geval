I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week?\nSpeaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day\nSpeaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through\nSpeaker A: Actually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to it. Do you think I will need to rent a car when I'm there, or is it possible to walk and bike in the summer? I always picture huge amounts of snow but I'm not sure if it's like that all year round.\nSpeaker A: I would definitely recommend looking for a rental car to have on hand. There is a town within walking distance from me, but it can be dangerous to walk with the wolves and elk around, especially at night.\nSpeaker B: I imagine so!!! I wouldn't want to run into a wolf! Ok. I will add car rental to my plans. Do you get scared with your dogs, that you will run into wildilfe like that?\nSpeaker A: I think I'm more afraid of the wildlife than my dogs are. If I had to, I think I could muster the courage to face the animals out here, but I will happily avoid them when possible. With you around, I'd feel much better, as well. How do you feel about being that close to wildlife? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A, who has blue eyes and blonde hair, invited Speaker B to visit and mentioned looking into flights, which causes Speaker B to plan to visit Speaker A and be interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n\nSpeaker B enjoys warm days, cool mornings, and eating poached eggs, and Speaker A mentions the \"midnight sun\" phenomenon in Alaska where the sun does not set during the summer. Speaker A also talks about wildlife, including elk and wolves, which causes Speaker A to make poached eggs for breakfast and take sleds pulled by dogs.\n\nSpeaker A drives a smart car and used to have a long commute in Alaska, and suggests going on hikes in Alaska to see wildlife and mentions glaciers as a potential attraction, while Speaker B is planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Visiting Alaska', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker B confirms finding suitable flights to visit Alaska and plans to attend a concert while there.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: Wow, sign me up!

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more helpful because it directly relates to the conversation about visiting, planning a concert, and considering wildlife encounters in Alaska. It provides relevant information about past discussions on these topics, enhancing Speaker B's understanding and context of the visit plans. MEMORY 1, while containing relevant details, includes additional information that is not as closely tied to the immediate context of the conversation, such as personal preferences and unrelated activities.\n\nChoice: 2"
