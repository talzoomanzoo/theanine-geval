I have always wanted a cockatoo, but I've always been afraid that they would keep me awake at night or something while I am trying to sleep. Does hers make a lot of noise? ### Speaker B: Oh yeah you bet haha. Making sure the environment is really quiet helps them to calm though. Does your sister like animals too? ### Speaker A: Yeah, she is definitely a dog person. She has a yellow lab and they are best buds. ### Speaker B: Haha nice. I always thought about getting a dog, but cats are just so much easier. I'm thinking about getting another cat sometime next month actually. ### Speaker A: I was talking to a friend three days ago, and they mentioned they are giving away kittens that their cat just gave birth to. You should give them a call, and ask to adopt one. I am sure they would be happy to give you a kitten, given how well you take care of your cat. ### Speaker B: Oh my goodness that's so exciting! Yes I'll definitely give them a call, at least just to talk about it and see whether one of the kittens would be right for me. Would you consider getting one too?' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens? ###Speaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month ### \n\n``` Speaker B Input:\nRecent Dialogs: Speaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens? ###Speaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month ### \n\n``` Speaker B Input:\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides information that aligns directly with the topic of the dialogue context, which is about deciding to get a kitten. It mentions that Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from Speaker A's friend, making it highly relevant to the ongoing conversation. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, provides related topics and past dialogues about pets but doesn't directly relate to the specific situation discussed in the Dialogue Context. Therefore, MEMORY 1 is more helpful because it directly addresses the subject matter Speaker A is inquiring about.\n\nChoice: 1"
