How about you?\nSpeaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions?\nSpeaker B: Unfortunately I mainly play games similar to RE. I don't know why I like them so much. I remember when I was little my brother play Doom and it gave me nightmares for a week. What genre of games you like?\nSpeaker A: I like all kinds of games. I like party, fighting, RPGs, shooters, action, adventure, and puzzle games. I enjoy playing Jurassic Park: World but I'd like to find another game to play. The storm means I'll be inside for a bit, so I think I'll curl up with some pizza and just zone out. Do you like to do anything else besides game when it's rainy?\nSpeaker B: Well, I might help around the house with cleaning or laundry, but not that much. Mostly gaming.

I really liked the last one so I'm eager to see if this one is as good. ### Speaker A: Hmm, that could be interesting.  Do you play by yourself or is it a multiplayer online game? ### Speaker B: I just play it by myself.  I turn the lights out and play it late at night by myself so it's as scary as possible.  Do you like horror movies and scary things like that? ### Speaker A: Not really. About the only thing scary that I like is sneaking up on a deer out in the wild!  I play videogames every now and then but they are usually tame, calm ones.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week? ###Speaker B: I sure did.
