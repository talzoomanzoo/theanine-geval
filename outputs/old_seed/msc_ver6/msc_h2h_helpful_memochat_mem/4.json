It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip? \nSpeaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery\nSpeaker B: Yes I think that's a great idea, how is work at the library? \nSpeaker A: Busy, and demanding because we are short staffed.

How is your family doing these days?\nSpeaker B: Well I would be happy to help. My family are all great thank you for asking I took the grandkids to the park again we had a great time. How's your family doing?  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B, having a lot of kids who are now grown up and have kids of their own, causes Speaker A to be busy with work and unable to spend as much time with their own kids as they would like. Speaker B, in contrast, wants to spend time with their grandkids at the park and enjoys it. This causes Speaker B to like the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature. Additionally, Speaker A has children and grandchildren, with at least one child interested in learning the flute.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Family and Kids', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B discuss their family and kids, including spending time with grandkids and children's interests.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: Hello there, how was your day? ### Speaker B: Hello. Today was a good day since I got to play with my son's kids. You? ### Speaker A: I love kid too, but I dont have much time with them am a librarian. ### Speaker B: That is interesting. My mother also had the same profession as you. ### Speaker A: Thats cool I have 3 children does your mother has the same thing? ### Speaker B: No but I had a lot of kids.. ### Speaker A: Are they up to nine my is below the age of nine. ### Speaker B: They are all grown up now and have kids of their own. ### Speaker A: Really, how do they go to work everyday is it by boat like me? ### Speaker B: Most of them take the subway. What do you do? ### Speaker A: I love playing flute but that is not what I do for living. ### Speaker B: Do you play in a band or symphony? ### Speaker A: Get to spend more time with your son and grandkids? ### Speaker B: I did it was a great time, we went to the park! ### Speaker A: That is always a great way to spend time with kids. ### Speaker B: Most definitely, for sure the moments I cherish in life. Have  you got to spend time with your kids? ### Speaker A: Work has kept me away from them more than I would like, unfortunately.  ### Speaker B: That is unfortunate but I know how that goes. My mom was a libraian, so she was always busy helping people ### Speaker A: It is a taxing job, but very rewarding. ### Speaker B: Most definitely, I think the rewards ulitmately make it worth it, plus your kids can get any book they want! ### Speaker A: That is a huge perk! Kids don't read enough these days.  ### Speaker B: I know! I feel like most kids would struggle even finding a book in a library, internet has made it easy for them! ### Speaker A: No kidding. Things sure have changed over the years. ### Speaker B: I know! I can't remember the last time my grandkids asked to go to the libary. ### Speaker A: Have you ever thought about taking your grandkids to a library and explaining what your mom did for a living as a librarian? It could be a great learning field trip for them.  ### Speaker B: Kids just don't seem to be interested in going to the library anymore. ### Speaker A: I agree, I see libraries closing more and more. Even school libraries are half the size they use to be. ### Speaker B: I'm not really sure of a solution to keep libraries open. With the rise of the internet people do not need them as much as I used to. ### Speaker A: That is basically it. Everything is becoming electronic. Paper books are not really needed, only people who cherish a real book keep them relevant. ### Speaker B: I do find it interesting that libraries now are finding creative ways to still stay relevant like creating little maker spaces.  Some are adding 3D printers and other tools to keep kids learning and entertained in a safe environment ### Speaker A: Yes we implement those in our library. We still get parents bringing in their little kids which I find encouraging ### Speaker B: Not only will the kids learn but the parents will also learn new skills to ### Speaker A: even librarians like me learn new skills too, lol ### Speaker B: That's true you're never too old to learn a new skill ### Speaker A: :), so how was the trip to the park with your grandkids? ### Speaker B: It was great the weather was really nice and I really enjoyed getting outside and getting some fresh air ### Speaker A: My youngest child just asked me if I could teach them how to play the flute! ### Speaker B: Oh really? So they want to play the flute like you. That's wonderful to hear. Are you planning to teach them yourself or hire a teacher? ### Speaker A: I am going to teach them myself. I am just so proud that they came to me and asked for my help. It was nice to feel wanted by my kids.  ### Speaker B: I bet is a wonderful feeling. I took my grandkids fishing once because they asked me to. It's a great way to bond with them. Now you and your youngest can bond through music. I think that's wonderful. ### Speaker A: Yes, I am so glad we can spend some time together and bond over flutes. She wants to learn because of the singer Lizzo. She can play the flute so well that it inspired her. Have you heard of her? ### Speaker B: Ah no I have not. I'm sure one of my grandkids have. Are they very famous? I'm a bit out of touch with music these days. ### Speaker A: Yes she is famous. Me too. I am a bit out of touch too with the latest music. My daughter played the video of her playing the flute and singing. It was incredible. I am glad she found a motivation though. Can any of your kids play an instrument? ### Speaker B: No not my kids or grandkids. They spend so much time on their phones and tablets that they rarely take interest in such things. It would be wonderful if one of them did take an interest in music. Is your youngest the only one interested in musical intrustments right now? ### Speaker A: Yes at the moment. My other two are just like yours - addicted to tablets and phones. I hoping that when I start teaching my youngest the flute the others would want to join in. I will grab a few spare just in case. Did you ever take your kids fishing? Did they like it? ### Speaker B: They sure did. Even though the oldest girl was so busy with her texting and what not. The other grandkids loved it and even caught a good sized fish! I really hope they'll let me take them again one day.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids? ###Speaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call! ###Speaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 directly relates to the conversation context by including specific mention of Speaker A's challenges with work keeping them from family, which is directly relevant to Speaker B's inquiry about Speaker A's family. It also hints at Speaker B's preference for spending time with their grandchildren over engaging with technology, which aligns with the dialogue context. MEMORY 2 contains a broader dialogue that includes relevant points about libraries and family but is more generalized and less specific to the immediate topic of the conversation context.\n\nChoice: 1"
