    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot.  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country, while Speaker B is from Sweden and mentioned playing tennis and going to church on Sunday. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip, causing Speaker B to recommend checking out the volcanoes in Sweden for a unique experience.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n4. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n5. Speaker B recommends checking out the volcanoes in Sweden for a unique experience.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B discussed the differences between Sweden and the US, including coffee breaks.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: In the dialogue context, Speaker A is planning a trip to Sweden and is interested in must-see spots. Speaker B responds with a personal favorite, Visby, and mentions loving the castles. For Speaker A to respond appropriately, information about recommended places to visit or Speaker B's knowledge about Sweden would be most helpful.\n\nChoice: 2\n\nMemory 2 provides a broader context of Speaker B's fondness for Sweden and that they have discussed differences between Sweden and the US. This makes Memory 2 slightly more helpful as it gives Speaker A additional insights into Speaker B's experiences and preferences that they could relate to the must-see suggestions or ask further questions about. Memory 1 has some relevant information (e.g., the volcano suggestion), but not as much broader context as Memory 2."
