Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\nSpeaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\nSpeaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\nSpeaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.\nSpeaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A used to help their father on a farm in the past, which instilled a strong work ethic in them.

Adjusting to a new environment has been challenging but exciting for Speaker A. They are looking forward to exploring the opportunities this city has to offer and reconnecting with their siblings. \nSpeaker B's father was involved in producing horror movies, which sparked Speaker B's interest in the genre.
