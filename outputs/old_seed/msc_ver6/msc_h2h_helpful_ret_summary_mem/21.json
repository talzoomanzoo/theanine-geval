    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \nSpeaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A enjoys cooking and baking, possibly considering turning it into a business. Speaker A primarily cooks Indian food and bakes a lot of rice dishes. Speaker A owns a farm and enjoys cooking and baking. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\nSpeaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work. Speaker B's husband is a great cook and Speaker B is not skilled in cooking. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker. Speaker B also mentions having a farm with animals like chickens, ducks, pigs, goats, and growing crops like corn, strawberries, and pumpkins.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work.\n2. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker.\n3. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n4. Speaker A recommends the pressure cooker for its efficiency and ease of use, suggesting it to Speaker B.\n5. Speaker A has given a pressure cooker as a gift and uses it for recipes like lamb shanks.\n6. Speaker A primarily cooks Indian food and bakes a lot of rice dishes.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context indicates that Speaker B is looking for a recipe suggestion to start with, especially potentially an Asian one, and that the process might involve using a pressure cooker. Therefore, helpful information would include recollections of preferences and skills related to Asian cooking, using a pressure cooker, and specific recipes that could be suggested.\n\nChoice: 2\n\nMEMORY 2 provides relevant information about Speaker B's interest in learning to cook with a pressure cooker and Speaker A's pressure cooker recommendations. This context makes it easier for Speaker A to suggest a specific recipe since they have already recommended the appliance's ease and suggested using it for certain dishes. Hence, it seems more helpful for responding to which recipe to start with."
