Memory 1 provides specific details about Speaker A's exhaustion from watching grandchildren and their interests, including reading books. This information helps address the question about whether the book was exciting. In Memory 2, the details are more general and less focused on Speaker A's interests, making it less directly helpful in responding to the question about the book. \n\nChoice: 1"
