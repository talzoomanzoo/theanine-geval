    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons\nSpeaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use.\nSpeaker B: I am a little scared of needles though. Were your tattoos painful?\nSpeaker A: Most of them were not.  It really depends on where on your body you get them.  Most of mine are on areas that didn't hurt.  The one on my foot and the one behind my ear did hurt a good bit.  Where were you thinking about getting it?\nSpeaker B: I hadn't really thought about it! Maybe upper arm or upper back? But I'm no tattoo expert. And I'd have to get permission from my wife first, LOL\nSpeaker A: Definitely talk to her first.  I had a friend that didn't talk to his wife and just came home with a tattoo one day.  It led to a huge fight - both about the money he spent and not discussing it with her.  He slept on my couch for over a week!\nSpeaker B: Oh no! Yeah, you don't want to spring something like that on your spouse. I don't think you mentioned before, are you married?\nSpeaker A: No.  I haven't found anyone that could deal with me or that I could deal with for more than a few months.  At this point, I have given up on the idea of getting married and want to focus on my artwork.\nSpeaker B: There's nothing wrong with being on your own. You've got to focus on meeting your own needs first. Have you done any interesting art/graffiti lately?\nSpeaker A: I probably shouldn't be saying this, but I put up a large mural on the side of the local Community Center.  People seem to like it - at least everyone except the administrators of the center.  Everyone is trying to figure out who did it.   \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest. They enjoy getting tattoos and have 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father. They work at a coffee shop and are saving up for their next tattoo. Their favorite tattoo is the one dedicated to their late father, saying \"for you I shall live.\"\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father.\n2. Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\n3. Speaker A's favorite tattoo is the one dedicated to their late father, saying \"for you I shall live\".\n4. Speaker A works at a coffee shop and is saving up for their next tattoo.\n5. Speaker A loves the show Friends and enjoys visiting graffiti-filled places.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B have a conversation about their personal interests and trips they have taken for work.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The information contained in both memories revolves around Speaker A's tattoos, which is relevant given the current topic of tattoos in the dialogue. However, MEMORY 2 includes additional relevant details about Speaker A's appreciation for graffiti and visiting graffiti-filled places, which could relate to the interesting art piece they mentioned having created at the Community Center. This makes MEMORY 2 more comprehensive and potentially more helpful in context than MEMORY 1.\n\nChoice: 2"
