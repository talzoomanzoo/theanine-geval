    "prediction": "Explanation: In the Dialogue Context, Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from Speaker A's friend, but needs to wait until after their vacation. Useful information would be details about past related decisions on kittens or priorities that might conflict. MEMORY 2 directly states that Speaker A prefers cockatoos over kittens (which contrasts with the consideration) and indicates Speaker B's existing connection to cats. These details are relevant and directly pertain to the decision about the kitten. MEMORY 1 mentions considerations of adopting a kitten but doesn’t provide any new insights or context beyond what’s already in the dialogue, thus offering less added value.\n\nChoice: 2"
