Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon?\nSpeaker A: Yes!  As a matter of fact, I'm visiting my son that lives in Spain next month.  This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now!\nSpeaker B: Oh nice. You must be looking forward to it. He must have told you a lot about her. Do you think you would like her?\nSpeaker A: I think so.  She seems like a very sweet girl and she seems to care deeply about my son, so that's what matters most.  You know, maybe I can stop by and visit you as well, since you live in Europe.  France, Spain, Italy?  Where are you living now? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A's sons have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next. They will be coming for winter break from Europe. \nSpeaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite worrying about them traveling far away. Speaker A's sons play video games and listen to music in their rooms.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A has two sons who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next.\n2. Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe.\n3. Speaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite worrying about them traveling far away.\n4. Speaker B's younger son would be jealous of Speaker A's sons' European tour.\n5. Speaker A has multiple sons, at least one of them is in a relationship with a Spanish girlfriend.\n6. Speaker B has two sons, one who loves Chinese food like Speaker A, and the other who prefers Italian food.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about potentially visiting Speaker B and determining where they currently live. MEMORY 2 contains information pertaining to the sons of both Speaker A and Speaker B, including Speaker B's sons and their preferences, which may help build a connection. However, neither MEMORY 1 nor MEMORY 2 directly addresses Speaker B's current location. MEMORY 2 has more relevant information overall about Speaker A's son's relationship, which aligns with the conversation's direction, making it slightly more helpful for further discussion.\n\nChoice: 2"
