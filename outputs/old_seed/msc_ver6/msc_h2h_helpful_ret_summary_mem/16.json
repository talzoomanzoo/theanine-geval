    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet? \nSpeaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name?\nSpeaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \nSpeaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along!\nSpeaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them.\nSpeaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me!\nSpeaker A: Hahaha. Yes I agree its too hot to get a long hike in. I've been on some short ones, but the bugs eat me alive. I like to hike in the fall when the bugs are dying off and its a little cooler.\nSpeaker B: Ah yes, that's my favorite time of year. Oh and speaking of Tasha, I'm still amazed she knows Mandarin. Have you been learning more of the language? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B has two sick kitties and recently received a rescue, which causes Speaker A to have a parrot named Tasha and be interested in adopting a rescue kitten. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n2. Speaker A has a pet named Tasha who speaks Mandarin.\n3. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n4. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n5. Speaker A is interested in training tips for the kittens and is open to adopting one despite having a parrot.\n6. Speaker A's parrot Tasha has seen cats before and ignores them.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The context is discussing Tasha, Speaker A's parrot, who knows Mandarin, and the interest in adopting rescue kittens. MEMORY 2 directly mentions that Tasha speaks Mandarin, which is highly relevant to Speaker B's question about Speaker A learning more of the language. MEMORY 1 provides context on the rescue kittens and Mandarin names but does not mention Tasha's language abilities.\n\nChoice: 2"
