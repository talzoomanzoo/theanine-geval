Speaker A has a sister who owns a corgi.\n6. Speaker B's girlfriend has a cockatoo that makes a lot of noise.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Speaker A asked if Speaker B decided to get one of their friend's kittens. MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 both mention that Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten, which directly relates to Speaker A's question. However, MEMORY 1 contains less extraneous information and focuses more on the context of getting a kitten from a friend, which aligns perfectly with the question. MEMORY 2, while also containing this relevant information, is cluttered with additional unrelated details, making it less efficient for forming a response.\n\nChoice: 1"
