    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories mention Speaker A's interest in cooking and that Speaker B values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe. However, MEMORY 1 includes the detail that garlic chicken always reminds Speaker B of the good old days, a sentiment mentioned in the dialogue. MEMORY 1 also relates directly to Speaker B's nostalgia and the notion of family gatherings, which offers more depth and relevance to the dialogue context, especially considering Speaker B's invitation to Speaker A to try the spicy fried rice. This makes MEMORY 1 more helpful as it provides context for Speaker B's emotional connection to the dishes and their love for cooking for others, which could be used to engage further in the conversation related to the \"good old days.\"\n\nChoice: 1"
