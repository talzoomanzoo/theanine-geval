    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know. \nSpeaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A enjoys going to bars and loves the ladies. They also like Mexican food and women. \nSpeaker B's wife is pregnant and currently in the second trimester, still working. They are considering attending a local festival for just a day. \nSpeaker A is not sure if they will ever settle down with a partner and have kids. \nSpeaker B, a mechanic, is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy. They discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n2. Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n4. Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy.\n5. Speaker A frequents live band venues and plays music at home.\n6. Speaker B agrees to look at Speaker A's Subaru Legacy for the funny noise it makes.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 offers a concise collection of points that are more focused and relevant to the current situation presented in the dialogue context. It highlights both speakers' interests in bluegrass music, which aligns with the Bluegrass show being discussed. It also mentions Speaker B's wife's pregnancy, which is relevant to her comfort and the potential use of the cabin. While MEMORY 1 provides some useful information about the pregnancy and logistics of attending festivals, other details about Speaker A's interest in bars and settling down are less related to the immediate context. Therefore, MEMORY 2 provides a better foundation for a focused response to the offer of the cabin stay.\n\nChoice: 2"
