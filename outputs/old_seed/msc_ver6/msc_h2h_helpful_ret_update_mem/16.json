    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet? \nSpeaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name?\nSpeaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \nSpeaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along!\nSpeaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them.\nSpeaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me!\nSpeaker A: Hahaha. Yes I agree its too hot to get a long hike in. I've been on some short ones, but the bugs eat me alive. I like to hike in the fall when the bugs are dying off and its a little cooler.\nSpeaker B: Ah yes, that's my favorite time of year. Oh and speaking of Tasha, I'm still amazed she knows Mandarin. Have you been learning more of the language? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B has two sick kitties and recently received a rescue, which causes Speaker A to have a parrot named Tasha and be interested in adopting a rescue kitten. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n2. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n3. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n4. Speaker A's parrot Tasha has seen cats before and ignores them.\n5. Speaker A is interested in training tips for the kittens and is open to adopting one despite having a parrot.\n6. Speaker A suggested the name Zhao for one of the kittens.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides relevant background on both Speaker A's interest in adopting kittens and Speaker A's parrot, Tasha, who knows Mandarin, which ties directly into Speaker B's last question about Speaker A learning more of the language. This connection makes MEMORY 1 more pertinent to the current dialogue as it directly references Mandarin, providing a logical link to the present conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
