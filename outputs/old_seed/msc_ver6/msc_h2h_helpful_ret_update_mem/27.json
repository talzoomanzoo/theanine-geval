    "prediction": "Explanation: When determining the most helpful memory, we need to focus on the information that directly relates to the possibility of Speaker B adopting a friend's kitten and any potential concerns due to their upcoming vacation. Memory 1 mentions Speaker B considering adopting a kitten and their interest in a zoo, but also has extraneous information about Speaker B's girlfriend, which is less relevant. Memory 2 succinctly captures that Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten and adds relevant, though not directly related, details about Speaker B's interests and Speaker A's pet preferences. Memory 2's simple statement (1) directly addressing the adoption consideration is the most essential point for the context.\n\nChoice: 2"
