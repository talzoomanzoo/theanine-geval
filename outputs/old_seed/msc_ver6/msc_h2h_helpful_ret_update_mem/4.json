    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\nSpeaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call!\nSpeaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip? \nSpeaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery\nSpeaker B: Yes I think that's a great idea, how is work at the library? \nSpeaker A: Busy, and demanding because we are short staffed. While there seems to be little need for a library these days, I find that we have less staff to get everything done\nSpeaker B: Well if you ever need someone to come and help for a couple of hours here and there, give me a call, you know how much I love to be in the library anyway\nSpeaker A: I will keep that in mind as we do have volunteer hours available. How is your family doing these days?\nSpeaker B: Well I would be happy to help. My family are all great thank you for asking I took the grandkids to the park again we had a great time. How's your family doing?  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B, having a lot of kids who are now grown up and have kids of their own, causes Speaker A to be busy with work and unable to spend as much time with their own kids as they would like. Speaker B, in contrast, wants to spend time with their grandkids at the park and enjoys it. This causes Speaker B to like the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature. Additionally, Speaker A has children and grandchildren, with at least one child interested in learning the flute.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n2. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n3. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n4. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n5. Speaker A sees parents bringing in their little kids to the library as encouraging.\n6. Speaker B mentions having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 provides more context about Speaker A's family, such as having children and grandchildren and an interest from one in learning the flute. However, it lacks details on Speaker B's grandkids' mixed reactions to fishing, which is more immediately relevant to a potential annual fishing trip mentioned in the dialogue. Memory 2 is more directly helpful to the conversation as it mentions both Speaker B's positive experience at the park with their grandkids and the mixed reactions they experienced during a fishing trip. This is useful for Speaker A in understanding the context of both the ongoing discussion about family and leisure activities, and the specifics of planning a fishing trip.\n\nChoice: 2"
