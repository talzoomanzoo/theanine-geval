Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon?\nSpeaker A: Yes!  As a matter of fact, I'm visiting my son that lives in Spain next month.  This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now! \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A's boys have been out of town for a while and are leaving again in a few months, but Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe. \nSpeaker A enjoys different cuisines like Mexican, Italian, and Chinese, and her two sons have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next, which causes Speaker A's son and his girlfriend to study to be chefs in college.\nSpeaker A's sons play video games and listen to music in their rooms, and Speaker A's youngest son is addicted to social media and video games.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A has two sons who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next.\n2. Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe.\n3. Speaker B's younger son would be jealous of Speaker A's sons' European tour.\n4. Speaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite worrying about them traveling far away.\n5. Speaker B is good at ice skating and suggests going to an ice skating rink during winter break.\n6. Speaker B has two sons, one of whom has had a girlfriend for several years and the other is secretive.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 gives specifics about Speaker A's sons being in Europe for study reasons and details about Speaker A's cooking preferences and their sons' interests, but it doesn't directly address the immediate context of Speaker A meeting her son's girlfriend in Spain. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, provides relevant information about Speaker A's sons studying abroad in Spain (where Speaker A plans to visit) and mentions Speaker B's suggestion of ice skating during winter break, which is consistent with the recent dialogue on the topic of ice skating. MEMORY 2 also notes that Speaker B's younger son might be jealous of such travels, which ties into the broader context of European travel.\n\nChoice: 2"
