    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\nSpeaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach?\nSpeaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option.\nSpeaker A: Yes I think history is interesting, too! Both of those subjects would be great because there are probably lots of teaching jobs. What kind of history do you like?\nSpeaker B: I love all sorts of history. Right now I am really getting into the weeds of World War II. There's so much to unpack. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B, majoring in linguistics and aspiring to turn it into a practical job, causes Speaker A to be interested in teaching computer science, particularly in the field of robotics.\nSpeaker B, living with their mom and currently in college, wants to pursue a masters degree after finishing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. This leads Speaker B to feel limited in job opportunities but also sparks an interest in studying linguistics.\nSpeaker B, majoring in linguistics and hoping to turn it into a practical job, wants Speaker A, who is studying computer science and aims to develop apps for differently abled youth, to be interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n3. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n4. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n5. Speaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\n6. Speaker B suggests trying the game Elder Scrolls, knowing Speaker A plays World of Warcraft.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The choice should be based on which memory provides the most relevant information to respond to Speaker B's interest in history, particularly World War II. MEMORY 2 mentions Speaker B's volunteering experience, which could be relevant if Speaker A wants to discuss educational initiatives related to World War II. However, neither memory provides direct information about Speaker B's interest in World War II history, so both memories are similar in usefulness for this context.\n\nChoice: tie"
