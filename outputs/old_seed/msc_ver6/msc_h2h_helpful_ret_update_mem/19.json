Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\nSpeaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\nSpeaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\nSpeaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.\nSpeaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe?\nSpeaker B: There is some weird chemical mix that I really do not mess with.  It is easy to clean up.  I try to stay away from this part of the movies.  I know what it should look like and that we want to keep everyone safe when using the fake blood.\nSpeaker A: Chemicals!  Do the actors hate working with it then?  I can imagine they are a pretty high maintenance bunch.  Do they worry about the blood messing with their looks? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A recently moved to a new city and has two older brothers. Speaker A has recently received a call for a job interview and is excited about it. Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations. Speaker B's father was involved in producing horror movies, which influenced Speaker B's favorite genre. Speaker A also likes mid-century design and is a fan of horror movies.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\n2. Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them.\n3. Speaker A prefers classic horror movies like Halloween or Friday the 13th over modern ones.\n4. Speaker A also likes mid-century design and is a fan of horror movies.\n5. Speaker B's dad works on smaller projects and has never been involved in a major Hollywood film.\n6. Speaker B has a government job that pays the bills but wishes they could work in interior design.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 focuses on Speaker B's involvement in horror movie production and provides context about how Speaker B collaborates with their dad, which is relevant to the ongoing conversation about making horror movies. This memory ties back to Speaker B's experience and creative process, which could be useful in responding to Speaker A's further inquiries. Memory 2, while having overlaps, contains information less pertinent to the specific dialogue's context regarding how the actors might feel about the use of chemicals, such as Speaker B's government job and interior design desires, which do not directly relate to the topic of actors working with fake blood.\n\nChoice: 1"
