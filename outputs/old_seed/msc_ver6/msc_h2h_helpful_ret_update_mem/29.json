    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens?\nSpeaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month\nSpeaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.  Where are you going on vacation?\nSpeaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there!\nSpeaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and has a preference for seeing pandas and penguins, as well as exotic birds. They have been to the zoo before and go with their sister. On the other hand, Speaker A prefers cockatoos over kittens as pets.\n\nSpeaker A and Speaker B discuss their hobbies and interests, with Speaker A enjoying gardening and reading, while Speaker B enjoys visiting the zoo. Speaker B's girlfriend shares the same enjoyment of pandas and penguins at the zoo, and they visit the zoo every few weeks. Additionally, Speaker A's sister is a dog person with a yellow lab. Speaker B is willing to be a cool uncle to his sister's future children but does not want kids of his own.\n\nSpeaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and also loves visiting the zoo. Speaker A, on the other hand, enjoys seeing pandas, penguins, and exotic birds at the zoo and usually goes with their sister. Furthermore, Speaker A expresses a preference for cockatoos over kittens as pets.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo.\n2. Speaker A has been to the zoo before and enjoys seeing exotic birds.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss hobbies and interests, with Speaker A enjoying gardening and reading, and Speaker B enjoying visiting the zoo.\n4. Speaker A enjoys seeing pandas and penguins at the zoo and goes with their sister.\n5. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend.\n6. Speaker A prefers cockatoos over kittens as pets.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The memory should emphasize Speaker B's interest in visiting the zoo, as it relates directly to the last question from Speaker A (\"How good is their zoo?\"). Both memories provide information about Speaker B's love for the zoo and kittens, but MEMORY 2 is more concise and provides the same relevant details without the additional, less relevant information about wanting to be a \"cool uncle\" or Speaker A's sister's inclination for dogs, making it clearer and more directly useful for responding to Speaker A's question.\n\nChoice: 2"
