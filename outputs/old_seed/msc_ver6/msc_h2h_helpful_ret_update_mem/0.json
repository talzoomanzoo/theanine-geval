    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A is a high school student planning to go to college, achieving straight A's. Speaker A wants Speaker B to continue working in the lab and school instead of giving up their night job. Speaker B is also a high school student preparing for college, working at a diner at night. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner.\n2. Speaker B is considering giving up their night job to focus on lab work and school.\n3. Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n5. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n6. Speaker B is also a high school student preparing for college, working at a diner at night.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nMemory 2 is more helpful as it provides relevant information on Speaker B's plans and interests, such as working on weekends at a research lab and having an interest in neuroscience, which ties to the dialogue context about cloning and lab work. It also mentions Speaker B's consideration of quitting their night job to focus on more relevant activities, which is pertinent to the discussion of potential quitting due to class difficulties. Moreover, it highlights Speaker B's intention to major in molecular biology, aligning with the lab and cloning context.\n\nChoice: 2"
