    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well?\nSpeaker B: The older one seems to like it while the youngest cannot be bothered. Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon?\nSpeaker A: Yes!  As a matter of fact, I'm visiting my son that lives in Spain next month.  This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now!\nSpeaker B: Oh nice. You must be looking forward to it. He must have told you a lot about her. Do you think you would like her?\nSpeaker A: I think so.  She seems like a very sweet girl and she seems to care deeply about my son, so that's what matters most.  You know, maybe I can stop by and visit you as well, since you live in Europe.  France, Spain, Italy?  Where are you living now?\nSpeaker B: Bless her, that's good to hear. That would be great! I live in Portugal. It's not too far from Spain. We can always arrange something. How long would you be there for?\nSpeaker A: I'm planning to stay in Spain for three weeks.  Since you live in Portugal, I'd love to stop by for a visit if you're free this coming month.  I've always wanted to visit Lisbon.  It has the world's longest bridge! \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A's sons have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next. Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe.\nSpeaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite worrying about them traveling far away. Speaker B is trying to encourage one of their sons to get into programming or writing, but the son is more interested in gaming with friends. Speaker A's sons play video games and listen to music in their rooms.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A has two sons who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next.\n2. Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe.\n3. Speaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite worrying about them traveling far away.\n4. Speaker B's younger son would be jealous of Speaker A's sons' European tour.\n5. Speaker A's boys are leaving again in a few months for another trip after studying abroad.\n6. Speaker A is a family man who loves spending time with his sons.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains information about Speaker A's sons studying abroad and Speaker B's own family's interest, which doesn't directly relate to the current context of discussing a visit to Portugal. MEMORY 2, while containing some similar information, specifically highlights the aspect of travel plans and a potential European tour, which is more relevant to Speaker A visiting Europe.\n\nChoice: 2"
