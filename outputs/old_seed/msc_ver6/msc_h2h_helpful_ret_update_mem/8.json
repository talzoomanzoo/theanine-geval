This led Speaker B to find flights that work for their schedule and price, resulting in them planning to visit Speaker A in a couple of weeks. Speaker A has then invited Speaker B to visit them and is excited about the upcoming trip. \nSpeaker B, who enjoys warm days, cool mornings, and eating poached eggs, is now interested in visiting Alaska and considering getting blackout curtains due to the midnight sun. This interest led Speaker A to invite Speaker B to visit and mention looking into flights. As a result, Speaker B is now planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in activities like going to a concert, petting a wolf, and going on a glacier tour. \nSpeaker A, who drives a smart car and used to have a long commute in Alaska, has visited the state and found it beautiful, suggesting cheap flights to Anchorage. This suggestion led Speaker B to find suitable flights, resulting in them planning to visit Speaker A soon.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more helpful in this context as it succinctly encompasses the most pertinent points related to the planned visit and interest in activities during the visit. It gives a clear picture of the immediate plans and interests of both parties, which would directly help Speaker B in responding to Speaker A's question about looking for tickets. MEMORY 1, while comprehensive, contains additional information that is not immediately relevant to the situation, such as Speaker A's retirement plans or Speaker B's interests unrelated to the trip.\n\nChoice: 2"
