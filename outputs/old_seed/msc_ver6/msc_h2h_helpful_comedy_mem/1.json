    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal.\nSpeaker B: That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab!\nSpeaker A: Oh! I did not know that. Well if you can clone cows that's more ice cream for you! Haha. What's your favorite ice cream flavor? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B has a deaf dog named Sparky, a beagle breed. Speaker A is considering getting a dog and already walks Speaker B's dog, Sparky. Speaker B has invented a chili dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try. \nSpeaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description: Speaker A is a high school student who is going to college, has achieved straight A's, runs a lot, likes burgers after a run, listens to music on weekends, finds listening to music like meditation, and needs music to stay sane. Their parents are blue collar workers, with their dad working long hours in factories. \n\nRelationship Description: Speaker A and Speaker B share a close relationship, discussing topics like getting a dog, dogs with hearing issues, and sharing meals like hamburgers and ham soup.\n\nEvent Description: Speaker A and Speaker B have engaged in conversations about getting a dog, discussing the challenges of having dogs with hearing issues, sharing meals like hamburgers and ham soup, and joking about trying a casserole invented by Speaker B. Speaker B has also shared information about their night job cooking hamburgers and feeding lab rats at a research lab.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides relevant context about the relationship between Speaker A and Speaker B, including their shared experiences regarding meals and discussions about pets. This context might help Speaker B respond in a way that resonates with the shared experiences and common interests they have with Speaker A, such as discussing favorite foods or shared activities. MEMORY 1, while also containing related information, focuses more on specific past events rather than their ongoing relationship and interests.\n\nChoice: 2"
