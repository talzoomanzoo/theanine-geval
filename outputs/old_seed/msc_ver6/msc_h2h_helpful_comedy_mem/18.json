    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\nSpeaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\nSpeaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\nSpeaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.\nSpeaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A used to help their father on a farm in the past, which instilled a strong work ethic in them. This experience also shaped their appreciation for nature and the outdoors. \nSpeaker A recently moved to a new city and has two older brothers. Adjusting to a new environment has been challenging but exciting for Speaker A. They are looking forward to exploring the opportunities this city has to offer and reconnecting with their siblings. \nSpeaker B's father was involved in producing horror movies, which sparked Speaker B's interest in the genre. This influence led Speaker B to pursue a career in creating horror movies themselves.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nSpeaker A is a job seeker who is currently applying for a project coordinator role for a charity. They have had previous experiences of getting flustered in interviews when unexpected questions are asked, but they excel when they keep calm. Speaker A has a passion for horror movies and loves driving. They have two older brothers who can help with painting tasks.\n\nRelationship Description:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B have a friendly and supportive relationship. Speaker B, who has a government job and is not necessarily enjoying it, offered to paint Speaker A's house. Speaker B's two kids also help with tasks, showing a level of intimacy and willingness to help out.\n\nEvent Description:\nEvents shared by Speaker A and Speaker B include Speaker A's interview preparation, where they role-played an interview with a friend. Speaker A expressed nervousness about an upcoming interview and wishes for a government job like Speaker B's. Speaker B, on the other hand, prefers mid-century design and has a passion for painting. They have creative conversations with their family to come up with movie plots, and their work is destined to exist on Youtube. Speaker A admires Speaker B's involvement in horror movies and hopes for big-budget productions in the future. Speaker A is prepared for Monday's interview and wishes to settle into the new city with a rewarding job soon.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The focus of the current dialogue is on Speaker B's interest and involvement in making horror movies, specifically discussing details related to movie blood. MEMORY 1 provides context about Speaker B's background in horror movies through their father's involvement in the industry, which is directly relevant to the conversation. This information helps explain Speaker B's expertise in the field and could potentially lead to a richer dialogue about specific movie-making traditions or techniques if Speaker B chooses to share more about their background.\n\nMEMORY 2, on the other hand, contains more information about the relationship and unrelated events but does not specifically enhance the conversation about horror movie production or blood recipes. Thus, MEMORY 1 is more useful and relevant because it directly connects to the theme of the conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
