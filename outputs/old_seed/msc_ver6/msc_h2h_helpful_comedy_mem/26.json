    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains relevant information about Speaker B considering adopting a kitten from a friend, which directly addresses Speaker A's question about deciding to get a kitten. MEMORY 2, while it provides a broader context of their relationship and past discussions about pets, does not directly mention Speaker B's decision about adopting a kitten, making it less directly helpful in responding to the immediate question.\n\nChoice: 1"
