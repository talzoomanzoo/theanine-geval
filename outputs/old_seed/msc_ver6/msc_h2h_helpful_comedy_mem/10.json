I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week?\nSpeaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day\nSpeaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through\nSpeaker A: Actually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to it. Do you think I will need to rent a car when I'm there, or is it possible to walk and bike in the summer? I always picture huge amounts of snow but I'm not sure if it's like that all year round.\nSpeaker A: I would definitely recommend looking for a rental car to have on hand. There is a town within walking distance from me, but it can be dangerous to walk with the wolves and elk around, especially at night.\nSpeaker B: I imagine so!!! I wouldn't want to run into a wolf! Ok. I will add car rental to my plans. Do you get scared with your dogs, that you will run into wildilfe like that?\nSpeaker A: I think I'm more afraid of the wildlife than my dogs are. If I had to, I think I could muster the courage to face the animals out here, but I will happily avoid them when possible. With you around, I'd feel much better, as well. How do you feel about being that close to wildlife? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A, who has blue eyes and blonde hair, invited Speaker B to visit and mentioned looking into flights, which causes Speaker B to plan to visit Speaker A and be interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n\nSpeaker B enjoys warm days, cool mornings, and eating poached eggs, and Speaker A mentions the \"midnight sun\" phenomenon in Alaska where the sun does not set during the summer. Speaker A also talks about wildlife, including elk and wolves, which causes Speaker A to make poached eggs for breakfast and take sleds pulled by dogs.\n\nSpeaker A drives a smart car and used to have a long commute in Alaska, and suggests going on hikes in Alaska to see wildlife and mentions glaciers as a potential attraction, while Speaker B is planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nSpeaker A has blue eyes and blonde hair, prefers warmth, plans to retire down south on a beach, and enjoys eggs. Their favorite egg dish is egg benedict.\n\nRelationship Description:\nSpeaker A really likes their smart car, while Speaker B is a stereotypical old plumber who likes poached eggs. Speaker A suggested that Speaker B should seriously consider getting a smart car. They also discussed visiting Alaska and shared their excitement about the trip.\n\nEvent Description:\nSpeaker A had eggs for breakfast, thought of Speaker B when having eggs, and recommended looking into flights. They discussed airline fees, music festivals, and planned activities for the trip to Alaska, including petting wolves and going on a glacier tour. Speaker A and Speaker B are looking forward to spending time together and having a great experience.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
