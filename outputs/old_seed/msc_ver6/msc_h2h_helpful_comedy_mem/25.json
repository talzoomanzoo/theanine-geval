There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you?\nSpeaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions?\nSpeaker B: Unfortunately I mainly play games similar to RE. I don't know why I like them so much. I remember when I was little my brother play Doom and it gave me nightmares for a week. What genre of games you like?\nSpeaker A: I like all kinds of games. I like party, fighting, RPGs, shooters, action, adventure, and puzzle games. I enjoy playing Jurassic Park: World but I'd like to find another game to play. The storm means I'll be inside for a bit, so I think I'll curl up with some pizza and just zone out. Do you like to do anything else besides game when it's rainy?\nSpeaker B: Well, I might help around the house with cleaning or laundry, but not that much. Mostly gaming. If I feel I sat too long, I'll switch to Nintendo Switch's Ring Fit Adventure to get my body moving a bit. Do yo know that game? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A prefers tamer video games and is not a fan of horror movies. Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil. \nSpeaker A and Speaker B both enjoy playing video games in their free time. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to meet next week Friday at 6 pm to play games and order pizza.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description: Speaker B is an individual who enjoys playing video games, particularly horror games like Resident Evil VIII. They also have an interest in hunting and have played Jurassic Park: World. Speaker B is eager to play games late at night and spends most of their free time gaming. They also enjoy golfing and plan to alternate between golfing and hunting with Speaker A.\n\nRelationship Description: Speaker B and the robot have a close relationship, as they plan to play games together, with Speaker B teaching the robot how to hunt and the robot teaching Speaker B how to golf.\n\nEvent Description: Some shared events between Speaker B and the robot include playing Resident Evil VIII late at night, planning to play games and order pizza together, and the robot helping Speaker B get used to the UI of Resident Evil.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 contains relevant information about Speaker A's video game preferences, such as their interest in tamer video games and enjoyment of Jurassic Park: World. This is useful as Speaker B might want to suggest non-horror games to Speaker A. Additionally, it mentions Speaker A's willingness to try Resident Evil, which relates to their gaming conversation. Memory 2, on the other hand, mostly focuses on Speaker B's preferences and shared activities with the robot, which are not directly helpful to the current dialogue about game recommendations for Speaker A.\n\nChoice: 1"
