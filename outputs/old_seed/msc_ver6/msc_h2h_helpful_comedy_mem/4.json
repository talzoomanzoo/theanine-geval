    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\nSpeaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call!\nSpeaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip? \nSpeaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery\nSpeaker B: Yes I think that's a great idea, how is work at the library? \nSpeaker A: Busy, and demanding because we are short staffed. While there seems to be little need for a library these days, I find that we have less staff to get everything done\nSpeaker B: Well if you ever need someone to come and help for a couple of hours here and there, give me a call, you know how much I love to be in the library anyway\nSpeaker A: I will keep that in mind as we do have volunteer hours available. How is your family doing these days?\nSpeaker B: Well I would be happy to help. My family are all great thank you for asking I took the grandkids to the park again we had a great time. How's your family doing?  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B, having a lot of kids who are now grown up and have kids of their own, causes Speaker A to be busy with work and unable to spend as much time with their own kids as they would like. Speaker B, in contrast, wants to spend time with their grandkids at the park and enjoys it. This causes Speaker B to like the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature. Additionally, Speaker A has children and grandchildren, with at least one child interested in learning the flute.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description: Speaker B is a librarian who had a good day playing with his son's kids. He cherishes moments spent with his children and grandchildren. Speaker B's mother had the same profession as Speaker A. Speaker B has 3 grown-up children who mostly take the subway to work.\n\nRelationship Description: Speaker B and Speaker A share a mutual understanding and agreement on the challenges and rewards of being a librarian. They discuss the importance of libraries and the decline in children's interest in reading. Speaker A is proud to teach his youngest child the flute, which Speaker B finds interesting.\n\nEvent Description: Speaker B had a great time with his son and grandkids at the park. Speaker A thought about taking his grandkids to a library, and they discussed the relevance of paper books in the digital age. Speaker A's youngest child asked to learn the flute, inspired by Lizzo. Speaker B enjoys the creative ways libraries are staying relevant and mentioned a trip to the park with his grandkids.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories provide some context about Speaker B's relationship with his grandchildren and Speaker A's family situation. However, Memory 2 includes specific details about Speaker B's shared connection with Speaker A as librarians and their shared thoughts on the relevance of libraries and children's interest in reading. This is more relevant to the dialogue context, where they talk about libraries and family interactions. Memory 2 also connects the family experiences with the shared profession, providing a more holistic understanding of the conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
