    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A is a high school student planning to go to college, achieving straight A's. Speaker A wants Speaker B to continue working in the lab and school instead of giving up their night job. Speaker B is also a high school student preparing for college, working at a diner at night. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description: Speaker A is a high school student who is going to college, has achieved straight A's, runs a lot, likes burgers after a run, listens to music on weekends, finds listening to music like meditation, and needs music to stay sane. Their parents are blue collar workers, with their dad working long hours in factories. \n\nRelationship Description: Speaker A and Speaker B share a close relationship, discussing topics like getting a dog, dogs with hearing issues, and sharing meals like hamburgers and ham soup.\n\nEvent Description: Speaker A and Speaker B have engaged in conversations about getting a dog, discussing the challenges of having dogs with hearing issues, sharing meals like hamburgers and ham soup, and joking about trying a casserole invented by Speaker B. Speaker B has also shared information about their night job cooking hamburgers and feeding lab rats at a research lab.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains direct information about Speaker B working in the lab and at a diner, discussing hamburgers, which is directly relevant to the last utterance in the dialogue about not quitting and eating a hamburger from a cloned cow. It also includes Speaker A's hopes for Speaker B's educational and work continuation, aligning with the encouragement not to quit. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 provides more background on the relationship and topics discussed between the speakers but lacks the specific relevance to the lab work and hamburgers in this context.\n\nChoice: 1"
