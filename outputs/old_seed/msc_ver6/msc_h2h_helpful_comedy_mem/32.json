    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more helpful because it provides relevant context regarding Speaker A and Speaker B's shared interests in books and educational content. Given that the dialogue is about a book that Speaker A has checked out, knowing their history of discussing books and movies, as well as their mutual appreciation for education, offers a relevant background that could inform Speaker A's response about the new book they are reading. MEMORY 1, while providing some context about Speaker A's grandkids and exhaustion, does not directly relate to the book or the shared interests in reading.\n\nChoice: 2"
