Useful memory would contain information about the dynamics of their relationship, work-related skills, or their ability to collaborate effectively.\n\nMEMORY 1 contains a point about Classmate B encouraging Classmate A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future (2) and a note on how Classmate A's outgoing nature is admired by Classmate B, which could be relevant in terms of interactions or building a business together (5).\n\nMEMORY 2 repeats the point from MEMORY 1 about encouragement (which could evoke motivation in a business context) but adds nothing directly related to their working relationship specific to the marketing agency or business partnership.\n\nThe choice hinges on helpfulness relative to pursuing a business plan together.\n\nChoice: 1"
