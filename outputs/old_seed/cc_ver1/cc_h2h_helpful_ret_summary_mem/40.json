    "prediction": "Explanation: The Mentee asks the Mentor about imagining what it would be like to think like someone else. Memory 2 contains specific and relevant information about the mentee's experiences and feelings related to escaping from a cult and possibly understanding different perspectives, which can relate to the Mentee's question about thinking like someone else. Although Memory 1 also contains relevant aspects concerning helping others, it lacks the specific context of the Mentee's immediate concerns about escaping and gaining different perspectives, making Memory 2 more directly relevant and helpful in this context.\n\nChoice: 2"
