Both neighbors emphasize the importance of taking care of each other as neighbors.\n2. Neighbors A offers to help Neighbors B with getting into a workout routine.\n3. Neighbor A enjoys reading and sharing books with Neighbor B.\n4. Neighbors B offers to be more supportive and check in on Neighbors A more often.\n5. Neighbors A believes in setting goals, developing a positive attitude, and taking action for personal development and career advancement.\n6. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's career advancement and expresses interest in borrowing the personal development book.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nNeighbor A enjoys reading and sharing books with Neighbor B, which recently led to Neighbors A getting a new job as a secretary at a small marketing agency. This new job eventually caused Neighbors A to be promoted to manager and take on more responsibilities, leading to them feeling overwhelmed and stressed with a lot on their plate.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is about defining and marking a clear property boundary. This relates more to a conversation about responsibilities, boundaries, and perhaps stress from additional duties. Memory 2 directly mentions Neighbor A's new job, promotion, and resultant stress, which could relate to the importance Neighbor A places on clear boundaries to manage their tasks effectively. Memory 1, however, does not provide relevant context about boundaries or the stress Neighbor A might be experiencing that would make them want clear delineations in their property.\n\nChoice: 2"
