It's amazing how much you've accomplished since then.\nCo-workers A: It's been a journey, but I'm glad to see the business flourishing.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The helpfulness of a memory is determined by how well it enables Co-worker B to respond in a relevant and supportive way within the context of the conversation. \n\nMemory 1 contains more detailed information about Co-worker A's role and achievements in the family business, including efforts to modernize and invest in technology. This is directly relevant to Co-worker A's expression of pride and accomplishment in the current conversation, providing Co-worker B with more insights to affirm and continue the dialogue meaningfully. Additionally, Memory 1 contains the detail about the pen, which while not directly relevant to the immediate dialogue, adds a personal element to their interaction.\n\nMemory 2, while it mentions Co-worker A's takeover of the family business and its improvement, is less detailed and does not provide additional context or actions taken by Co-worker A, thereby limiting the richness of Co-worker B's potential responses.\n\nChoice: 1"
