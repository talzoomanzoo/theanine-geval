I'm a millionaire now!\nNeighbors B: Wow, that's incredible! How did it happen?\nNeighbors A: I inherited it from a distant relative.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is centered around Neighbors A inheriting a large sum of money and becoming a millionaire. To respond appropriately to Neighbors B's question about what Neighbors A plans to do with the money, the MEMORY should ideally provide insights into Neighbors A's past financial behavior, interests, dreams, or needs that could influence their decisions about handling their newfound wealth. Neither MEMORY directly addresses these points, but MEMORY 2 offers slightly more context about Neighbors A's previous situation of feeling stagnant in their job and desiring growth and challenge, indicating a possible openness to new opportunities or investing in personal development with the money.\n\nChoice: 2"
