    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context reveals that Classmates A is about to share future plans with Classmate B, indicating a relevance toward aspirations or potential activities. Memory 1 provides details of Classmates A's social characteristics and plans for future outings, but does not specifically address future plans. Memory 2, however, includes an element where Classmates A considers seeking help from a therapist or counselor, which may be a part of their future plans or steps they're considering for personal growth. This provides a more direct connection to discussing future ambitions or actions, making it more pertinent to the context.\n\nChoice: 2"
