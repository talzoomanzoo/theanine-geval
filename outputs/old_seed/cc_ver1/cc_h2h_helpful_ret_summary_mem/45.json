    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context revolves around managing feelings of frustration and the desire for independence. Classmates B mentions not wanting to be a burden, which suggests a need for emotional support or reassurance. Memory 1 includes information about a supportive relationship and shared experiences in music, which could be leveraged to offer comfort or remind Classmates B of their accomplishments. Memory 2, while also highlighting their supportive relationship, introduces irrelevant information about their excitement over new sports cars, which may not directly help address the emotional context. Therefore, Memory 1 provides more relevant context for helping Classmates B feel less troubled.\n\nChoice: 1"
