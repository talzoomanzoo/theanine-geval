    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit.\nNeighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water.\nNeighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it.\nNeighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Neighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\n2. Neighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A.\n3. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n4. Neighbors A and B have not seen each other in a while and are catching up.\n5. Neighbors A and B have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside.\n6. Neighbors A and Neighbors B are both neighbors who have known each other for years and have become good friends.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nNeighbors A and B started off not knowing each other well but wanting to spend more time together. As time passed, they became good friends and enjoy reminiscing about past events. Neighbors B, who is supportive, suggests making something together and shows consideration by suggesting having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context involves a situation where Neighbors A and B are discussing a recent incident involving Neighbors A pushing Neighbors B into cold water. In this context, MEMORY 2 provides more helpful information because it highlights the positive, supportive, and considerate aspects of their relationship, which is directly relevant to resolving conflict and repairing their relationship after the incident. MEMORY 1 also contains some of this information but is more fragmented and less concise compared to MEMORY 2.\n\nChoice: 2"
