This act caused Neighbor A to recently discover a park on Main Street with a playground and water park area. In the past, Neighbor A and Neighbor B found a park together a couple of years ago and enjoyed playing frisbee and having a picnic. This gesture of appreciation also led Neighbor B to value their friendship with Neighbor A. Additionally, Neighbor A reminisces about simpler times and expresses missing them.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: In evaluating the helpfullness of the memories for answering Neighbors B's question about whether Neighbors A has been back to the park recently, MEMORY 1 provides relevant past events related to their shared memory of the park experience. MEMORY 1 is more helpful because it directly references the park finding and their activities there (like playing frisbee and having a picnic), which ties into Neighbors A's previous mention of the park. MEMORY 2, while useful in terms of their past interaction and appreciation, is less directly related to the park and does not provide specific instances about the park itself or whether Neighbors A has been back. Therefore, MEMORY 1 is more relevant and useful in this context.\n\nChoice: 1"
