What kind of evidence did you collect? ### Co-workers A: I looked up some statistics that support our argument. I also gathered some personal accounts from our clients that show how the opposing side's actions affected them negatively. ### Co-workers B: Hmm. Sounds like you're well prepared. But what about the other side? They must have some evidence too, right? ### Co-workers A: Yes, they will have their own evidence to present. But I am confident that our argument is stronger. Our evidence is more compelling and clearly supports our position. ### Co-workers B: I hope you're right. Have you thought about how you're going to present your evidence in court? ### Co-workers A: Yes, I have. I plan to present my evidence clearly and concisely so that the judge cannot ignore it.

You're always looking for a fight and that's not healthy behavior. ### Co-workers A: I'm not looking for a fight, I'm just not afraid to defend myself. And sometimes that means getting physical. ### Co-workers B: But physical altercations are never the answer. You should know that by now. ### Co-workers A: I know, I know. But sometimes I just can't help it when someone is trying to push my buttons. ### Co-workers B: This is exactly why people perceive you as dangerous, Co-workers A. You need to learn how to control your emotions and handle conflicts in a more mature manner. ### Co-workers A: You're right. I'll work on it. But in the meantime, can we talk about something else?
