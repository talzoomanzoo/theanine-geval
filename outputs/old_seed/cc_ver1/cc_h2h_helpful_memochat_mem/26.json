Memory 1 revolves around personal shortcomings and the strive for perfection, which can loosely relate to work frustrations. However, it brings in specific examples like math mistakes that might not directly aid the discussion about workplace dissatisfaction. Memory 2 is more focused on mutual support and community, which can be a helpful basis for offering empathetic advice or suggesting ways to help Neighbor A cope with their work situation through support and problem-solving strategies.\n\nChoice: 2"
