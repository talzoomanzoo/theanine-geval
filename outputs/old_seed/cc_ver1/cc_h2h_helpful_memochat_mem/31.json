This new job eventually caused Neighbors A to be promoted to manager and take on more responsibilities, leading to them feeling overwhelmed and stressed with a lot on their plate.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains no additional information beyond the last utterance of the dialogue and provides no new context or details that can help Neighbors A respond more appropriately. MEMORY 2, although it doesn't directly relate to the boundary line issue, provides a background about Neighbor A's current life situation, which could be useful if discussing stress, job responsibilities, or work-life balance topics. However, in terms of addressing the topic of property boundaries, MEMORY 2 is also not directly relevant.\n\nChoice: tie"
