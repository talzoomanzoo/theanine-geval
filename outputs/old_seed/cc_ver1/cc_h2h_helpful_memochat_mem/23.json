    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue is focused on Neighbors A becoming a millionaire due to an inheritance, and discussing plans for the newfound wealth. MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 both cover the topic of Neighbors A contemplating a career change. However, in the context of the dialogue, the inheritance and new financial status could lead to considering new opportunities and life changes, which aligns with Neighbors A's previous dissatisfaction with their job as described in the memories. MEMORY 2 provides more background on Neighbors A's previous career dissatisfaction and the positive outcome of the change, which could be relevant if future plans are discussed in the dialogue. However, neither memory directly relates to the specific context of inheriting wealth and does not provide directly helpful information for discussing \"what to do with all that money.\"\n\nChoice: 2"
