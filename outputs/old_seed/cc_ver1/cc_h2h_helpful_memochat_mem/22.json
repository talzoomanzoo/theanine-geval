    "prediction": "Explanation: The current dialogue between Neighbors A and B revolves around Neighbors A becoming a millionaire and Neighbors B's curiosity about how it happened. MEMORY 2 hints that Neighbor A made a big career change recently and feels happier, which aligns with the context of becoming a millionaire, possibly due to this change. MEMORY 1, while discussing career dissatisfaction and the need for change, does not directly connect Neighbors A becoming a millionaire with a change that has already taken place. MEMORY 2 offers a more logical narrative that could explain the sudden wealth, making it more relevant and useful for the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 2"
