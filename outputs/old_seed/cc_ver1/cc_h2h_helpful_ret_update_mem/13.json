    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, have you noticed how strong I've become? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Neighbors B appreciates Neighbors A's handy skills.\n2. Neighbor A noticed some wood near their backyard and asked Neighbor B if they had seen it too.\n3. Neighbors A values double-checking before leaving the house.\n4. Neighbors A is good at fixing things, particularly electronics.\n5. Neighbors A and B are observing wood that appears to be freshly cut from a tree.\n6. Neighbors A apologized to Neighbors B for their behavior and admitted to being wrong.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nNeighbors A and B appreciate the resourcefulness of using fallen trees for firewood or other purposes. Neighbor A values their friendship with Neighbor B and wants to ensure it remains strong. Neighbor A noticed some wood near their backyard and asked Neighbor B if they had seen it too. Neighbors A did not bring any notes or textbooks to school, causing them to leave their backpack at home once and had to borrow notes from a classmate. Neighbor A feels like they should have been more prepared for the test, which leads to them valuing double-checking before leaving the house.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The helpfulness criterion requires information that is useful and relevant to respond appropriately to Neighbors A's comment about their improved strength. MEMORY 1 mentions that Neighbors A is handy and good at fixing electronics, which could relate to activities that build physical strength. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 contains details about the friendship and preparedness habits of Neighbors A, which are not directly connected to the topic of physical strength or becoming stronger. Thus, MEMORY 1 provides more relevant context that Neighbors B could use to follow up on Neighbors A's claim of strength, potentially linking it to their handy or repair work.\n\nChoice: 1"
