    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Can you believe it? I'm a millionaire now!\nNeighbors B: Wow, that's incredible! How did it happen?\nNeighbors A: I inherited it from a distant relative. It's still sinking in, to be honest.\nNeighbors B: That's amazing, congratulations! What are you going to do with all that money? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Neighbors A made a big career change recently and is much happier now.\n2. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's decision and admires the courage it took.\n3. Neighbors A took the leap to make a change and is glad they did.\n4. Neighbors B has been supportive of Neighbors A's job search, offering to connect them with people in different industries.\n5. Neighbors A and B had a conversation a couple of years ago about needing a change.\n6. Neighbors A and B have a friendly and supportive relationship.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nNeighbors A is feeling stagnant in their current job and is looking for more growth and challenge. This caused Neighbors A to make a big career change recently and they are much happier now. \nNeighbors A appreciates Neighbors B's understanding and willingness to listen and talk about the experience. Neighbors B has been supportive of Neighbors A's job search, offering to connect them with people in different industries.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses on Neighbors A inheriting a large sum of money, not exclusively on career changes or support from Neighbors B in finding a new job. MEMORY 1 includes information about a supportive relationship and a past career change, which could be relevant as Neighbors A figures out what to do with the money. However, MEMORY 2 reiterates similar information but adds nothing specific about the relationship or the inheritance situation. The focus on a career search isn't directly relevant to how Neighbors A plans to use the inherited money. \n\nChoice: 1"
