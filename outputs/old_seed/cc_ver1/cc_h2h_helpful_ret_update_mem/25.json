Have you thought about investing any of it?\nNeighbors A: Yes, actually. I've been doing some research and I think I want to invest in some stocks and maybe even start my own business.\nNeighbors B: That sounds like a great idea.

You don't really have to work if you don't want to.\nNeighbors A: I know, but I don't think I could ever completely give up working. Plus, I have some ideas for businesses that I want to pursue.
