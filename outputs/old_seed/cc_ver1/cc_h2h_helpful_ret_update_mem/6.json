I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it.\nCo-workers B: That's not the same thing, Co-workers A. Stealing someone and keeping them against their will is illegal and immoral. You need to let go of this obsession and move on.\nCo-workers A: I know you're right, Co-workers B. I just don't know how to get over this feeling. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\n2. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\n3. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's positivity and friendship.\n4. Co-worker A is alive but will need time to adjust to their new way of life.\n5. Co-worker B is supportive and willing to help in any way.\n6. Co-worker A intervened to help two women who were fighting, showing bravery and a desire to make a positive impact.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nCo-worker B showed a willingness to assist others by helping a customer resolve an issue last week, which reflects their supportive nature. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it, similar to the feeling of guilt when Co-worker A spoke with the police about an incident. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and suggested making it up by buying coffee next time, showing their supportive and understanding nature. Co-worker B commended Co-worker A for their bravery and willingness to help, which inspired Co-worker A to stay positive and focus on their recovery as a daunting task. Co-worker B's admiration for Co-worker A's resilience and positivity is appreciated, highlighting the bond of friendship between them.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context focuses on a serious situation where Co-worker A is considering taking an inappropriate action due to their feelings for someone, and Co-worker B is trying to provide guidance. The helpful memory should provide Co-worker B with relevant context or previous interactions that would help address Co-worker A's feelings and behavior. MEMORY 1 mentions a past incident where Co-worker A felt guilty about borrowing a pencil, which Co-worker B reassured as not a big deal, paralleling Co-worker A's current feelings of guilt. MEMORY 1 also highlights Co-worker B's supportive nature and Co-worker A's previous positive actions, which can help Co-worker B guide Co-worker A towards moving past their obsession. MEMORY 2 contains similar information but includes extra context that isn't directly relevant (helping a customer resolve an issue), making it slightly less focused for the dialogue. \n\nChoice: 1"
