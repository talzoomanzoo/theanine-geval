    "prediction": "Explanation: Classmates A and B's current discussion in the dialogue context is about starting a business togetherâ€”a marketing agency specialized in social media. In this context, relevant information would pertain to their working relationship or their interests that could impact this business suggestion. MEMORY 2 contains slightly more relevant information regarding their enjoyment of social activities, which could suggest a shared interest in marketing that often involves social environments. However, MEMORY 1 includes specific acknowledgment of complementing skills, which is more directly related to the business idea. Overall, neither MEMORY directly addresses professional collaboration or specific skills that contribute to a business partnership, but MEMORY 1's hint at complementary skills may slightly suggest a business compatibility.\n\nChoice: 1"
