    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination.\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off.\nNeighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks?\nNeighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else.\nNeighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location?\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Neighbor A considers using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder.\n2. Neighbor A and Neighbor B discuss organizing a community event to make a positive impact and appreciate the beauty of their city.\n3. Neighbor A considers Neighbor B a great neighbor and wanted to do something special for them.\n4. Neighbor A has skills in manipulation and getting what they want.\n5. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's gardening skills and wishes to have a green thumb.\n6. Neighbor B is against Neighbor A's idea, emphasizing the ethical and legal implications.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nNeighbor A values their friendship with Neighbor B, describing them as a great neighbor, which causes Neighbor A to consider using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder.\nNeighbor A helped Neighbor B build a new house with amazing features, and in reaction, Neighbor B reminds Neighbor A of their potential to do good things, referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them. This makes Neighbor A want to believe that plants need sunlight, water, and love to thrive.\nNeighbor A enjoys building houses and finishing them quickly, which causes Neighbor B to be grateful for the help and quick completion of the new home, resulting in Neighbor B receiving a new house built by Neighbor A and being grateful for the extra space.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The helpfulness criteria require the MEMORY to be both relevant and useful in enabling Neighbor B to respond further in the context of the dialogue, which is focused on productivity, procrastination, and strategies to enhance focus. MEMORY 2 contains information about the appreciation and mutual support between Neighbors A and B, including examples of physical productivity, such as building a house, which is more relevant to the context of achieving goals and overcoming procrastination. In contrast, MEMORY 1 mainly includes unrelated details and lacks direct relevance to the current conversation, which aims to address ways to enhance productivity.\n\nChoice: 2"
