It's a great way to better understand and empathize with others.\nMentee: That's exactly what I thought. I've been trying to imagine what personY is thinking lately. It's been helping me to understand their perspective a bit better.\nMentor: That's a great approach. Putting ourselves in someone else's shoes can help us see things from a different angle and see where they're coming from. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Mentor became a mentor to help others going through similar situations.\n2. Mentee wants to make a positive impact in people's lives and is grateful for Mentor's support.\n3.

This reaction made Mentee want to help others who may be in abusive cults.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is focused on empathy and understanding others' perspectives. Memory 1 mentions that the Mentor became a mentor to help others going through similar situations, like those in abusive cults, which is directly related to the conversation about understanding others. It also mentions Mentee's thoughts about helping others in such situations, which aligns with the exploration of perspectives. Memory 2, while detailed, does not clearly connect these experiences to the discussion of empathy and understanding in a direct way. It includes more specific past experiences that do not directly inform the current dialogue.\n\nChoice: 1"
