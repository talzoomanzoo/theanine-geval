    "prediction": "Explanation: When examining the memories for helpfulness, the context of the dialogue indicates that the Wife is encouraging the Husband to experiment and try something new with his writing. MEMORY 1 provides relevant information about the Husband's tendency to use old-fashioned language, and the Wife's encouragement of him embracing his uniqueness, which aligns with supporting him to step outside his comfort zone in writing. Additionally, it highlights their supportive relationship, which is pertinent to the dialogue's theme of encouragement. MEMORY 2 covers a similar supportive theme but lacks the specific detail regarding the husband stepping out of his comfort zone and experimenting with new approaches, which is directly pertinent to the dialogue context of encouraging the husband to try something different with his writing.\n\nChoice: 1"
