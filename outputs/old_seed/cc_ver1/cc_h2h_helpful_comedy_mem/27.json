    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is about Co-worker A singing a solo at church. It mostly revolves around Co-worker A's singing experience and their interaction with Co-worker B. Memory 1 contains relevant information about their professional relationship and shared experiences at work but doesn't connect directly to the singing. Memory 2, although similar in terms of the nature of content (detective work, treating themselves), also doesn't contain information directly relevant to the singing. However, neither memory provides a closer connection to the singing context, making it hard to choose one as more helpful based solely on the available dialogue context.\n\nChoice: tie"
