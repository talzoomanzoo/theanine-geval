    "prediction": "Explanation: The conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is focused on Neighbor A's recent inheritance, their plans for the money, and consideration of investments. While both memories indicate a supportive relationship between Neighbors A and B, MEMORY 2 is more directly related to Neighbor A's current situation of considering new ventures, as it mentions a big career change and Neighbors B's support in connecting with different industries. This can be useful for Neighbor B to tie back to the new business Neighbor A mentioned considering. In contrast, MEMORY 1 includes a broader background of their relationship and other events, which are less directly relevant to the immediate conversation about investment and financial decisions.\n\nChoice: 2"
