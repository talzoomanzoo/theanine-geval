    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about Neighbors A becoming a millionaire through inheritance and discussing what they plan to do with the money. To respond appropriately, Neighbors A would benefit from memory that reflects their current situation as a newly minted millionaire, rather than their past job situation. Neither MEMORY 1 nor MEMORY 2 directly addresses the topic of inheritance or current plans for newfound wealth, but MEMORY 1 provides a broader context of supportive interaction and a history of personal sharing, which might more generally influence the tone and nature of a response about such a life-changing event. \n\nChoice: 1"
