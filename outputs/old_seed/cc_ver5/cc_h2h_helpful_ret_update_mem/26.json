    "prediction": "Explanation: Both MEMORY options do not directly address the topic of what sets the class apart, as discussed in the dialogue. However, MEMORY 2 seems to have slightly more relevant content in the context of appreciation and valuing relationships, which may tie into the theme of community mentioned by Classmate A. It mentions appreciation and honesty about feelings, which can somewhat relate to the supportive nature of the community that Classmate A is highlighting. MEMORY 2 also includes a relevant sentiment of still being friends despite differences, which aligns with the supportive community aspect.\n\nChoice: 2"
