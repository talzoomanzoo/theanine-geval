    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Classmates A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I know you know something about my past. Can you tell me what it is?\nClassmates B: I'm sorry,, but I can't disclose that information. It's not my place to tell. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Classmates B warns Classmates A about the potential danger of dark alleys.\n2. Classmates A is curious and open to exploring new things and taking risks.\n3. Classmates B advises Classmates A to be careful and aware while on the bus.\n4. Classmates B appreciates the genuine friendship and positive attitude of Classmates A.\n5. Classmates A doesn't have their own car yet and takes the bus.\n6. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to keep striving towards their goals.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Classmates B warns Classmates A about the potential danger of dark alleys because Classmates A doesn't have their own car yet and takes the bus.\n   \n2. After discussing the benefits of a positive mindset in making a difference in the world, Classmates B appreciates the genuine friendship and positive attitude of Classmates A, which leads to Classmates B encouraging Classmates A to keep striving towards their goals. This makes Classmates A curious and open to exploring new things and taking risks.\n\n3. When Classmates A and B discuss the benefits of a positive mindset in making a difference in the world, Classmates A was nervous about fitting in but saw Classmates B as well-liked and wanted to be friends with them. As a reaction, Classmates B advises Classmates A to be careful and aware while on the bus, relating to the topic of warning about the potential danger of dark alleys.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: In the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT, Classmate A is asking Classmate B if they know something about Classmate A's past, and Classmate B expresses an inability to disclose that information. The relevant MEMORY would provide information about the relationship and trust dynamics between Classmates A and B that could relate to the confidentiality or sensitivity of the past information in question.\n\nMEMORY 1 contains advice and friendship dynamics but does not directly address anything related to past information or confidentiality. It is somewhat helpful as it provides context on their relationship, but it is not strongly relevant to the specific query about knowing something about the past.\n\nMEMORY 2 also discusses similar themes like warning about danger and encouragement, but offers a slightly deeper insight into the trust and influence dynamics between Classmates A and B (where A wanted to be friends with B and was nervous about fitting in). This indirect insight might explain why B is not disclosing information. Despite not being directly about classmate A's past, the dynamics of trust and friendship are more elaborately discussed, potentially giving context to why B would refrain from disclosing information.\n\nChoice: 2"
