Having a supportive boss can make all the difference in how you feel about your job.\nCo-workers A: Definitely. It makes me feel secure in my position and motivated to do my best work.\nCo-workers B: It's great to have that kind of positive reinforcement. Do you remember when we were working on that movie together and you were feeling really frustrated?\nCo-workers A: Oh yeah, I remember. I was so angry after blowing up that rabbit with the dynamite. But talking it out with you really helped me work through my emotions.\nCo-workers B: That's right. It's important to have someone to talk to when you're feeling overwhelmed or upset.\nCo-workers A: And speaking of talking it out, do you remember when I was a kid and I ran to our parents screaming because of that spider? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B feel that their collaboration brought out the best in each other during the shoot.\n2. Co-worker A had a tough week on set, feeling overwhelmed and chaotic.\n3. Co-worker B acknowledges that some people have fears and suggests finding healthy ways to deal with frustrations.\n4. Co-worker A and Co-worker B met on a movie set and are now good friends.\n5. Co-worker B encourages Co-worker A to try relaxation techniques or find a hobby to de-stress and overcome fears.\n6. Co-worker B and Co-worker A met on a movie set where Co-worker A was focused on acting.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. [Co-worker B was nervous about working with Co-worker A because of their talent as an actor.] - (Causes) - [Co-worker B emphasized the importance of learning from mistakes and working together as a team.] - (React) - [Co-worker B acknowledges that some people have fears and suggests finding healthy ways to deal with frustrations.]\n\n2. [Co-worker A and Co-worker B met on a movie set and are now good friends.] - (SameTopic) - [Co-worker A felt remorse for what they did and appreciated Co-worker B's understanding.] - (React) - [Co-worker A has grown as a person and as an artist, learning about empathy and compassion.]\n\n3. [Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B feel that their collaboration brought out the best in each other during the shoot.] - (React) - [Co-worker A had a tough week on set, feeling overwhelmed and chaotic.] - (React) - [Co-worker A mentions a past event involving blowing up a rabbit with dynamite, indicating a history of poor coping mechanisms for frustration.]\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories provide context about Co-worker A and Co-worker B's past interactions and Co-worker A's challenges with frustration and fear. However, Memory 2 provides more detailed information about specific past interactions, showing Co-worker A's growth and learning experiences related to dealing with fears and frustrations, which directly ties into the conversation about reactions to fear (the spider incident) and frustration (blowing up the rabbit incident). This makes Memory 2 more contextually helpful for continuing the conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
