    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context reveals that Classmates B is feeling embarrassed rather than sunburned. To respond appropriately, Classmates A could draw from past experiences or traits shared between them that involve emotions, support, or learning from each other's strengths. Memory 1 includes Classmates B's struggle with parking and gratitude for Classmates A's patience, which could be helpful in providing reassurance or a lighthearted distraction from their embarrassment. Memory 2 seems to lack immediate relevance as it doesn't specifically offer relatable content about embarrassment or moments of support in other situations. \n\nChoice: 1"
