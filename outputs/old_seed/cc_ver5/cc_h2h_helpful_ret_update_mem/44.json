I thought we were happy together.\nNeighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Neighbor A is grieving the recent loss of their grandmother.\n2. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have a close friendship and have shared memories of spending time together in the park.\n3. Neighbor B is offering support and companionship to Neighbor A during their difficult time.\n4. Neighbor A and Neighbor B are neighbors who catch up outside of their neighborhood.\n5. Neighbor A recently moved to a new neighborhood and feels safer and happier there.\n6. Neighbor A's old apartment building was not the best place to live in.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nNeighbor A recently moved to a new neighborhood and feels safer and happier there. This change led to Neighbor A appreciating the emotional support and understanding from Neighbor B during their time of grief. Neighbor A was tired of living in a run-down apartment complex, which caused them and Neighbor B to become neighbors who catch up outside of their neighborhood. Furthermore, Neighbor B's mention of the affluent neighborhood made Neighbor A want to go for walks, leading to both neighbors enjoying walks together, especially to the park. Their shared love for the park has strengthened their close friendship, with shared memories of spending time together there.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 primarily provides information that is not directly related to the current emotional situation of Neighbor A, which is their recent heartbreak. While it mentions Neighbor A's grief and the support from Neighbor B, it lacks direct relevance to a romantic relationship or breakup scenario. Memory 2 emphasizes the emotional support and understanding provided by Neighbor B, which is directly relevant to Neighbor A's situation. Additionally, it highlights their shared activities and close friendship, which can be comforting and supportive given Neighbor A's current emotional distress.\n\nChoice: 2"
