I'm a millionaire now!\nNeighbors B: Wow, that's incredible! How did it happen?\nNeighbors A: I inherited it from a distant relative. It's still sinking in, to be honest. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1.

Neighbors A took the leap to make a change and is glad they did.\n4. Neighbors A and B had a conversation a couple of years ago about needing a change.\n5.

Neighbors A and B have a friendly and supportive relationship.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nNeighbors A is feeling stagnant in their current job and is looking for more growth and challenge, which caused Neighbors A to make a big career change recently and become much happier now. \nNeighbors A appreciates Neighbors B's understanding and willingness to listen and talk about the experience, leading Neighbors B to be supportive of Neighbors A's job search and offer to connect them with people in different industries, admiring the courage it took. \nNeighbors B is supportive and believes Neighbors A's story, which made Neighbors A take the leap to make a change and is glad they did.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The conversation revolves around Neighbors A becoming a millionaire due to an inheritance. Memory 1 focuses on career changes, happiness, and mutual support, which are not directly related to the newfound wealth topic. Memory 2 also focuses on career changes and support but adds context about Neighbors B's belief in Neighbors A's story and their courageous leap, which could slightly relate to the financial success being discussed. However, both memories lack direct relevance to the topic of inheritance and wealth, making neither particularly helpful for the current dialogue context.\n\nChoice: tie"
