It's a very fulfilling job.\nClassmates B: That's great to hear! How did you get into carpentry?\nClassmates A: My dad was a carpenter, so I grew up around it. I started by helping him out when I was young, and then I began to really enjoy it myself.\nClassmates B: That's awesome that you were able to learn from your dad and turn it into a career. Have you done any big projects lately?\nClassmates A: Yeah, I just finished building a custom bookshelf for a client. It was a challenging project, but I'm really happy with how it turned out.\nClassmates B: That's impressive! You must have a lot of skill to be able to build something like that.\nClassmates A: Thanks! It definitely takes a lot of practice and attention to detail. But I find it really rewarding to see a finished product that I created with my own two hands.\nClassmates B: I can imagine. It must also be nice to have a steady income from your work. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Classmates B is supportive and encourages Classmates A in their business venture.\n2. Classmates A is attending a seminar on starting a business and is excited about applying that knowledge to future plans.\n3.

Classmate A supports the President and believes he is doing a good job, which is the same topic when Classmates A appreciates the support and encouragement from Classmates B.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue focuses on Classmates A's profession as a carpenter and a recent project they completed. MEMORY 1 contains information about Classmates A and B's supportive dynamic related to business ventures, which is relevant to the current topic about carpentry and professional work. Reference to entrepreneurship, support, and willingness to work hard can connect to the dialogue about the rewarding nature of carpentry and the importance of skill and practice. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 introduces unrelated topics such as political support and singing, which are not pertinent to the current conversation about carpentry and recent projects, making it far less useful. \n\nChoice: 1"
