    "prediction": "Explanation: The current Dialogue Context is about a confrontation regarding a suspected affair.

This context could help Classmates A decide how to approach the allegation or resolve concerns. MEMORY 2, while providing some overlap about their interests and interactions, is less directly relevant to the relational aspect brought up in the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 1"
