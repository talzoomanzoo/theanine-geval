Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking?\nCo-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for asking me to join you. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Co-worker B is supportive and encouraging towards Co-worker A.\n2. Co-worker B reassures Co-worker A and encourages them to have more confidence.\n3. Co-worker B points out that Co-worker A doesn't always consider how their actions can affect others.\n4. Co-workers A and B have worked together on a big story in the past.\n5. Co-worker A is trying to be more conscious of how their actions impact others and avoid causing problems for anyone else.\n6. Co-worker A appreciates Co-worker B's support and plans to perform in the final round of the competition.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nCo-worker A has made mistakes in the past but is trying to be more aware of their actions, which has led Co-worker B to move on from their arrest and appreciate Co-worker A's concern and change in behavior. As a result, Co-worker B is supportive and encouraging towards Co-worker A. Co-worker A is trying to be more conscious of how their actions impact others and avoid causing problems for anyone else, prompting Co-worker B to reassure them that making mistakes is okay as long as they learn from them. This reassurance from Co-worker B also encourages Co-worker A to have more confidence. Additionally, Co-worker B mentions that Co-worker A is responsible in their work, even if not always in other aspects of life, and reminds them of their progress and potential for success.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is about Co-worker A inviting Co-worker B to lunch, with Co-worker B accepting and expressing gratitude. The helpful memory would provide relevant past interactions or attitudes that support the friendliness and camaraderie between the two co-workers at the moment.\n\nMEMORY 1 provides multiple insights into how Co-worker B has supported and encouraged Co-worker A in the past and also mentions their previous collaboration. MEMORY 2, while providing comprehensive background on past mistakes and growth, delves into aspects not directly relevant to the current social invitation and may not enhance the immediate context of arranging a lunch meeting.\n\nChoice: 1"
