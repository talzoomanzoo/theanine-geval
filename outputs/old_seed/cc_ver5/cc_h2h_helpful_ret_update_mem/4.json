Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit.\nNeighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water.\nNeighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it.\nNeighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again.\nNeighbors A: I won't. So, do you remember the time when I mowed the lawn with that old push mower?\nNeighbors B: Yeah, I remember that. That was pretty tough work.\nNeighbors A: It was. But it was also a good workout.\nNeighbors B: I prefer to work out indoors where there's air conditioning. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Both Neighbors A and B enjoy spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn.\n2. Neighbors B agrees that mowing the lawn is a lot of work but acknowledges the exercise it provides.\n3. Neighbors A mentioned mowing the lawn with an old push mower, indicating they are responsible for the yard work.\n4. Neighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\n5.

Neighbors A and B plan to work on mowing the lawn together next time to make it easier and possibly discover more things in common.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nNeighbors A and B initially wanted to spend more time together as they didn't know each other well. Now, they are on friendly terms and enjoy spending time together. Additionally, both neighbors enjoy spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn. As a result, Neighbor B agrees that mowing the lawn is a lot of work but acknowledges the exercise it provides. Furthermore, they plan to hang out once a week, possibly watching a movie, getting coffee, or just talking. This indicates that Neighbors A and B have not seen each other in a while and are catching up. Moreover, Neighbor A mentioned mowing the lawn with an old push mower, suggesting they are responsible for the yard work. This is related to Neighbor A feeling pressured to look perfect all the time by their mom, who scolds them for ripping off the tag from their new shirt.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
