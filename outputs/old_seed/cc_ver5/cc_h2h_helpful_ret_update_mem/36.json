    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: It's great to have friends who can help each other out, isn't it?\nNeighbors B: Absolutely. It's a two-way street, and it's important to be there for each other.\nNeighbors A: I remember when I helped you move last year, and then you watched my cat when I went on vacation.\nNeighbors B: Yes, and I appreciate it so much. It's always nice to have someone you can count on.\nNeighbors A: That's true. And speaking of which, I'm helping another friend move next weekend. It'll be a big job, but I know they'd do the same for me.\nNeighbors B: That's great. And if you need any help, just let me know.\nNeighbors A: Thanks, I will. I always feel like I can ask for help when I need it, and that's a really good feeling. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Neighbors A thanked Neighbors B for the suggestion.\n2. Neighbors B offered to help Neighbors A with the apology process.\n3. Both neighbors express the difficulty of not being able to adopt all the animals they see but appreciate those who do adopt and give them loving homes.\n4. Neighbors A bought a necklace from Neighbors B's shop and loves it.\n5. Neighbors B emphasized the importance of apologizing to show care for the relationship.\n6. Neighbors A was looking for a new necklace and stumbled upon Neighbors B's shop.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nNeighbors A thanked Neighbors B for the suggestion to visit their shop, where Neighbors A found a new necklace and loved it. This led to a discussion on the importance of strength in apologizing, with both neighbors agreeing on the sentiment.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around the theme of helping friends, supporting each other, and reciprocity. In the memories provided, the focus is mostly on interactions about shopping and apologies rather than directly related to helping with tasks, as the current dialogue suggests. However, MEMORY 2 presents a more coherent summary of the events (e.g., the suggestion to visit Neighbors B's shop) and connects with a discussion about the importance of strength, reflecting mutual support and positive interaction, making it more contextually relevant.\n\nChoice: 2"
