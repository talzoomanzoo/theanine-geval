I shouldn't have lost my temper like that.\nNeighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset?\nNeighbors A: It was just something that happened at work. My boss was being unreasonable and I couldn't take it anymore. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1.

Neighbors A and B have a positive and helpful relationship as neighbors.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nNeighbor A mentioned cleaning up a tree house to prevent insects and spiders from living in it, and Neighbor B agrees, mentioning the sense of community built through helping each other. Neighbor B recalls a past experience where their tree house was destroyed due to lack of proper care, and Neighbor A helped with their lawn, showing mutual support between them. As a result, Neighbor A and B are planning to work together to rearrange the living room over the weekend.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The most appropriate memory should provide relevant context that aids Neighbor B in understanding or responding to the current situation. Memory 1 highlights Neighbor B's supportive nature, which is directly applicable to Neighbor A's upset situation at work. This sets the stage for Neighbor B to continue providing empathy and understanding. Memory 2 focuses more on a shared activity unrelated to the current issue, which is less likely to be immediately helpful in this context.\n\nChoice: 1"
