I feel like we have something special going on here.\nClassmates B:  You're right. Our class definitely has a unique energy about it. What do you think sets us apart from other classes?\nClassmates A:  I think it's our sense of community. We all support each other and work together to achieve our goals. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Classmates B complimented Classmates A on their suit and brought up a past conversation about feelings.\n2. Classmate B feels relieved that they can still be friends with Classmate A.\n3. Classmates B appreciates Classmates A's honesty about their feelings, but doesn't feel the same way.\n4.

Despite the rejection, Classmate A values their friendship with Classmate B.\n6. Classmate A has been hiding their feelings for Classmate B and finally confesses to being in love with them.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Classmate A finally confesses their love to Classmate B, who responds by complimenting their suit and discussing past conversations about feelings.\n2. Classmate B appreciates Classmate A's honesty about their feelings, but unfortunately, does not feel the same way, causing Classmate A to feel heartbroken.\n3. While Classmate B enjoys people watching at the mall, they are relieved to still be friends with Classmate A, who is looking forward to a fun night out at a wedding reception wearing a black suit.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is about Classmate B asking what sets their class apart from others, which Classmate A replies is their sense of community and support. This indicates the conversation is about the class dynamic and relationships among classmates, rather than a personal or romantic relationship between the two classmates. Both memories mention a personal relationship dynamic, with Classmate A expressing love for Classmate B and Classmate B not reciprocating, but Memory 2 has a slightly more relevant mention of other social activities that might loosely relate to community-building, such as enjoying people-watching and attending a wedding reception. However, neither memory is particularly helpful for responding to the current context of discussing class dynamics.\n\nChoice: tie"
