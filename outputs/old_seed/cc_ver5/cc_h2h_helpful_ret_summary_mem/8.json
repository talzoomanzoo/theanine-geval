What are they?\nClassmates A: Well, I was thinking that we could work on a project together and maybe even become business partners.\nClassmates B: Wow, that sounds amazing! What kind of project are you thinking about?\nClassmates A: I was thinking about starting a marketing agency specialized in social media.\nClassmates B: That's a great idea! I'd love to work with you on that. We could really make a difference in the industry.\nClassmates A: Yes, exactly! And I think our skills complement each other's so well.\nClassmates B: I totally agree. You're so creative and outgoing, while I'm more analytical and detail-oriented.\nClassmates A: It's like we were meant to work together, right?\nClassmates B: Absolutely! I can't wait to see what the future holds for us.\nClassmates A: Me too. And honestly, it's a bit of a relief to finally have a solid plan for the future.\nClassmates B: Yeah, I get that. Speaking of the future, how have you been doing with your sleeping problems?\nClassmates A: It's been a slow process, but I've been making progress with it. I started doing yoga and meditation before bed, and that's been helping a lot.\nClassmates B: That's great to hear. And what about your past struggles with school and friendships? Do you feel like you've moved on from that?\nClassmates A: Definitely. It's been a journey, but I've worked hard to overcome those obstacles. And now I feel like I'm finally on the right path. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n2. Classmates A is looking forward to meeting up with Classmates B again after getting better sleep.\n3. Classmate A and Classmate B both enjoy socializing and going out to parties together.\n4.

In reaction, Classmates A agreed to try the suggestion and thanked Classmates B for it, wanting Classmates B to encourage them to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n\nClassmate A suggests planning a picnic in the park or a hike for the next outing with friends, and both Classmates A and B plan to relax at home later in the day. They both want to meet up again after getting better sleep, with Classmates B suggesting going back to school or taking courses to improve.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides relevant information about Classmates A and B's dynamics regarding making new friends and emphasizes mutual support, which might be useful given Classmates B's inquiry into Classmates A's struggles. It also touches on future plans and shared activities, which align with the theme of the dialogue. MEMORY 1, while containing some relevant points, introduces aspects (socializing, karaoke) that are unrelated to the immediate context of overcoming past struggles and future planning.\n\nChoice: 2"
