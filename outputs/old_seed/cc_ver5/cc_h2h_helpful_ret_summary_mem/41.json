Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking?\nCo-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for asking me to join you. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Co-worker B is supportive and encouraging towards Co-worker A.\n2. Co-worker B reassures Co-worker A and encourages them to have more confidence.\n3. Co-worker B reminds Co-worker A of their progress and potential for success.\n4. Co-workers A and B have worked together on a big story in the past.\n5. Co-worker B has moved on from their arrest and appreciates Co-worker A's concern and change in behavior.\n6. Co-worker B points out that Co-worker A doesn't always consider how their actions can affect others.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nCo-worker A has made mistakes in the past but is trying to be more aware of their actions, which has led Co-worker B to move on from their arrest and appreciate Co-worker A's concern and change in behavior. As a result, Co-worker B is supportive and encouraging towards Co-worker A. Co-worker A is trying to be more conscious of how their actions impact others and avoid causing problems for anyone else, prompting Co-worker B to reassure them that making mistakes is okay as long as they learn from them. This reassurance from Co-worker B also encourages Co-worker A to have more confidence. Additionally, Co-worker B mentions that Co-worker A is responsible in their work, even if not always in other aspects of life, and reminds them of their progress and potential for success.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is focused on Co-workers A and B planning to have lunch together. There is no mention of any past mistakes or issues, so most of the details about reassurances, arrests, or mistakes are not directly relevant to the immediate context of lunch plans. However, knowing that Co-worker B is supportive and encouraging (as noted in both memories) could slightly influence the tone of their interaction, given the positive nature of the invitation. Thus, MEMORY 1, which lists this information in a straightforward manner, avoids overcomplicating the context with unrelated details and maintains focus on their supportive dynamic.\n\nChoice: 1"
