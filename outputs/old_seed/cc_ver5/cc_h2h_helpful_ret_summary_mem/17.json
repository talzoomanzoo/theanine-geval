    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is centered on Neighbors A unexpectedly becoming a millionaire due to an inheritance. The topic doesn't involve career changes or job satisfaction, but rather is about the surprise and impact of inheriting a large amount of money. MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 both focus on Neighbors A's recent career change and how Neighbors B has been supportive of it, which is not directly relevant to the topic of the dialogue context, which is inheritance. Both memories discuss a career change, which doesn't help Neighbors B respond to Neighbors A's newfound wealth and inheritance.\n\nChoice: tie"
