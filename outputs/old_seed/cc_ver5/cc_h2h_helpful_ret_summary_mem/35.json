    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue focuses on the mutual support and importance of helping each other. MEMORY 1 contains multiple mentions of support and helpful gestures (e.g., help with the apology process), which align well with the theme of being there for each other. Although both memories contain the theme of neighbors supporting one another, MEMORY 1 provides a broader context with more relevant details about mutual support outside of just purchasing a necklace.\n\nChoice: 1"
