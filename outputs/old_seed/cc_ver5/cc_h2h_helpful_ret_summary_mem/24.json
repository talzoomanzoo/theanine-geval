Both neighbors emphasize the importance of taking care of each other as neighbors.\n2. Neighbors A offers to help Neighbors B with getting into a workout routine.\n3. Neighbor A enjoys reading and sharing books with Neighbor B.\n4. Neighbors B offers to be more supportive and check in on Neighbors A more often.\n5. Neighbors A believes in setting goals, developing a positive attitude, and taking action for personal development and career advancement.\n6. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's career advancement and expresses interest in borrowing the personal development book.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nNeighbor A enjoys reading and sharing books with Neighbor B, which recently led to Neighbors A getting a new job as a secretary at a small marketing agency. This new job eventually caused Neighbors A to be promoted to manager and take on more responsibilities, leading to them feeling overwhelmed and stressed with a lot on their plate.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is about clearly marking property boundaries between the neighbors. The relevant memory should address or relate to the current issue of boundary clarification either directly or with pertinent context that helps understand the situation. MEMORY 2 mentions a new job and potential stress for Neighbor A, which could have relevance in terms of Neighbor A's current mindset or approach to dealing issues, though it does not directly address the boundary matter or how they are cooperating on such issues. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, presents various aspects of their relationship, like setting goals and developing attitudes, which might suggest a context of resolving issues or setting boundaries, but it doesn't directly tie into the boundary matter either.\n\nChoice: tie"
