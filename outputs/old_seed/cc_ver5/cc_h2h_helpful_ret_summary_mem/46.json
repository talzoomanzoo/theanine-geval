    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Classmates B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, how are you feeling today?\nClassmates B: I'm feeling frustrated. I wish I could do things on my own.\nClassmates A: I understand how you feel. It can be tough when you feel like you're dependent on others.\nClassmates B: Yeah, exactly. I don't want to be a burden on anyone.\nClassmates A: You're not a burden, don't worry. And I'm always here to help you out.\nClassmates B: I appreciate that, but I don't want to always rely on others. I want to be more independent.\nClassmates A: I get it. Maybe there are some small things you can do on your own to start feeling more independent?\nClassmates B: Like what?\nClassmates A: Well, maybe you can start by making a list of things you'd like to do on your own and we can work on achieving those goals together. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Classmates A and B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as evidenced by their conversation about their respective experiences.\n2. Classmates B finds it awesome that Classmates A is pursuing their passion for music after a conversation they had about following dreams.\n3. Classmates A enjoys reminiscing about childhood memories, particularly about playing on swings and making music with friends.\n4. Classmates B is interested in learning to play an instrument.\n5. Classmates A and B enjoy jamming together and plan to collaborate on music in the future.\n6. Classmates A and B are both keeping up with the homework in their math class.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Classmates A and B enjoy playing music together, as they have a friendly and supportive relationship.\n2. Classmates A and B find it awesome to pursue their passions after a conversation about following dreams.\n3. Classmates A and B both enjoy reminiscing about childhood memories, including playing on swings and making music with friends.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context revolves around Classmates B's desire to become more independent and the support Classmates A offers. Neither memory directly addresses the specific topic of independence, but both describe a supportive relationship that could be useful in affirming the support Classmate A offers to B. MEMORY 1, however, provides additional context (not entirely related) about Classmates B's interest in learning to play an instrument, which might suggest an area of pursuit for independence. Still, the immediate context of the conversation doesn't involve music or the shared activities described in either memory.\n\nChoice: tie"
