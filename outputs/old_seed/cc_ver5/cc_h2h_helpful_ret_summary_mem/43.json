    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context involves a conversation about whether Classmates B can disclose information about Classmates A's past. MEMORY 1 provides some context about the relationship between the two classmates and safety advice, but it doesn't directly tie into the topic of disclosure or past information. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, while still not directly addressing the topic of past information, is more specific about the dynamic between the two. It includes the fact that Classmates A was nervous about fitting in, which could be relevant to past events or circumstances. Therefore, while neither memory directly addresses the disclosure question, MEMORY 2 offers more insight or potential relevant context about Classmate A's personal history and their relationship with Classmate B.\n\nChoice: 2"
