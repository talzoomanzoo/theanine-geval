Where do you want to go?\nHusband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city.\nWife: Oh, that sounds like a perfect idea! It will be nice to have some peace and quiet for a change.\nHusband: Yes, and we could cook our meals together, go for a hike, and just relax. What do you think?\nWife: That sounds lovely, husband. I'm really looking forward to it.\nHusband: Great. I'll start looking for rental cabins right away. I know this may sound impulsive, but I'm really excited to make this happen. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses on the husband's impulsive initiative to plan a weekend getaway and the wife's supportive response. MEMORY 2 provides context about how the husband's motivation is driven by his wife's inspiration, their commitment to each other, and their strategies for ensuring alignment, which is directly relevant to the dialogue. MEMORY 1, although it mentions the wife's encouragement, includes an unrelated point about the husband leaving without her, which does not fit the current context.\n\nChoice: 2"
