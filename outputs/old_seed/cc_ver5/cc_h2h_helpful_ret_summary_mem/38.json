    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides details about the supportive and trusting nature of their relationship, emphasizing the courage and strength shown by both classmates in sharing secrets. This is relevant as Classmate A just opened up about their feelings and concerns about potentially losing the friendship, so the highlight of support and trust is pertinent. MEMORY 2, while containing similar elements of support and advice, focuses more on their experiences with a group project and Classmates A's personal standards, which are less directly connected to the emotional conversation happening in the dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 1"
