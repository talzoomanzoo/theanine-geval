Co-worker A has grown and become more confident over the years.\n3. Co-worker B acknowledges and supports Co-worker A's growth and progress.\n4.

    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 emphasizes Co-worker A's aspirations towards leadership, Co-worker B's encouragement, and the importance of communication, which aligns with Co-worker A's recent promotion to product managerâ€”a role that typically involves leadership and communication skills. This makes Memory 1 more relevant to the dialogue about Co-worker A's new role and responsibilities. Memory 2 focuses more on emotions and their relationship, which is less directly connected to the context of the promotion and the responsibilities that come with it.\n\nChoice: 1"
