    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Neighbor A enjoys building houses and finishing them quickly.\n2. Neighbor A started construction on the house last week and plans to finish it in record time.\n3. Neighbor B reminds Neighbor A of their potential to do good things, referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them.\n4. Neighbor A considers using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder.\n5. Neighbor B is looking forward to seeing the finished house and is excited about the new project.\n6. Neighbor B is against Neighbor A's idea, emphasizing the ethical and legal implications.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nNeighbor A's enjoyment of building houses and finishing them quickly has led to their interest in taking care of flowers, finding it calming. This interest contrasts with their belief in making money without hurting anyone by covering their tracks carefully. Additionally, Neighbor A's current project to build a new house for Neighbor B is causing them to struggle with focus due to the looming deadline. However, Neighbor B's reminders of Neighbor A's potential to do good things, based on a previous house they built, have sparked a desire in Neighbor A to believe in the positive effects of providing sunlight, water, and love to plants.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains information about Neighbor A's enthusiasm for building and the support Neighbor B provides, reminding Neighbor A of their potential and past achievements. This is directly relevant to the situation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Neighbor A struggles to focus. In contrast, MEMORY 2 introduces additional details about interests in flowers and ethical considerations, which are less directly pertinent to resolving Neighbor A's immediate problem with procrastination and lack of focus.\n\nChoice: 1"
