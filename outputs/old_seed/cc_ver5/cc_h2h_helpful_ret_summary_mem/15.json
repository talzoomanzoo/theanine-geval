    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just tried this breathing exercise and it really helped me relax.\nNeighbors B: What kind of breathing exercise?\nNeighbors A: It's just a simple one, where you inhale for four seconds, hold your breath for seven seconds, and then exhale for eight seconds. I've been doing it every day for the past week and it's made such a difference.\nNeighbors B: That's really interesting. I've heard that breathing exercises can be really helpful for reducing stress and anxiety.\nNeighbors A: Yes, it definitely has helped me with that. Plus, it's something that I can easily do anywhere, whether I'm at home or out running errands.\nNeighbors B: That's great. It's always good to have a simple tool like that to help manage stress.  \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Neighbor B reassures Neighbor A about past embarrassing incidents and emphasizes their current friendship.\n2. Neighbors A is willing to take things slow in their relationship with Neighbors B.\n3. Neighbors A did this as a gesture of appreciation for Neighbors B's actions in the neighborhood.\n4. Neighbors B values their friendship with Neighbors A.\n5. Neighbor A and Neighbor B found a park together a couple of years ago and enjoyed playing frisbee and having a picnic.\n6. Both neighbors enjoy discovering new things in their neighborhood and spending time with their children.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nNeighbor A surprised Neighbor B with a pizza as a gesture of appreciation for Neighbor B's actions in the neighborhood. This surprised Neighbor B and both neighbors appreciated their friendship and are open to going back to being friends if the romantic relationship doesn't work out. Additionally, Neighbor B reassures Neighbor A about past embarrassing incidents and emphasizes their current friendship. \nNeighbor A went to the park with their son, who had a great time, caused by their gesture of appreciation for Neighbor B's actions in the neighborhood. It's similar to when Neighbor A and Neighbor B found a park together a couple of years ago and enjoyed playing frisbee and having a picnic.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither of the memories directly addresses the discussion about breathing exercises and stress management. Both memories predominantly focus on the appreciation and friendship dynamics between Neighbors A and B. However, Memory 1 broadly mentions appreciating Neighbor B's actions and the friendship, which are aspects that slightly touch on personal well-being by emphasizing support and friendship during stressful times, albeit indirectly. Memory 2, on the other hand, gives a more detailed account of a specific event (pizza surprise) and a past outing, but it still does not connect directly to stress relief or breathing exercises.\n\nChoice: tie"
