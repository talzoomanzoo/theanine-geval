It's still sinking in, to be honest.\nNeighbors B: That's amazing, congratulations!

    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is about Neighbors A having recently become a millionaire and discussing what they're planning to do with the money, including potentially investing it. The most relevant memory should provide information that can contribute to this particular conversation about inheritance, money management, and investment. Neither MEMORY 1 nor MEMORY 2 directly addresses these topics, but MEMORY 1 mentions that Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors Aâ€™s decisions, which could imply support in financial decisions as well. However, both memories largely focus on past support in career changes.\n\nChoice: tie"
