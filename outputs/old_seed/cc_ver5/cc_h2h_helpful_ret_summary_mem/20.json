    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides more relevant insight into the current dialogue context where Neighbors A has lost their temper due to work-related stress. It emphasizes the supportive relationship between Neighbors A and B, which aligns with Neighbors B offering understanding and concern about how Neighbors A is feeling. MEMORY 2, although it mentions mutual support and community sensibility, focuses more on a specific scenario involving a tree house and rearranging a living room, which is not directly relevant to the current dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 1"
