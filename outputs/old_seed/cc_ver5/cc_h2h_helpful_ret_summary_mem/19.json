    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains a clear, concise, and relevant piece of information indicating that Neighbors B is supportive and understanding of Neighbors A's mistake, which directly relates to the dialogue context where Neighbor A is apologetic for losing their temper. The specific memory of mutual support between them also strengthens the relevance. MEMORY 2 contains more information but mostly repeats the themes already expressed in MEMORY 1 without adding new relevant details to the current context, thus not enhancing the helpfulness.\n\nChoice: 1"
