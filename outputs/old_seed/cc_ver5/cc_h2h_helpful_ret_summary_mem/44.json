I thought we were happy together.\nNeighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1.

Neighbor A and Neighbor B have a close friendship and have shared memories of spending time together in the park.\n4. Neighbor B is offering support and companionship to Neighbor A during their difficult time.\n5. Neighbor A and Neighbor B are neighbors who catch up outside of their neighborhood.\n6. Neighbor A recently moved to a new neighborhood and feels safer and happier there.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nNeighbor A recently moved to a new neighborhood and feels safer and happier there. This change led to Neighbor A appreciating the emotional support and understanding from Neighbor B during their time of grief. Neighbor A was tired of living in a run-down apartment complex, which caused them and Neighbor B to become neighbors who catch up outside of their neighborhood. Furthermore, Neighbor B's mention of the affluent neighborhood made Neighbor A want to go for walks, leading to both neighbors enjoying walks together, especially to the park. Their shared love for the park has strengthened their close friendship, with shared memories of spending time together there.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 contains specific details about Neighbor A's appreciation for Neighbor B's support and the grief over their grandmother, which is directly relevant to the context of Neighbor A feeling abandoned and needing support. Memory 2, while detailing the history and activities of the neighbors, lacks focus on Neighbor A's immediate emotional situation and response to being left by a partner. \n\nChoice: 1"
