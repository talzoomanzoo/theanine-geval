Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking?\nCo-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for asking me to join you. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Support and encouragement', 'Related Summaries': 'Co-workers B reassures Co-workers A about handling new responsibilities and encourages self-belief.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Co-workers A: Okay, thanks for the advice. You know, speaking of mistakes, I still feel terrible about what happened a few years ago with your arrest. ### Co-workers B: It's okay, I've moved on from that. But I do appreciate your concern. ### Co-workers A: I just wish I had thought about how my actions would affect you. I've been trying to be more responsible and considerate since then. ### Co-workers B: I've noticed the change in you, and I appreciate it. We all make mistakes, but it's important to take responsibility for our actions and try to do better.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nCo-workers A: Hi there, I was wondering if you'd like to join me for lunch on Tuesday at the school cafeteria. ###Co-workers B: Oh, sure.

As a result, Co-worker B is supportive and encouraging towards Co-worker A. Co-worker A is trying to be more conscious of how their actions impact others and avoid causing problems for anyone else, prompting Co-worker B to reassure them that making mistakes is okay as long as they learn from them. This reassurance from Co-worker B also encourages Co-worker A to have more confidence. Additionally, Co-worker B mentions that Co-worker A is responsible in their work, even if not always in other aspects of life, and reminds them of their progress and potential for success.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 convey similar information about the relationship between Co-workers A and B, emphasizing themes of support, encouragement, and personal growth. However, the current dialogue context simply involves arranging a lunch meeting, and there's no explicit discussion of past mistakes or the need for reassurance. Therefore, neither memory is particularly relevant or necessary to respond to the immediate context of planning lunch. \n\nChoice: tie"
