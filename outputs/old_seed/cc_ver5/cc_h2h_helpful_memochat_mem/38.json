    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 focuses on trust issues that were resolved between Classmates A and B. This is directly relevant as they are considering transitioning from friendship to a romantic relationship and trust is a crucial component of any relationship. MEMORY 2 highlights the supportive nature of their friendship during a group project and Classmates A's reluctance to compromise on standards, which while positive, is less directly pertinent to the immediate concerns about transitioning their relationship and potential fears of emotional hurt.\n\nChoice: 1"
