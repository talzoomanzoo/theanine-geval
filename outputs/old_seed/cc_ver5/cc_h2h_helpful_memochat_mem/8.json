    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 is more relevant to the current Dialogue Context because it directly addresses Classmates A's progress on past struggles and their journey towards self-improvement, as previously discussed. Classmates A has expressed overcoming past obstacles related to school and friendships and is on the right path now. Memory 1 relates to these themes and discussions and provides insights into Classmates A's past regrets about school performance and the possibility of seeking help for self-improvement. This allows Classmates B to respond supportively in the context of Classmates A's journey. On the other hand, Memory 2 does not provide any direct connection to the ongoing conversation about self-improvement and overcoming past struggles, making it less helpful in this context.\n\nChoice: 1"
