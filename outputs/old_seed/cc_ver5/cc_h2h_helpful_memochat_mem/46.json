    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context reveals that Classmates B is feeling frustrated and desires more independence. They want to achieve goals on their own instead of relying on others. Memory 1 primarily provides context about Classmates A's experience with learning to play the guitar, which is not directly related to Classmates B's current situation, but it could be helpful if the idea is to suggest a new skill to learn independently. Memory 2, while highlighting a supportive relationship and common interests in music, does not provide specific actions or examples of achieving independence, which is what Classmates B is seeking.\n\nChoice: 1"
