    "prediction": "Explanation: The information in both Memory 1 and Memory 2 is about Neighbors A wanting a career change, which isn't directly relevant to the current context of inheriting wealth from a relative. However, Memory 1 goes more into the dialogue and specific offers from Neighbors B, providing context on their relationship and communication style that could be more useful to draw upon. Memory 2 summarizes similar information but does not offer additional utility for responding to the current conversation topic about inheritance.\n\nChoice: 1"
