This has led to the husband being excited about his progress on long-awaited plans and putting in a lot of effort to make them a reality. As a result, the husband and wife are committed to each other and excited about their future together. Their discussion of setting specific times for updates on progress and waiting for each other for certain events to avoid similar situations is a way to ensure they are on the same page.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 is more focused on the aspect of the husband's excitement and the wife's supportive role, which directly correlates with the husband's enthusiasm about planning the getaway and the wife's positive response. This MEMORY highlights the wife's support, which is relevant in the context of planning the trip and shows how they work together towards shared goals. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 discusses the couple's commitment and future excitement broadly, but doesn't directly connect to the context of planning the getaway or address the husband's last expression of excitement.\n\nChoice: 1"
