Classmates A and B both emphasize the significance of exploring new opportunities and embracing risks for personal growth.\n2. Classmates B's encouragement led Classmates A to venture beyond their comfort zone and seek personal development, aligning with A's desire to lead a fulfilling life independently.\n3. Both Classmates A and B stress the value of prioritizing personal happiness and remaining true to oneself despite external criticisms.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 specifically addresses elements that are directly relevant to the conversation, such as encouragement, exploring new opportunities, and personal growth, all of which are key parts of the dialogue context where Classmates B supports Classmates A's journey in pursuing the arts. This is more helpful for Classmates B to continue responding on these encouragement-related themes. MEMORY 1, while it touches on life updates and personal happiness, does not provide the same level of directly relevant insights pertained to the immediate conversation about pursuing passions and bravery, which are central to the dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 2"
