This reminds Co-worker B of the time when Co-worker A was a leader in their country, making it prosperous and safe.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides specific and relevant information that directly aligns with the dialogue context concerning Co-worker A's efforts at being more responsible and reliable. It reinforces the narrative of Co-worker A's past leadership and connects it to their current habits, maintaining coherence with the dialogueâ€™s flow about personal improvement and recognition of past successes. MEMORY 1, while also relevant, is more general and doesn't offer as smooth a connection or as direct a link to the manifestation of Co-worker A's personal improvement efforts as MEMORY 2 does.\n\nChoice: 2"
