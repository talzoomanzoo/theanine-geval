    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit.\nNeighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water.\nNeighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it.\nNeighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again.\nNeighbors A: I won't. So, do you remember the time when I mowed the lawn with that old push mower?\nNeighbors B: Yeah, I remember that. That was pretty tough work.\nNeighbors A: It was. But it was also a good workout.\nNeighbors B: I prefer to work out indoors where there's air conditioning. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nUser Description: Neighbors B is a busy individual who manages to make time for hobbies and friends, suggesting cooking as a hobby. They enjoy spending time with family and work that keeps them occupied. Neighbors B has a cozy home where they enjoy relaxing and hosting gatherings. They value good neighbors and have become good friends with Neighbors A over the years.\n\nRelationship Description: Neighbors A and Neighbors B have developed a close friendship, with Neighbors A expressing a desire to spend more time with Neighbors B. They have shared memories of working together on tasks like mowing the lawn and enjoy spending time together, even suggesting hanging out once a week to watch a movie, grab coffee, and talk.\n\nEvent Description: Neighbors A and Neighbors B have planned to make homemade pizzas together and host a monthly dinner party, rotating hosting duties and inviting other neighbors to join. They have also discussed starting a community tradition together. The two neighbors have shared moments of bonding over chores and activities, showing a willingness to support each other and enjoy each other's company.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nNeighbors A and B initially wanted to spend more time together as they didn't know each other well. Now, they are on friendly terms and enjoy spending time together. Additionally, both neighbors enjoy spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn. As a result, Neighbor B agrees that mowing the lawn is a lot of work but acknowledges the exercise it provides. Furthermore, they plan to hang out once a week, possibly watching a movie, getting coffee, or just talking. This indicates that Neighbors A and B have not seen each other in a while and are catching up. Moreover, Neighbor A mentioned mowing the lawn with an old push mower, suggesting they are responsible for the yard work. This is related to Neighbor A feeling pressured to look perfect all the time by their mom, who scolds them for ripping off the tag from their new shirt.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context centers around a playful argument between the neighbors, followed by a diversion to recollection of shared chores like mowing the lawn. The focus should be on the context of mowing the lawn and their relationship dynamics. MEMORY 1 provides relevant context about their shared activities, mutual support in tasks like mowing the lawn, and plans to do more activities together. It indicates their close friendship, shared tasks, and potential for hosting dinner parties, which is helpful in reinforcing the camaraderie and collaborative activities. While MEMORY 2 provides similar information about the lawn mowing and social activities, it introduces unrelated information about Neighbor A's feelings toward their mom, which is not contextual to the dialogue. Thus, MEMORY 1 is more directly helpful and aligned with the dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 1"
