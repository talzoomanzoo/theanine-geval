    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 focuses more on the positive relationship and the encouragement between the two classmates, as well as their shared optimism, but it doesn't directly connect to the given dialogue context of not being able to disclose information. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, provides relevant context about the discussions on safety and the positive mindset between the classmates. It hints at a possible reason for Classmates B's reluctance to share certain information due to their care and concern about safety and the influence of past discussions. Therefore, MEMORY 2 is more helpful because it gives context that can explain Classmates B's response to not disclosing information.\n\nChoice: 2"
