    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Classmates A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I need to talk to you about something important.\nClassmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\nClassmates A: I know about your affair with that other woman.\nClassmates B: What are you talking about? I don't have an affair with anyone.\nClassmates A: Don't lie to me! I saw you together at the restaurant last week.\nClassmates B: That was just a business meeting. We were discussing a potential collaboration on a music project. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nUser Description:\nClassmates B is a high school student who is interested in biology but has not studied it in depth. They admire Classmates A's hard work and passion for science. Classmates B is open to discovering new passions and enjoys talking to Classmates A. They are impressed by Classmates A's dedication to balancing high school and college classes.\n\nRelationship Description:\nClassmates A and Classmates B have a friendly and supportive relationship. Classmates A admires Classmates B's potential and encourages them to pursue their interests. Classmates B appreciates Classmates A's hard work and dedication.\n\nEvent Description:\nClassmates A invited Classmates B to grab lunch together, which Classmates B agreed to.

They both enjoy talking to each other while balancing school and family responsibilities.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The current dialogue context revolves around a significant personal conflict between Classmates A and B regarding an alleged affair. MEMORY 2 is more useful and relevant because it mentions Classmates A's interest in biology, Classmates B's potential interest in taking biology classes, and their mutual admiration for Lady Gaga's song \"Born This Way\". Although this might not directly resolve the conflict, it provides a potential common ground or distraction both classmates share, which could help in easing the tension. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, focuses more on general interests and past friendly interactions that are less relevant to resolving the current issue. Thus, MEMORY 2 provides more contextual substance for Classmates A to potentially navigate the situation or defuse the confrontation by highlighting shared interests.\n\nChoice: 2"
