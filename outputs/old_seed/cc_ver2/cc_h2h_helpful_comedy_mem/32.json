    "prediction": "Explanation: In the dialogue context, Classmates A expresses a strong sense of honor and feeling of something special within the class, which might be related to their connection or shared activities with Classmates B. MEMORY 2 provides a broader context of Classmates A's interests, emotions, and the dynamic between Classmates A and B, including shared experiences and mutual appreciation. This gives Classmates B ample context to respond to Classmates A's current sentiment about feeling honored and can engage in topics of shared interest, such as their friendship and past activities, which are detailed in the memory. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, limits itself to a specific situation—a romantic confession and subsequent reaction—and doesn't encompass the broader context or shared special connection that might be relevant to the current dialogue. \n\nChoice: 2"
