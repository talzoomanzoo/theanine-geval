    "prediction": "Explanation: The last utterance in the dialogue context is about a funny memory involving Classmates A wearing pajamas to school. Memory 1 directly addresses this by explaining the reason Classmates A wore pajamas, linking it to the broader theme of dedication to studying. Memory 2, on the other hand, provides information about their relationship, goals, and ambitions but doesnâ€™t directly connect to the specific memory discussed in Classmates A's last comment. Therefore, Memory 1 is more helpful as it offers relevant context that directly relates to the conversation at hand.\n\nChoice: 1"
