Have you thought about any specific ways you could use your language skills?\nStudent: I would love to be able to travel more and speak with the locals in their native language. Maybe I could even teach my grandchildren some basic phrases. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nThe student wants to become more well-rounded by studying French at college and plans on learning Spanish and German as well. The teacher speaks Spanish and French fluently.\nThe teacher's encouragement to prioritize safety and continue helping others in need caused the student to mention feeling stressed lately, which may have led to the outburst.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a more comprehensive context about the student's proactive nature, openness to learning, and future language learning plans. It also describes the supportive relationship between the student and teacher, which is relevant for the conversation about the student's aspirations to travel and teach their grandchildren. MEMORY 1 includes specific details about visiting more often and the teacher's encouragement, but it doesn't directly relate to the student's language learning or travel goals discussed in the dialogue context. Therefore, MEMORY 2 offers more useful and relevant information.\n\nChoice: 2"
