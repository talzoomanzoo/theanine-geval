    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 contains more relevant and useful information regarding the supportive and understanding relationship between the teacher and the student. This information can directly relate to the conversation about enjoying the sensation of hot sauce. The teacher's caring nature and tendency to offer support and reassurance can contextualize the teacher's response and provide insight into the relationship dynamic. MEMORY 1, while containing some overlapping elements, focuses more on stress and an outburst, which seems less relevant to the specific topic of discussion about spicy food and the current emotional dynamic conveyed.\n\nChoice: 2"
