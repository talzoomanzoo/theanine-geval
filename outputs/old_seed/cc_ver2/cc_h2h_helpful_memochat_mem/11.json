    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a more focused account of a past apology, reconciliation, and the commitment to maintaining a strong friendship. It aligns well with the dialogue context where Neighbors A reflects on taking responsibility and not repeating past mistakes. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, includes unrelated discussions about environmental care, which may dilute the focus on the apology relevant in the current context.\n\nChoice: 2"
