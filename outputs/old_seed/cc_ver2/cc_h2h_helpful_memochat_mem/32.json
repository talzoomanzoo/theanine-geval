    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides specific and directly related context about a situation involving Classmate A and Classmate B. It offers insight into Classmate B's thoughts and feelings about their friendship and how they reacted to Classmate A's romantic confession. This contextual background can help Classmate B respond to the dialogue context appropriately, perhaps by acknowledging Classmate A's sentiments about class unity or by expressing gratitude for their friendship. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 lacks any specific or useful information about Classmate A or B's past interactions or feelings that could help Classmate B respond effectively to the current dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 1"
