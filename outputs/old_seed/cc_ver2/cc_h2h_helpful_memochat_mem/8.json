That's incredible! ### Neighbors A: Yeah, it's been a little overwhelming actually. But it's also really exciting. ### Neighbors B: I can imagine! Have you been practicing? ### Neighbors A: A little bit. I mean, it's not like I can toss cars around or anything, but I can move small things pretty easily. ### Neighbors B: That's still really cool. Can you show me? ### Neighbors A: Sure, let me see if I can move that salt shaker over there. ### Neighbors B: Woah, it moved! ### Neighbors A: Yeah, it's not much, but it's a start. ### Neighbors B: I'm excited to see what else you can do with it.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nNeighbors A: Hey, can you keep a secret? ###Neighbors B: Of course, what's up? ###Neighbors A: I can't be seen because I am hiding from my mom behind the door. ###Neighbors B: Oh, why are you hiding from her? ### \n\n``` Neighbors B Input:\nRecent Dialogs: Neighbors A: Hey, can you keep a secret? ###Neighbors B: Of course, what's up? ###Neighbors A: I can't be seen because I am hiding from my mom behind the door. ###Neighbors B: Oh, why are you hiding from her? ### \n\n``` Neighbors B Input:\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The aim is to choose the memory that is most relevant to the conversation about Neighbor A hiding from their mom. MEMORY 1 discusses telekinetic abilities and feelings about Neighbor A's job, which do not relate to the situation of hiding from their mom. MEMORY 2 also centers around telekinetic abilities, stemming from a different context concerning a dinner, and it lacks direct relevance to the current scenario. Neither memory directly addresses why Neighbor A is hiding from their mom, making both memories equally unhelpful for providing a contextual response.\n\nChoice: tie"
