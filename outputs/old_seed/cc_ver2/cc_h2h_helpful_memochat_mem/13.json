I've seen how people trust you with important projects because they know you'll get it done right. ### Co-workers A: That's the goal. And I actually really enjoy being able to help people out, too. ### Co-workers B: It's a great quality to have. You make the workplace better for everyone when you're always willing to lend a hand. ### Co-workers A: I think it just comes down to having a good work ethic. You know, it's important to take pride in what you do. ### Co-workers B: Absolutely. And I think that's something that rubs off on other people, too. When they see how much effort you put in, it motivates them to do the same. ### Co-workers A: Yeah, it's all about leading by example. And hopefully, it creates a positive culture where everyone strives to do their best. ### Co-workers A: Hey, I'm glad I could return your watch to you.
