Besides, I'm good at manipulating people and getting what I want. ### Neighbors B: I can't support this. It's wrong and you're better than that. Remember when you built me that amazing house? You have so much potential to do good things with your skills. ### Neighbors A: I know, I know. I just need to think this through more. Maybe I can use my manipulation skills for good instead of evil.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus. ### \n\n``` Neighbors A Input:\nRecent Dialogs: Neighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus. ### \n\n``` Neighbors A Input:\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
