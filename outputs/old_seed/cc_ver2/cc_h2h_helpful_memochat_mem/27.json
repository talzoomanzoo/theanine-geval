This enhances the relevance and utility of his actions (hanging lights and candles) and his intent to create a warm atmosphere. MEMORY 1, meanwhile, veers off into details about his support system and faith, which do not directly relate to the act of decorating their home for coziness.\n\nChoice: 2"
