    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 focuses on the Mentor's ongoing support and praise for the Menteeâ€™s impact, as well as thoughts on gender equality, none of which directly connect to the current context of feelings of loneliness and transitioning into a new city. MEMORY 2, although also not directly related to loneliness, shows examples of how the Mentor has provided advice and emotional support during stressful times, like college applications, which is more aligned with offering support and practical suggestions for dealing with emotional challenges.\n\nChoice: 2"
