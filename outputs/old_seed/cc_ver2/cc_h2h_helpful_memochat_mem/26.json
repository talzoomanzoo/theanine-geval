    "prediction": "Explanation: The key point within the dialogue context is the reference to Co-worker A's investigative ability to discover Co-worker B's marital status and how that played into their surprise. This relates heavily to MEMORY 2, which specifically recounts the moment Co-worker A confronted Co-worker B about their marriage after discovering it through observation and research. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, introduces additional details like payday, hiking, and dinners, which are unrelated and could distract from the main topic at hand.\n\nChoice: 2"
