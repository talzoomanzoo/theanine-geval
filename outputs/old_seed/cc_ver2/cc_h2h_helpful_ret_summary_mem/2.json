    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbors A and B started spending more time together, eventually becoming good friends who have known each other for years. They catch up frequently, reminiscing about past events and planning to hang out once a week. Neighbors A enjoys the support and comfort Neighbor B provides, while Neighbor B suggests cooking together and shows consideration by offering extra water for lawn mowing.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A.\n2. Neighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\n3. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n4. Neighbors A and B have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside.\n5. Neighbors A and B have not seen each other in a while and are catching up.\n6. Neighbor A's mom scolds them for ripping off the tag from their new shirt.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides a clear context for the relationship dynamic between Neighbors A and B as friends who frequently catch up and reminisce. This helps explain the playful but inconsiderate joke of being pushed into cold water. The emphasis on spending time together and showing consideration, like suggesting cooking together and offering extra water, aligns with Neighbor A's attempt to lighten the mood after the joke. MEMORY 2, although containing relevant points, includes additional details that are not directly useful for the current conversation and could potentially dilute the focus.\n\nChoice: 1"
