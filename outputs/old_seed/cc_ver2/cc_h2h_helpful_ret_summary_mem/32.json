I feel like we have something special going on here. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Classmate A confesses their love to Classmate B, who does not feel the same way. This leads to Classmate B appreciating Classmate A's honesty but not returning the romantic feelings.\n2. Classmate B plans to check their schedule to go to the mall with Classmate A.

Classmates A values their friendship with Classmates B and looks forward to wearing a black suit to a wedding reception.\n6. Classmates A is excited for a wedding reception and plans to dance with the bride.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: When evaluating which memory is more helpful, Memory 2 provides specific details that closely relate to friendships and appreciation, which are relevant to the dialogue context where Classmate A feels honored and special within the class. It suggests a history of honest communication and mutual respect that aligns with the sentiment expressed. Memory 1, while mentioning remaining friends, focuses more on a romantic confession which is less connected to the context of feeling honored as part of a class. Thus, Memory 2 provides richer context for a response connected to the feeling of honor and special bonds within the class.\n\nChoice: 2"
