I know this may sound impulsive, but I'm really excited to make this happen.\nWife: Don't worry, husband, it's not impulsive. You always follow through with your plans, and I believe this will be a wonderful experience for both of us.\nHusband: Thank you, wife. And, I want to apologize for the time I left without waiting for you. I know I promised to wait, and I should have kept my word.\nWife: It's okay, husband.

The husband is excited about his progress on long-awaited plans and is putting in a lot of effort to make them a reality.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The MEMORY that would be most helpful and relevant to the Wife in forming a response is one that captures the essence of the husband's apology and the current situation of planning the getaway. MEMORY 1 is concise and directly relates to the husband's realization of past mistakes and his commitment to involving the wife in plans, which is relevant to the ongoing discussion. MEMORY 2, while containing more details about the past situation, includes unnecessary information about the wife's past disappointment, which isn't needed for responding to the current dialogue context and might steer the conversation in an unintended direction.\n\nChoice: 1"
