It's a two-way street, and it's important to be there for each other.\nNeighbors A: I remember when I helped you move last year, and then you watched my cat when I went on vacation.\nNeighbors B: Yes, and I appreciate it so much. It's always nice to have someone you can count on. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbors A stumbled upon Neighbors B's shop while looking for a new necklace and received a suggestion. Neighbors A thanked Neighbors B for the help and now wants earrings for an upcoming wedding. Both neighbors discussed the challenge of not being able to adopt all animals they see but admire those who do, and also agreed on the strength required for apologizing.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbors A thanked Neighbors B for the suggestion.\n2. Neighbors B offered to help Neighbors A with the apology process.\n3. Both neighbors express the difficulty of not being able to adopt all the animals they see but appreciate those who do adopt and give them loving homes.\n4. Neighbors A bought a necklace from Neighbors B's shop and loves it.\n5. Neighbors B emphasized the importance of apologizing to show care for the relationship.\n6. Neighbors A was looking for a new necklace and stumbled upon Neighbors B's shop.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about mutual help and support between Neighbors A and B. MEMORY 1 provides detailed context about mutual actions of support (help with moving and pet-sitting), which are directly relevant to the conversation in the dialogue regarding mutual help and appreciation. MEMORY 2, however, focuses more on buying a necklace and the process of apologizing, neither of which directly ties back to the idea of mutual support illustrated in the dialogue. Therefore, MEMORY 1 is more relevant and helpful.\n\nChoice: 1"
