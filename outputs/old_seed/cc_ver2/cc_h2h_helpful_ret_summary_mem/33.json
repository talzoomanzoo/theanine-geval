But I needed to get this package sent out.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of packages, remember that time when you got stranded because you couldn't drive yourself home from a night out with friends?\nCo-workers A: Ugh, don't remind me. That was such a disaster.\nCo-workers B: It was definitely not one of your finest moments. But it's good to see that you're being responsible now and taking care of things like sending packages.\nCo-workers A: Thanks. I'm trying to be more responsible and reliable these days.\nCo-workers B: That's great to hear. It reminds me of the time when you were a great leader in your country. You were strong, determined, and made a positive impact.\nCo-workers A: Wow, that was a long time ago. But I appreciate the compliment. It's nice to be reminded of my successes. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nCo-worker B is supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable. This reminds Co-worker B of the time when Co-worker A was a leader in their country, making it prosperous and safe.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker B is supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable.\n2. Co-worker A was a leader in their country, making it prosperous and safe.\n3.

Co-worker A believes their success as a leader was due to determination and strength of character.\n6. Co-worker A is trying to be more responsible but still working on avoiding late nights out and expensive rides.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides a concise and relevant summary of Co-worker Bâ€™s supportive nature towards Co-worker A's efforts to be more responsible, directly linking it to the conversation about Co-worker A's past leadership. MEMORY 2, while it includes useful information, contains additional details that do not directly contribute to Co-worker B's ability to respond to the last utterance. The extra points in MEMORY 2, such as avoiding late nights out, are not immediately relevant to the compliment exchange related to Co-worker A's past leadership.\n\nChoice: 1"
