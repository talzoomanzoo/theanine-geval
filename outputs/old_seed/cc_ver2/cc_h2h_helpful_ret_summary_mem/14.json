    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Co-workers B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I'm the boss!\nCo-workers B: Yeah, we know. You don't have to remind us every five minutes.\nCo-workers A: I just want everything to go smoothly and according to plan.\nCo-workers B: I understand that, but it doesn't always have to be your way or the highway.\nCo-workers A: Well, I just think that my way is usually the best way.\nCo-workers B: And sometimes it is, but we all have different ideas and perspectives to bring to the table.\nCo-workers A: Okay, I see your point. I'll try to be more open-minded in the future. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- Co-worker A enjoys helping others and takes pride in their work, which leads to Co-worker A and Co-worker B excelling at working well with others and resolving issues. This results in Co-worker A giving Co-worker B a massage to help them relax.\n- Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace. Similarly, both Co-worker A and Co-worker B value communication and understanding in relationships, as well as enjoy taking moments to connect with each other to make work more enjoyable.\n- Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace, causing them to have a disagreement. However, they resolve it and become friends again, with Co-worker A returning Co-worker B's watch a few years ago being the cause of their rekindled friendship.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker A and Co-worker B excel at working well with others and resolving issues.\n2. Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace.\n3. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B value communication and understanding in relationships.\n4. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's competence and effort in their work.\n5. Co-worker A strives to do their best in their work.\n6. Co-worker A and Co-worker B had a disagreement but resolved it, becoming friends again.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a clear and concise list of information relevant to the dialogue context such as the fact that both co-workers excel at resolving issues and value communication. This is useful for Co-worker B's response because it highlights the potential for collaboration and understanding, directly connecting to the context about being open-minded and valuing different perspectives. In contrast, MEMORY 1 is more convoluted and includes irrelevant details like giving massages, which do not directly contribute to the current dialogue or help Co-worker B in formulating a response.\n\nChoice: 2"
