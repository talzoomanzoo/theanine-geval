    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context revolves around Neighbors A hiding from their mother and needing discretion, which is unrelated to the topic of telekinesis, cooking, or abilities discussed in either memory option. However, neither memory contains directly relevant information to the immediate context of hiding from a mother or the reasons for doing so, which makes them both equally irrelevant in providing helpfulness for the current conversation.\n\nChoice: tie"
