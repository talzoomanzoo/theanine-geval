    "prediction": "Explanation: To determine the more helpful MEMORY, we need to consider which one provides information relevant to understanding Neighbor A's current emotional state and the issue at hand, which is their frustration with their boss at work. MEMORY 1 largely focuses on activities related to maintaining a tree house and mutual support in physical activities, with no direct relevance to the emotions or work-related frustrations shared in the dialogue context. In contrast, MEMORY 2 highlights Neighbor B's supportive and understanding nature, as well as Neighbor A's appreciation for help and striving for perfection, which can be directly relevant to responding to Neighbor A's frustration with their boss. \n\nChoice: 2"
