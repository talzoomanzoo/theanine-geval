    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbor A started construction on the house last week and plans to finish it in record time. Neighbor A believes they can make a lot of money without hurting anyone and plans to cover their tracks carefully.\nNeighbor A enjoys building houses and finishing them quickly, which led them to help Neighbor B build a new house with amazing features. As a result, Neighbor A was able to complete the project quickly and Neighbor B received a new house built by Neighbor A, leaving them grateful for the extra space. \nNeighbor B is looking forward to seeing the finished house and is excited about the new project. This excitement stems from the help and quick completion of the new home provided by Neighbor A, for which Neighbor B is grateful.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbor B has not been up to anything interesting lately but is excited about the new house and looking forward to it.\n2. Neighbors A enjoys taking care of flowers and finds it calming.\n3. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's gardening skills and wishes to have a green thumb.\n4. Neighbors A had help from friends in building the new house.\n5. Neighbor B is against Neighbor A's idea, emphasizing the ethical and legal implications.\n6. Neighbor A has skills in manipulation and getting what they want.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context involves Neighbor A struggling to focus on completing a project before a deadline. MEMORY 1 provides relevant information about Neighbor A's ability to finish projects quickly and their history of successfully completing a project (building a house) with the help of Neighbor B. This could potentially offer Neighbor B an opportunity to encourage or remind Neighbor A about their past success and teamwork. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 does not directly relate to the current challenge Neighbor A is facing and offers less relevant context or supportive information to aid in their current situation.\n\nChoice: 1"
