I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends.\nMentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\nMentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here.\nMentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people.\nMentee: Those are good suggestions, Mentor. I'll consider joining a club or volunteering.\nMentor: And remember, it's also important to keep in touch with your old friends. You can schedule video calls or even plan a visit back home.\nMentee: That's true, I'll make sure to keep in touch. Thanks for the advice, Mentor.\nMentor: Anytime, Mentee.

The Mentee has been offered a job and has decided to take the job in the city.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is focused on the Mentee feeling lonely in a new city. The most relevant and helpful information in the memories would pertain to experience of dealing with new environments, decision-making, or coping strategies. Neither Memory 1 nor Memory 2 contains direct references to dealing with loneliness or making new social connections, but they both touch on decision-making and seeking guidance. However, Memory 2 includes the experience of Mentee taking a job in a city, which could be indirectly relevant to transitioning into a new environment and building a life there â€“ more directly relatable to the current state of Mentee. \n\nChoice: 2"
