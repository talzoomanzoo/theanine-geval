    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context involves a conversation about hot sauce and the student's reaction to it. MEMORY 2 is more helpful because it provides specific information that the teacher speaks Spanish and French fluently, which could be relevant if discussing cultural foods or languages associated with hot sauce. MEMORY 1 lacks this relevant detail and focuses mainly on the student's stress and past emergency situation, which is less applicable to the current dialogue about hot sauce enjoyment.\n\nChoice: 2"
