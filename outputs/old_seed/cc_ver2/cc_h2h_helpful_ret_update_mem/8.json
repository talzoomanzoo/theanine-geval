    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey, can you keep a secret?\nNeighbors B: Of course, what's up?\nNeighbors A: I can't be seen because I am hiding from my mom behind the door.\nNeighbors B: Oh, why are you hiding from her? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbors A and B are discussing the idea of having telekinetic abilities. Neighbors B is excited and supportive of Neighbors A's new ability. Neighbor A feels there is no room for growth or new projects at their current job. \nNeighbors A and B joke about the fun aspects of using telekinesis to surprise people.

Neighbors A and B are discussing the idea of having telekinetic abilities.\n4. Neighbors B expresses concerns about accidentally moving objects and causing unintended consequences.\n5. Neighbors A and B share a dream of developing telekinetic abilities together in the future.\n6. Neighbors A has been practicing moving small objects with their telekinesis.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 primarily focuses on the discussion about telekinetic abilities and mentions a work-related dissatisfaction, with no relevance to the current conversation about hiding from a parent. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 also mentions telekinetic abilities but includes no additional relevant context to the hiding situation. Both memories primarily reference telekinesis, which doesn't relate directly to the act of hiding from a parent, making them equally unhelpful in responding to Neighbors B's inquiry.\n\nChoice: tie"
