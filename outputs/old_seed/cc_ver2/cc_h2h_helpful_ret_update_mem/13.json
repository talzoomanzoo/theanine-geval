You don't have to remind us every five minutes.\nCo-workers A: I just want everything to go smoothly and according to plan.\nCo-workers B: I understand that, but it doesn't always have to be your way or the highway.\nCo-workers A: Well, I just think that my way is usually the best way. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Co-worker A enjoys helping others and takes pride in their work, which Co-worker B appreciates for Co-worker A's competence and effort.\n2. Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace, leading to Co-worker A and Co-worker B excelling at working well with others and resolving issues, and then Co-worker A giving Co-worker B a massage to help them relax.\n3. Co-worker A returned a watch to Co-worker B, making them happy again, just like how Co-worker A had a teddy bear received as a gift from their grandma that they used to carry everywhere.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker A and Co-worker B excel at working well with others and resolving issues.\n2. Co-worker A strives to do their best in their work.\n3. Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace.\n4. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's competence and effort in their work.\n5. Co-worker A is seen as competent and reliable by Co-worker B.\n6. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B value communication and understanding in relationships.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides relevant insights into the working dynamics and mutual appreciation between Co-workers A and B, highlighting their ability to resolve issues together and the value they place on communication and understanding. These points are directly applicable to the current dialogue context where communication and working together are being discussed. MEMORY 1, while containing some overlapping themes, includes less relevant information (such as the watch and teddy bear story) which does not directly connect with the dialogue context and adds unnecessary detail.\n\nChoice: 2"
