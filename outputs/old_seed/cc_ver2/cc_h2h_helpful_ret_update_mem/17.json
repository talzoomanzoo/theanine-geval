    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Classmates B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today.\nClassmates B:  That sounds great. What was the talk about?\nClassmates A: It was about the history of the pyramids in Egypt. I learned so much about their construction and the cultural significance they held.\nClassmates B: Wow, that does sound interesting. Did you take any notes?\nClassmates A: Yes, I took lots of notes. I'm excited to study this topic more on my own time. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nClassmates B is interested in attending a new technology conference next month. Classmates B noticed Classmates A's improvement and acknowledged their hard work. Classmates B is supportive of Classmates A's new relationship and believes they found someone who makes them happy.\nClassmates B is working on finishing a history project. Classmates A is dedicated to studying hard and taking extra classes to get into a good college. Classmates B advises Classmates A to consider how others perceive them, especially in situations like applying to college. \nClassmates A is willing to work hard to achieve their dreams. Classmates A met the girl of their dreams at a party and have been texting her nonstop.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Classmate B is working on finishing a history project.\n2. Classmates B noticed Classmates A's improvement and acknowledged their hard work.\n3. Classmate B is interested in attending a new technology conference next month.\n4. Classmates A's grades are looking good according to their teacher.\n5. Classmates A had a moment of frustration in the past but has learned to channel that energy into studies.\n6. Classmates B recalls a funny moment from high school involving Classmates A wearing pajamas to school.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: To determine which MEMORY is more helpful, we should look for information that allows Classmate B to engage with Classmate A in a meaningful and contextually appropriate way about the topic of pyramids and history. Since Classmate A attended a talk about the history of pyramids and has taken notes, anything related to history or supportive attributes in studying would be beneficial for the dialogue. \n\nMemory 1 mentions that Classmate B is working on finishing a history project. This piece of information is particularly relevant because it directly relates to the subject of history, which could enable Classmate B to engage further with Classmate A about their interest in pyramids. This connection can foster a deeper conversation about history, a shared interest.\n\nMemory 2 also mentions that Classmate B is working on a history project, which is useful. However, given the content of both memories, Memory 1 provides slightly more relevant context, such as Classmates A's dedication to studying. Meanwhile, Memory 2 includes an unrelated, humorous anecdote but doesn't add as much helpful context as Memory 1.\n\nChoice: 1"
