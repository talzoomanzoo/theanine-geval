    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT ends with a mention of Co-worker B's marital status and Co-worker A's discovery of it, which connects to the details about Co-worker A's observational skills and Co-worker B's surprise at that discovery. Both memories mention Co-worker A's detective-like skills and the surprise regarding Co-worker B's marital status. However, MEMORY 2 provides a more concise and directly related context: Co-worker A's observance and Co-worker B's surprise, and it gives a clear connection with their shared memories and past work experience, which is tangentially referenced in the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 2"
