I feel like we have something special going on here. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Classmate A confesses their love to Classmate B, who does not feel the same way.

Classmates A has been busy with work and hanging out with friends, looking forward to the wedding as a fun night out.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context involves Classmate A expressing a sentiment about feeling honored and special regarding their class. Memory 2 provides more context about the nature of Classmates A and B's relationship, including past feelings, attire for a wedding, and friendship dynamics. This information could be relevant to understanding and responding to Classmate A's current sentiment about the class dynamic. Memory 1 primarily focuses on a specific instance of a romantic confession and an arrangement to go to the mall, which is less directly related to the feeling of being honored in the class context.\n\nChoice: 2"
