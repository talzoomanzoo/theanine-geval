But I know I'm not imagining things! ### Co-workers B: Hmm, that does sound frustrating. Maybe you could try talking to our supervisor about it? ### Co-workers A: I don't know, I don't want to come across as a tattletale or a complainer. ### Co-workers B: I understand your hesitation, but if Mary's behavior is affecting your work, it's important to bring it up to someone who can address it. ### Co-workers A: You're right. I'll talk to our supervisor about it and see if there's anything we can do to resolve this.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nCo-workers A: I feel really fulfilled as a leader and guide.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains relevant information about co-worker A's and B's values regarding fulfillment, making a difference, and leadership, which aligns well with the current dialogue's themes of feeling fulfilled as a leader and helping others. MEMORY 2 is unrelated to the dialogue context as it discusses an issue with a third party's behavior and does not provide relevant information to help Co-workers A respond appropriately to the context about feeling fulfilled or guiding others.\n\nChoice: 1"
