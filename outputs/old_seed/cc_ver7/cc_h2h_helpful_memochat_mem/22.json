    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides context about previous interactions between Classmate A and Classmate B, specifically mentioning Classmate A's romantic confession and Classmate B's response. This background is useful for understanding the dynamics of their relationship, particularly in responding to expressions of appreciation or special bonds, which could relate to romantic or deep friendship feelings. In contrast, MEMORY 2 lacks any substantive context or specific interactions, merely echoing the initial statement without additional insight. \n\nChoice: 1"
