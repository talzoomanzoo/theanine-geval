I shouldn't have lost my temper like that.\nNeighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset?\nNeighbors A: It was just something that happened at work. My boss was being unreasonable and I couldn't take it anymore.\nNeighbors B: That's understandable.

Did you get the wrong answer? ### Neighbors A: Yeah, I thought I had it all figured out, but when I went back to check, I realized I had added wrong. ### Neighbors B: That's frustrating, but it happens to everyone. Don't beat yourself up about it. ### Neighbors A: I know, but I just hate making mistakes like that. Remember when I cleaned the tree house and wanted to make sure it was perfect? ### Neighbors B: Yeah, I remember. You did a great job with that. ### Neighbors A: It's just like that.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more helpful in this context as it contains information related to a previous situation where Neighbors A expressed frustration over making mistakes and striving for perfection. This parallels the current situation of dealing with difficulties at work and can provide relevant context for how Neighbors A handles stressful situations. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, discusses shared community tasks, which doesn't directly relate to Neighbors A's current frustration with their boss.\n\nChoice: 2"
