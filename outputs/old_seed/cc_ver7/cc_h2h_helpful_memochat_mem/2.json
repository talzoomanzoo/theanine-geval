    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides specific details about similar past interactions between the neighbors, such as working on chores together and enjoying each other's company outside, which aligns closely with the dialogue context where Neighbors A and B are reminiscing about mowing the lawn. It not only reinforces their friendship but also highlights their shared experiences, making it more directly relevant and useful for Neighbors A to continue the conversation or address Neighbors B's concerns. MEMORY 1 is more generic and lacks specific events that connect to the current conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
