I thought we were happy together.\nNeighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbor A recently moved to a new neighborhood and feels safer and happier there. This change led to Neighbor A appreciating the emotional support and understanding from Neighbor B during their time of grief. Neighbor A was tired of living in a run-down apartment complex, which caused them and Neighbor B to become neighbors who catch up outside of their neighborhood. Furthermore, Neighbor B's mention of the affluent neighborhood made Neighbor A want to go for walks, leading to both neighbors enjoying walks together, especially to the park. Their shared love for the park has strengthened their close friendship, with shared memories of spending time together there.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Support during tough times', 'Related Summaries': 'Neighbors A opens up about their grandmother's passing and Neighbors B offers support.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Neighbors A: It's been a tough couple of days. My grandmother passed away and I can't stop thinking about her.  ### Neighbors B: I'm so sorry for your loss. Is there anything I can do to help you through this difficult time?  ### Neighbors A: Just being here for me means a lot. I remember how much my grandmother loved taking walks in the park. We used to go there all the time when I was a kid.  ### Neighbors B: Let's go for a walk in the park in her memory. We can reminisce about the good times you had with your grandmother.  ### Neighbors A: That's a great idea. I think being in nature will help clear my mind and ease my pain.  ### Neighbors B: Remember the time we went to the park a few years ago? We played video games together first, and then enjoyed a nice stroll around the park.  ### Neighbors A: Yes, that was a fun day. I'm really thankful for our friendship, it helps keep me strong during these tough times.  ### Neighbors B: I'm here for you, buddy. It's okay to cry and let your emotions out.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 discusses the physical environment and shared activities of Neighbors A and B, but does not directly relate to the emotional support context needed for the dialogue about a breakup.
