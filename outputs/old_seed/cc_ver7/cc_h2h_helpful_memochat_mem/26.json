It also includes instances of mutual admiration and apologies, which align with the husband's recent apologies for past mistakes and appreciation for his wife's bravery. Memory 1 is more general and focused on the husband's motivation and promise-keeping, which, while related, is less directly connected to the last topic of the dance.\n\nChoice: 2"
