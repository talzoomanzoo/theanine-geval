    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides useful and relevant information for Co-worker B to continue the conversation with Co-worker A about self-doubt and gaining confidence, as Co-worker A has admitted to feeling uncertain despite recent success. The memory reinforces a theme of encouragement and personal growth which is consistent with the current dialogue. MEMORY 2, while related to past mistakes and containing relevant encouragement, leans more towards a specific negative past incident and less on the current context of support in the workplace setting. It also lacks the element of reassurance that Co-worker B could provide based on Co-worker Aâ€™s admission of uncertainty regarding their love for singing.\n\nChoice: 1"
