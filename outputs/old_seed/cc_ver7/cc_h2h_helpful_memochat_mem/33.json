It's a two-way street, and it's important to be there for each other.\nNeighbors A: I remember when I helped you move last year, and then you watched my cat when I went on vacation.\nNeighbors B: Yes, and I appreciate it so much. It's always nice to have someone you can count on.\nNeighbors A: That's true. And speaking of which, I'm helping another friend move next weekend. It'll be a big job, but I know they'd do the same for me. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbors A thanked Neighbors B for the suggestion about the necklace and stumbled upon Neighbors B's shop. Neighbors B then offered to help Neighbors A with the apology process. \nNeighbors A bought a necklace from Neighbors B's shop and loves it.

Is the rug not laying flat? ### Neighbors A: No, it's not. It keeps curling up at the corners. ### Neighbors B: Have you tried using rug grippers? ### Neighbors A: Yeah, I've tried that before but they didn't seem to work. ### Neighbors B: Maybe you could try getting a rug pad? That may help to keep it in place. ### Neighbors A: That's a good idea. I'll have to look into that.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains irrelevant information about a shop and a necklace, which does not pertain to the topic of neighbors helping each other. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 discusses a situation where Neighbors B provides a helpful suggestion regarding a rug issue. While it isn't directly related to moving or cat watching, it still aligns with the theme of neighbors helping neighbors with everyday problems. Therefore, MEMORY 2 is more useful in this context.\n\nChoice: 2"
