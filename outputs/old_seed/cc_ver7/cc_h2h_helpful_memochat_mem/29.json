    "prediction": "Explanation: The Dialogue Context involves a light-hearted and somewhat embarrassing situation where Classmates B accidentally spilled lunch on themselves. The best Memory should relate to embarrassment, faux pas, or supportive interactions between the two classmates as they navigate small challenges. MEMORY 1 does not touch on embarrassment or supportive dynamics relevant to minor personal mishaps like a spilled lunch. Instead, it presents a situation involving space travel, which is irrelevant to the context. MEMORY 2 contains relevant information about how Classmates B supported Classmates A during a challenging time, emphasizing the supportive and non-judgmental nature of their friendship, which is more helpful in addressing the current situation of embarrassment in the dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 2"
