    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant about the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, enabling the Mentor to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Thank you for finding my glasses for me, Mentor. I always seem to misplace them.\nMentor: Not a problem, Mentee. I'm glad I could help. \nMentee: This actually reminds me of when I was struggling with substance abuse. I would often lose things or forget where I put things because of my drinking. It's amazing how much clearer my mind is now that I'm sober. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Mentee used to feel overwhelmed, but now feels more fulfilled by living in the moment. Mentee credits Mentor for their help in achieving sobriety and expresses gratitude for the support. Mentee admires Mentor's success and wants to learn from them.\n\n2. Mentor is supportive of the Mentee's approach and encourages them to continue. Mentee found getting sober to be a challenging process but is now proud of their progress. The Mentee is dedicated to their sobriety and believes incorporating yoga into their routine will benefit their mental and physical health.\n\n3. Both the Mentor and Mentee believe that living in the moment can bring joy and strength in facing challenges. Mentor has been supportive of Mentee's journey to sobriety. Mentee has a history of substance abuse but has been sober for a year.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Mentee has a history of substance abuse but has been sober for a year.\n2. Mentor is proud of Mentee for making positive changes and taking control of their life.\n3. Mentee values living in the moment and staying focused on their sobriety and goals.\n4. Mentor acknowledges Mentee's achievements and provides ongoing support and guidance.\n5. The Mentor advises the Mentee to be gentle with themselves when they slip back into old patterns.\n6. The Mentee is dedicated to their sobriety and believes incorporating yoga into their routine will benefit their mental and physical health.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides a broader context relating to the Mentee's gratitude towards the Mentor for their support, how they've admired the Mentor's success, the challenges faced during sobriety, and their commitment to maintaining it through practices like yoga. These points are more aligned with the latest utterance in the dialogue context, where the Mentee reflects on their clearer mindset since achieving sobriety. This context not only shows the Mentee's journey but also emphasizes the Mentor's role, making it more helpful for the Mentor to acknowledge and encourage these reflections in the conversation. MEMORY 2, while containing relevant information, lacks the depth of personal connection and emotional gratitude found in MEMORY 1.\n\nChoice: 1"
