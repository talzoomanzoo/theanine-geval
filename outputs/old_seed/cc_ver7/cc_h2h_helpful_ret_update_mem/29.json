I won't judge you, I promise.\nClassmates B: Well, I accidentally spilled my lunch all over myself in front of some people.\nClassmates A: (laughs) That's it? That's why you're embarrassed? I thought it was something serious. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context revolves around a lighthearted and slightly embarrassing situation involving Classmates B spilling their lunch, and Classmates A reacting to it. For Classmates B to respond appropriately, the memory should ideally highlight elements of their relationship with Classmates A that show support, understanding, or mutual teasing. Memory 2 has elements that touch on praise and support from Classmates B to Classmates A, which could be relevant in understanding the dynamics of support and teasing in their friendship, but Memory 1, with its focus on resilience and support, is more contextual for the response, though not directly relevant. \n\nChoice: 1"
