    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is a simple greeting about well-being (\"Hey, how are you feeling today?\"). This context doesn't require the information about their music collaboration or childhood memories. Thus, the most relevant memory would be related to the supportive friendship they share, as it may inform how Classmates A responds in a caring or personal manner. MEMORY 2 provides this information with point 1, which is directly relevant and sufficient for understanding their relationship dynamic, without extra irrelevant details.\n\nChoice: 2"
