    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around Co-worker A being promoted to a product manager position, and feeling both excited and nervous about the increased responsibility. Co-worker B congratulates them and expresses confidence in their leadership abilities. To respond appropriately, Co-worker B should recall past encouragements and acknowledgments of Co-worker Aâ€™s leadership aspirations and growth. \n\nMEMORY 2 succinctly highlights Co-worker A's ongoing journey toward leadership and Co-worker B's acknowledgment and support. It notes the past encouragement to take on more responsibility, the acknowledgment of growth, and Co-worker A's focus on communication and leadership aspirations. This is directly relevant and supportive of the current context in which Co-worker A has been promoted and is looking forward to leading a team.\n\nMEMORY 1, while somewhat similar, contains repetitive and less relevant details about fantasies and embarrassment, and is more wordy without adding helpful context for the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nChoice: 2"
