I thought we were happy together.\nNeighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbor A recently moved to a new neighborhood and feels safer and happier there. This change led to Neighbor A appreciating the emotional support and understanding from Neighbor B during their time of grief. Neighbor A was tired of living in a run-down apartment complex, which caused them and Neighbor B to become neighbors who catch up outside of their neighborhood.

Their shared love for the park has strengthened their close friendship, with shared memories of spending time together there.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbor A is grieving the recent loss of their grandmother.\n2. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have a close friendship and have shared memories of spending time together in the park.\n3. Neighbor B is offering support and companionship to Neighbor A during their difficult time.\n4. Neighbor A and Neighbor B are neighbors who catch up outside of their neighborhood.\n5.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The current conversation is about Neighbor A experiencing a breakup and Neighbor B offering support. MEMORY 2 contains specific information about Neighbor A grieving the recent loss of their grandmother, emphasizing the ongoing support from Neighbor B during difficult times. This context is directly relevant as it highlights the supportive role of Neighbor B, providing an insightful background for understanding the dynamics of their friendship. In contrast, MEMORY 1 focuses more on the neighbors' shared love for their new environment, which is less relevant to the emotional support context in the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 2"
