I feel like we have something special going on here. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Classmate A confesses their love to Classmate B, who does not feel the same way.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context discusses Classmate A's appreciation and sense of honor to be part of the class, indicating a positive and communal sentiment. MEMORY 1 provides specific details about a non-mutual romantic confession and Classmate B's relief in the context of maintaining friendship, which potentially offers relevant background on their relationship status. MEMORY 2 provides a broader picture with compliments, past conversations, and a confession, but gives more context about their friendship dynamics and includes more related events like the wedding. However, MEMORY 2 also includes a duplicate and less relevant information that could distract from an appropriate response.\n\nChoice: 1"
