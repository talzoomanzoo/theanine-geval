    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant about the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, enabling the Neighbors A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm sorry you had to hear me swear like that. I shouldn't have lost my temper like that.\nNeighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset?\nNeighbors A: It was just something that happened at work. My boss was being unreasonable and I couldn't take it anymore.\nNeighbors B: That's understandable. Have you tried talking to your boss about it?\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I have, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I just feel like I'm stuck in a dead-end job.\nNeighbors B: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you considered looking for a new job? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbor B shared a childhood memory of their tree house being destroyed due to lack of proper care. This led to Neighbor A helping with their lawn, showcasing mutual support between them. This mutual support is a key characteristic of their relationship as neighbors.\nNeighbor A stressed the significance of maintaining clean outdoor spaces for the future, which Neighbor B agreed with and highlighted the sense of community that arises from assisting each other. This emphasis on mutual help is a core aspect of the bond between Neighbors A and B.\nNeighbor A discussed the importance of cleaning a tree house to prevent insects and spiders from inhabiting it, emphasizing the collaborative nature of their neighborhood where Neighbors A and B assist each other with various tasks. This spirit of reciprocity is valued by Neighbor B, who appreciates the mutual support between them as neighbors.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbors B is supportive and understanding of Neighbors A's mistake.\n2. Neighbors A wants to rearrange their living room and Neighbors B has experience with rearranging furniture.\n3. Neighbors A and B have a positive and helpful relationship as neighbors.\n4. Neighbors A values appreciation and expresses gratitude for help received.\n5. Neighbors A is detail-oriented and strives for perfection.\n6. Neighbors B values reciprocity and acknowledges the mutual help between them as neighbors.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about Neighbors A expressing frustration over their work situation and considering looking for a new job. MEMORY 2 is more helpful because it directly highlights Neighbors B's supportive and understanding nature, which aligns with the current conversation where Neighbors B is providing emotional support and advice to Neighbors A. This specific detail about Neighbors B's supportive nature can help enable Neighbors A to continue expressing their concerns and be more open to receiving advice or support. \n\nMemory 1 mainly discusses past experiences related to mutual support in a different context (outdoor maintenance and care), which is less relevant to the current work-related discussion.\n\nChoice: 2"
