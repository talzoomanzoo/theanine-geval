    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides more relevant details about the relationship dynamics between Classmates A and B, such as the fact that Classmates B feels relieved to have someone to confide in and previous positive interactions like the coffee shop moment. These details are pertinent as they can help Classmates B respond to the possibility of a relationship beyond friendship with Classmates A. MEMORY 1 focuses more broadly on their supportive friendship but lacks the specific context of intimate or personal interactions that MEMORY 2 offers.\n\nChoice: 2"
