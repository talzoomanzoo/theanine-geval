I've been searching everywhere for new ideas, but nothing seems to work.\nWife: Have you tried brainstorming with me? Sometimes bouncing ideas off of someone else can help.\nHusband: I have, but I don't want to bother you too much with my writing stuff.\nWife: Nonsense! You can always come to me with anything. Plus, I enjoy helping you with your creative process. Have you also tried revisiting some of the writing prompts we did in our creative writing class?\nHusband: I have, but I feel like I'm just repeating the same stories over and over again.\nWife: Maybe it's time to take a step back and try something new. Have you ever tried writing in a different genre or experimenting with different styles? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. The wife sharing her passion for movies with the husband led to her suggesting using more modern language for better understanding.\n2. Both the husband and wife expressing a desire for happiness and understanding resulted in the husband agreeing to adapt to modern language for improved communication.\n3. The husband's willingness to try again about movies changed into him being honest about his feelings for Sarah, leading to an agreement to use modern language for better communication.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Wife suggests that husband should try using more modern language to be better understood.\n2. Wife brings up Sarah, the husband's previous partner, but husband says he hasn't thought about her much.\n3. The wife compares the situation to when the husband fell asleep during a movie she recommended, indicating past issues in their relationship.\n4. Husband agrees to try adapting to modern language for better communication with his wife.\n5. The wife reassures the husband that it's okay to be different and encourages him to embrace who he is.\n6. The husband and wife plan to have a movie night together in the future.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more relevant and helpful to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT because it includes examples of the wife's support in helping the husband to understand things better, which is similar to the current conversation about brainstorming and writing ideas. MEMORY 1 does not provide as specific or relevant information to respond to the wife's encouragement of creativity.\n\nChoice: 2"
