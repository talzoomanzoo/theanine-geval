It includes the husband's inspiration from his wife, his promise to involve her, their commitment to each other, and specific instances such as the wife's bravery and their shared enjoyment of dancing. These points are relevant to the ongoing conversation about mutual appreciation, past experiences, and shared interests like dancing, which help the wife respond more appropriately and within the context of the dialogue.
