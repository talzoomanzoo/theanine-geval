    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant about the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, enabling the Co-workers A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Co-worker B commended Co-worker A for their bravery and willingness to help, showing support and willingness to assist in any situation. This led to Co-worker A feeling grateful and appreciative of Co-worker B's help.\n2. Co-worker A witnessed a fight and intervened to separate the two women, displaying bravery and strength. This act of courage is remembered by others, including Co-worker B, who admires Co-worker A's resilience and positivity. Co-worker B also appreciates Co-worker A's positive energy and friendship.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\n2. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's positivity and friendship.\n3. Co-worker B is supportive and willing to help in any way.\n4. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\n5. Co-worker A is alive but will need time to adjust to their new way of life.\n6. Co-worker A intervened to help two women who were fighting, showing bravery and a desire to make a positive impact.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context involves Co-worker A expressing harmful intentions masked as love, and Co-worker B reacting with a reasoned perspective on love and ethics. MEMORY 1 includes instances of Co-worker A showing bravery and having a positive relationship with Co-worker B, but it lacks direct relevance to the ethical issue being discussed. MEMORY 2, while more fragmented, does contain points about Co-worker B's supportive and appreciative behavior towards Co-worker A, which might help Co-worker B to frame their argument in a supportive manner while addressing Co-worker A's inappropriate plan.\n\nChoice: 2"
