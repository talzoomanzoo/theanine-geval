    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant about the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, enabling the Husband to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I'm feeling stuck with my writing. I've been searching everywhere for new ideas, but nothing seems to work.\nWife: Have you tried brainstorming with me? Sometimes bouncing ideas off of someone else can help.\nHusband: I have, but I don't want to bother you too much with my writing stuff.\nWife: Nonsense! You can always come to me with anything. Plus, I enjoy helping you with your creative process. Have you also tried revisiting some of the writing prompts we did in our creative writing class?\nHusband: I have, but I feel like I'm just repeating the same stories over and over again.\nWife: Maybe it's time to take a step back and try something new. Have you ever tried writing in a different genre or experimenting with different styles? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. The wife sharing her passion for movies with the husband led to her suggesting using more modern language for better understanding.\n2. Both the husband and wife expressing a desire for happiness and understanding resulted in the husband agreeing to adapt to modern language for improved communication.\n3. The husband's willingness to try again about movies changed into him being honest about his feelings for Sarah, leading to an agreement to use modern language for better communication.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Wife suggests that husband should try using more modern language to be better understood.\n2. The husband is open to learning more about movies, showing a willingness to try again.\n3. Husband agrees to try adapting to modern language for better communication with his wife.\n4. The wife compares the situation to when the husband fell asleep during a movie she recommended, indicating past issues in their relationship.\n5. Wife brings up Sarah, the husband's previous partner, but husband says he hasn't thought about her much.\n6. The wife reassures the husband that it's okay to be different and encourages him to embrace who he is.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The current DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about the husband feeling stuck in his writing and discussing ways to inspire new ideas. MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 both touch on the idea of communication between the husband and wife, with MEMORY 2 including a specific suggestion from the wife about using modern language, which could relate to writing style adjustments. However, MEMORY 2 also includes the wife reassuring the husband to embrace who he is, which aligns with the wife's supportive tone in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This aspect of MEMORY 2 connects more directly with the wife's encouragement to experiment with different styles or genres in his writing. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, is less directly relevant to the subject of writing or trying new things.\n\nChoice: 2"
