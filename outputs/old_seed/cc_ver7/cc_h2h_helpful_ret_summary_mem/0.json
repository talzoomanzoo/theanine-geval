I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends.\nMentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\nMentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. The Mentor has been guiding and supporting the Mentee in their work for years, which causes the Mentee to be offered a job and decide to take the job in the city.\n2. The Mentee hopes to inspire others to join the cause of gender equality and fighting discrimination, so the Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process, even though the Mentee is feeling overwhelmed with the college application process.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace.\n2. Mentee is feeling overwhelmed with the college application process.\n3. The Mentee has been offered a job and has decided to take the job in the city.\n4. The Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process.\n5. The Mentor is supportive and praises the Mentee for their mature decision-making process.\n6. Mentor emphasizes the importance of self-care for dealing with challenges.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 contains more relevant and helpful information for the current Dialogue Context. It provides information about the Mentee's recent move to the city and the challenges they are facing, including the acknowledgement of feeling overwhelmed, the decision to take a job in the city, and the importance of self-care emphasized by the Mentor. These details align closely with the Mentee's current feeling of loneliness and needing support in a new environment. On the other hand, MEMORY 1 offers broad background information that doesn't directly address the Mentee's current situation of feeling lonely and integrating into a new social setting.\n\nChoice: 2"
