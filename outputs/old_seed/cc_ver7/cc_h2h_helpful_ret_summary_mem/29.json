    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant about the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, enabling the Classmates B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Why is your face so red and splotchy, Classmates B? Did you get sunburned?\nClassmates B: No, I didn't get sunburned. I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed.\nClassmates A: Embarrassed? Why?\nClassmates B: It's nothing, really. Just something embarrassing happened to me earlier.\nClassmates A: Come on, tell me! I won't judge you, I promise.\nClassmates B: Well, I accidentally spilled my lunch all over myself in front of some people.\nClassmates A: (laughs) That's it? That's why you're embarrassed? I thought it was something serious. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. After successfully landing on the moon but running out of oxygen, Classmate A showed determination in fixing their spaceship after it was damaged in a meteor shower. This led to Classmates B praising Classmate A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.\n   \n2. Classmates A expresses gratitude for Classmates B's support during the difficult situation, leading Classmate A to feel that pushing themselves to do better helps them improve their skills and learn something new. Both classmates value supporting and uplifting each other in their learning and growth, with Classmates A helping Classmates B out of friendship and believing in supporting each other.\n\n3. Classmates A expresses gratitude for Classmates B's support during the difficult situation, which prompts Classmate B to acknowledge Classmate A's success in their career due to their determination and refusal to settle for mediocrity.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Classmates A expresses gratitude for Classmates B's support during the difficult situation.\n2. Classmates B praised Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.\n3. Classmates A helped Classmates B out of friendship and believes in supporting each other.\n4. Classmate B admires Classmate A's attitude and sees it as a good example for others.\n5. Classmates A is stranded in space, running out of oxygen and feeling lightheaded.\n6. Classmates A mentioned that life is full of surprises and anything is possible.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around an incident where Classmates B feels embarrassed due to an incident at lunch. The conversation is light-hearted and involves embarrassment rather than any serious difficult situations. MEMORY 1 is focused on accomplishments, gratitude, and serious situations like being in space, which is not relevant or helpful for this conversation. MEMORY 2 also revolves around difficult situations like being stranded in space but includes some information about Classmates B praising Classmates A and supportive dynamics, which could align with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT's tone of friendship and support. However, neither memory provides directly relevant information, but MEMORY 2 at least touches upon qualities like resilience that are slightly more related to embarrassment.\n\nChoice: 2"
