Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit.\nNeighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water.\nNeighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it.\nNeighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again.\nNeighbors A: I won't. So, do you remember the time when I mowed the lawn with that old push mower?\nNeighbors B: Yeah, I remember that. That was pretty tough work.\nNeighbors A: It was. But it was also a good workout.\nNeighbors B: I prefer to work out indoors where there's air conditioning.\nNeighbors A: Ha, I remember when I took off my jacket and put my feet up in your armchair. It was so warm that day.\nNeighbors B: Yeah, that was a hot day. I'm glad you felt comfortable in my home though.\nNeighbors A: You know, I really enjoy spending time with you. I want to get to know you even better.\nNeighbors B: I feel the same way. We should plan something fun to do together.\nNeighbors A: Absolutely. Hey, do you remember when I ripped off the tag from my shirt?\nNeighbors B: Yeah, your mom was pretty upset about that.\nNeighbors A: I didn't think it was a big deal, but she sure did. Do you ever have disagreements like that with your parents? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbors A and B have agreed to hang out once a week, possibly watching a movie, getting coffee, or just talking.

They reminisce about past events during their time together.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n2. Both Neighbors A and B enjoy spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn.\n3. Neighbors A and B are on friendly terms and enjoy spending time together.\n4. Neighbors A and B have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside.\n5. Neighbors A and B plan to work on mowing the lawn together next time to make it easier and possibly discover more things in common.\n6. Neighbors A and B have not seen each other in a while and are catching up.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nMEMORY 1 provides helpful context regarding Neighbors A and B's decision to hang out once a week, indicating their enjoyment of spending time together and their reminiscing about past events. This aligns well with Neighbors B contemplating past disagreements with their parents, as it involves reminiscing about relationships. \n\nWhile MEMORY 2 provides some background details, such as their shared enjoyment of outdoor activities, which aligns with the dialogue context about mowing the lawn, it does not offer the relevant aspect of regular hangouts that MEMORY 1 does.\n\nChoice: 1"
