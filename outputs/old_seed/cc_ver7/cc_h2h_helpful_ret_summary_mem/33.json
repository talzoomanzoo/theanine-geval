    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant about the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, enabling the Neighbors B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: It's great to have friends who can help each other out, isn't it?\nNeighbors B: Absolutely. It's a two-way street, and it's important to be there for each other.\nNeighbors A: I remember when I helped you move last year, and then you watched my cat when I went on vacation.\nNeighbors B: Yes, and I appreciate it so much. It's always nice to have someone you can count on.\nNeighbors A: That's true. And speaking of which, I'm helping another friend move next weekend. It'll be a big job, but I know they'd do the same for me. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbors A thanked Neighbors B for the suggestion about the necklace and stumbled upon Neighbors B's shop. Neighbors B then offered to help Neighbors A with the apology process. \nNeighbors A bought a necklace from Neighbors B's shop and loves it. Neighbors B has a great selection of earrings and is willing to help find the perfect match for the dress.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbors A thanked Neighbors B for the suggestion.\n2. Neighbors B offered to help Neighbors A with the apology process.\n3. Neighbors A bought a necklace from Neighbors B's shop and loves it.\n4. Both neighbors express the difficulty of not being able to adopt all the animals they see but appreciate those who do adopt and give them loving homes.\n5. Neighbors B emphasized the importance of apologizing to show care for the relationship.\n6. Neighbors A was looking for a new necklace and stumbled upon Neighbors B's shop.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The MEMORY information does not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is about mutual support and helping each other out. However, MEMORY 2 contains a broader set of interactions that emphasize helping each other and shows a history of supportive actions (e.g., assisting with an apology, offering necklace suggestions) despite not being directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. MEMORY 2 also emphasizes the importance of relationships, which resonates with Neighbors B's response about being there for each other.\n\nChoice: 2"
