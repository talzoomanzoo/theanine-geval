Memory 2 is more helpful because it directly mentions Classmate A's dedication to studying hard and taking extra classes, which aligns with Classmate A's expressed enthusiasm for learning about the pyramids. Memory 2 also points to Classmate A's academic improvement and how they have learned to channel frustration into studies, which complements their enthusiasm for further exploration of the topic.
