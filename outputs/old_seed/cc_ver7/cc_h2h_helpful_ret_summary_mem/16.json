I shouldn't have lost my temper like that.\nNeighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset?\nNeighbors A: It was just something that happened at work. My boss was being unreasonable and I couldn't take it anymore.\nNeighbors B: That's understandable. Have you tried talking to your boss about it? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbors A and B share a sense of community by helping each other with tasks like cleaning up a tree house and maintaining outside spaces. This mutual support and reciprocity strengthen their bond as neighbors.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbors B is supportive and understanding of Neighbors A's mistake.\n2. Neighbors A and B are helpful towards each other.\n3. Neighbors B recalls when Neighbors A helped with their lawn, showing mutual support between them.\n4. Neighbors A values appreciation and expresses gratitude for help received.\n5. Neighbors A wants to rearrange their living room and Neighbors B has experience with rearranging furniture.\n6. Neighbors A and B have a positive and helpful relationship as neighbors.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 2 directly mentions Neighbors B being supportive and understanding of Neighbors A's mistakes, which aligns with the current dialogue where B is understanding of A's frustration over a work issue. This memory contributes a broader understanding of their relationship, helping to maintain a sympathetic and supportive tone. Memory 1 talks about shared community efforts, which is useful but less directly applicable to the current conversation topic.\n\nChoice: 2"
