But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\nMentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here.\nMentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people.\nMentee: Those are good suggestions, Mentor. I'll consider joining a club or volunteering. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. The Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains specific information about the Mentee's experience feeling overwhelmed with decision-making and showing gratitude for guidance. This can be relevant to the Mentee's current feeling of loneliness and considering options like joining clubs or volunteering as new decisions to make. Additionally, MEMORY 1 ties the Mentee's actions to being driven by circumstances, which aligns with the context of adjusting to a new city. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, provides more generalized and less directly relatable background information, such as job offers and college applications that are not directly connected to the current dialogue about loneliness and making new friends.\n\nChoice: 1"
