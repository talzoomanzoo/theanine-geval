    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant about the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, enabling the Neighbors A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm sorry you had to hear me swear like that. I shouldn't have lost my temper like that.\nNeighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset?\nNeighbors A: It was just something that happened at work. My boss was being unreasonable and I couldn't take it anymore.\nNeighbors B: That's understandable. Have you tried talking to your boss about it?\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I have, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I just feel like I'm stuck in a dead-end job.\nNeighbors B: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you considered looking for a new job? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbor B shared a childhood memory of their tree house being destroyed due to lack of proper care. This led to Neighbor A helping with their lawn, showcasing mutual support between them. This mutual support is a key characteristic of their relationship as neighbors.\nNeighbor A stressed the significance of maintaining clean outdoor spaces for the future, which Neighbor B agreed with and highlighted the sense of community that arises from assisting each other. This emphasis on mutual help is a core aspect of the bond between Neighbors A and B.\nNeighbor A discussed the importance of cleaning a tree house to prevent insects and spiders from inhabiting it, emphasizing the collaborative nature of their neighborhood where Neighbors A and B assist each other with various tasks. This spirit of reciprocity is valued by Neighbor B, who appreciates the mutual support between them as neighbors.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbors B is supportive and understanding of Neighbors A's mistake.\n2. Neighbors A and B are helpful towards each other.\n3. Neighbors A and B live in the same neighborhood and help each other with tasks.\n4. Neighbors A and B have a positive and helpful relationship as neighbors.\n5. Neighbors B recalls when Neighbors A helped with their lawn, showing mutual support between them.\n6. Neighbors A values appreciation and expresses gratitude for help received.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around Neighbors A expressing frustration about their job situation and Neighbors B showing support and suggesting possible solutions. MEMORY 2 is more helpful as it directly highlights Neighbor B's supportive and understanding nature (points 1 and 4), which is relevant to the context of the conversation. Neighbors A's appreciation for help (point 6) shows openness to support, which aligns with Neighbor B's suggestive approach to help find a solution in the context. MEMORY 1, while giving more specific past events related to mutual support, focuses on the physical maintenance tasks and tree house anecdotes, which are less relevant to the emotional support aspect needed in the current conversation. \n\nChoice: 2"
