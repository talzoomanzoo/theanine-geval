    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context involves Classmates A asking Classmate B about their face being red and splotchy, with Classmate B responding that they are embarrassed. Neither memory directly addresses embarrassment or the specifics of the current conversation. However, Memory 1 has some tangential references to Classmate A's patience, helpfulness, and gratitude which might offer a way to be empathetic or supportive in response to Classmate B's embarrassment. In contrast, Memory 2 introduces unrelated content about space incidents, field trips, and stranded situations which do not relate to feeling embarrassed. Therefore, the slight relevance in Memory 1 about being supportive and gracious might be more useful for Classmate A in continuing the conversation with an empathetic tone.\n\nChoice: 1"
