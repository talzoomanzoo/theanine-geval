Did you get sunburned?\nClassmates B: No, I didn't get sunburned. I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed.\nClassmates A: Embarrassed? Why?\nClassmates B: It's nothing, really. Just something embarrassing happened to me earlier.\nClassmates A: Come on, tell me! I won't judge you, I promise.\nClassmates B: Well, I accidentally spilled my lunch all over myself in front of some people.\nClassmates A: (laughs) That's it? That's why you're embarrassed? I thought it was something serious.\nClassmates B: (sighs) Yeah, it's silly. But still embarrassing.\nClassmates A: Don't worry about it. It happens to everyone. Remember the time I tripped and fell in front of the whole class during our presentation? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Classmates A successfully lands on a moon but is running out of oxygen and needs to repair the ship to get back home. This leads to Classmate A showing determination in fixing their spaceship after it was damaged in a meteor shower, which prompts Classmates B to praise Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.\n\n2. Classmates A and B have been on field trips to other planets or moons before, like Mars, which is a topic they both enjoy. This admiration makes Classmate B see Classmate A's attitude as a good example for others. As a result, both classmates value supporting and uplifting each other in their learning and growth, leading to Classmates A helping Classmates B out of friendship and believing in supporting each other.\n\n3. Classmates A expresses gratitude for Classmates B's support during a difficult situation, which is hindered by Classmates A helping Classmates B out of friendship and believing in supporting each other.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Classmates A expresses gratitude for Classmates B's support during the difficult situation.\n2. Classmates B praised Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.\n3.

Classmates A is stranded in space, running out of oxygen and feeling lightheaded.\n6. Classmates A mentioned that life is full of surprises and anything is possible.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains specific scenarios and interactions relevant to the dialogue context, such as shared experiences and support, which align with the current situation of one classmate comforting another over an embarrassing incident. These memories illustrate a supportive relationship, which is directly applicable to the ongoing dialogue where reassurance is being offered. MEMORY 2 is more general and lists experiences that are less directly related to the specific context of spilling lunch and offering reassurance. Therefore, MEMORY 1 is more helpful in providing relevant background for Classmates B to respond appropriately.\n\nChoice: 1"
