    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant about the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, enabling the Neighbors A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Can you believe it? I'm a millionaire now! \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- Neighbors B is supportive and believes Neighbors A's story, suggesting looking up UFO sightings in the area. This leads to Neighbors A feeling tired from work and needing to catch up on sleep. Neighbors B has been supportive of Neighbors A's job search, offering to connect them with people in different industries, which caused Neighbors A to make a big career change recently and be much happier now.\n\n- Neighbors A plans to do some research and possibly report the sighting of the UFO, then suggests planning something else to do together over the weekend. This makes Neighbors A want to start looking for new opportunities soon, updating their resume and starting networking, after they took the leap to make a change and are glad they did.\n\n- Neighbors B is supportive and believes Neighbors A's story, suggesting looking up UFO sightings in the area, and this is in the same topic where Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's decision and admires the courage it took.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbors A made a big career change recently and is much happier now.\n2. Neighbors A took the leap to make a change and is glad they did.\n3. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's decision and admires the courage it took.\n4. Neighbors A's husband thinks they are crazy for believing they saw a UFO.\n5. Neighbors A is feeling stagnant in their current job and is looking for more growth and challenge.\n6. Neighbors A believes they saw a UFO in their backyard and still thinks it was real, finding it crazy to think about.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Neighbors A claims to be a millionaire. MEMORY 2 provides context about Neighbors A's recent career change and their happiness, which can relate to their newfound millionaire status. It also notes their husband's skepticism about UFOs, which could humorously contrast with the surprise of being a millionaire. MEMORY 1, while detailed, veers more towards Neighbors B's supportive role and UFO discussions unrelated to financial gain, offering less direct relevance to the current topic.\n\nChoice: 2"
