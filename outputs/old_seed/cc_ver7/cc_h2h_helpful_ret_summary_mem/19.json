    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 contains several points that are directly relevant to the dialogue context. In particular, point 1 aligns with both the husband and wife's appreciation for the small gestures, like hanging up lights and creating a cozy environment. This makes it more directly applicable to the husband's actions and the wife's expression of gratitude. Additionally, the sentiment of support and happiness in MEMORY 2 is more consistently focused on their mutual appreciation of these small efforts, which directly feeds into the cozy atmosphere the husband created. MEMORY 1 contains more unnecessary details about projects and friendships that do not directly relate to the husband's action of decorating their home.\n\nChoice: 2"
