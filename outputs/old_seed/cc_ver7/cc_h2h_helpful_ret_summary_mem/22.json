I feel like we have something special going on here. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Classmate A confesses their love to Classmate B, who does not feel the same way. This leads to Classmate B appreciating Classmate A's honesty but not returning the romantic feelings.\n2. Classmate B plans to check their schedule to go to the mall with Classmate A.

Classmates A values their friendship with Classmates B and looks forward to wearing a black suit to a wedding reception.\n6. Classmates A is excited for a wedding reception and plans to dance with the bride.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context revolves around Classmate A expressing a sense of honor and special connection with the class. It does not mention romantic feelings or a specific event like a wedding reception, so the memory should focus on the general feelings of camaraderie and appreciation within the group. MEMORY 2 contains a variety of contexts, such as an appreciation of suits and a friendship dynamic, which are more closely related to the expression of feeling honored and having something special. In contrast, MEMORY 1 mainly focuses on a romantic context and the aftermath, which is not directly relevant to the current dialogue context about class unity and honor.\n\nChoice: 2"
