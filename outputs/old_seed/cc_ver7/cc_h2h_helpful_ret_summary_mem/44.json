    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around Classmates B expressing a desire for independence, with Classmates A suggesting ways Classmates B could start small. In this context, MEMORY 2 provides more relevant and helpful information, as it includes a detail (point 4) about Classmates B's interest in learning to play an instrument, which can be proposed as a small step toward independence. This specific interest can guide Classmates A's response by suggesting that Classmates B could start learning an instrument by themselves. MEMORY 1 lacks this specific detail and instead focuses more on their mutual enjoyment of music and collaborative plans, which is less directly useful for addressing the concern of becoming more independent.\n\nChoice: 2"
