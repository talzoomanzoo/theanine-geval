    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is about Neighbors A claiming they are a millionaire. The helpful memory should reflect the circumstances surrounding this sudden revelation. MEMORY 2 describes the general characteristics and relationship dynamics between Neighbors A and B, but it lacks direct relevance to the \"millionaire\" scenario. MEMORY 1, while primarily about UFO sightings and career changes, includes recent supportive interactions that showcase reliance on Neighbors B. Neither memory directly addresses the sudden shift in financial status or relates to the \"millionaire\" announcement directly. However, MEMORY 1's specific mention of recent career changes could indirectly relate to financial success, making it mildly more pertinent. \n\nChoice: 1"
