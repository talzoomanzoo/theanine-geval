Did you get sunburned?\nClassmates B: No, I didn't get sunburned. I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed.\nClassmates A: Embarrassed? Why?\nClassmates B: It's nothing, really. Just something embarrassing happened to me earlier.\nClassmates A: Come on, tell me! I won't judge you, I promise.\nClassmates B: Well, I accidentally spilled my lunch all over myself in front of some people.\nClassmates A: (laughs) That's it? That's why you're embarrassed? I thought it was something serious.\nClassmates B: (sighs) Yeah, it's silly. But still embarrassing.\nClassmates A: Don't worry about it. It happens to everyone. Remember the time I tripped and fell in front of the whole class during our presentation? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Classmates A successfully lands on a moon but is running out of oxygen and needs to repair the ship to get back home. This leads to Classmate A showing determination in fixing their spaceship after it was damaged in a meteor shower, which prompts Classmates B to praise Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.\n\n2. Classmates A and B have been on field trips to other planets or moons before, like Mars, which is a topic they both enjoy. This admiration makes Classmate B see Classmate A's attitude as a good example for others. As a result, both classmates value supporting and uplifting each other in their learning and growth, leading to Classmates A helping Classmates B out of friendship and believing in supporting each other.\n\n3. Classmates A expresses gratitude for Classmates B's support during a difficult situation, which is hindered by Classmates A helping Classmates B out of friendship and believing in supporting each other.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description: Classmates A is a determined individual who believes in doing their best at everything.

Life is indeed full of surprises for Classmates A and B.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves Classmates B feeling embarrassed about spilling lunch, with Classmates A attempting to reassure them. MEMORY 2 is more helpful as it describes the supportive and appreciative relationship that Classmates B shares with Classmates A. It directly relates to Classmates A's role in providing reassurance by citing examples of mutual support and appreciation. MEMORY 1 focuses more on unrelated space adventures, which does not add to the current context of embarrassment and reassurance.\n\nChoice: 2"
