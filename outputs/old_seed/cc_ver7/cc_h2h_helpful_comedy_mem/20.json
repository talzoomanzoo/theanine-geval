    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 focuses more specifically on the idea of appreciating the little things in life, directly connecting with the husband's sentiment in the dialogue about how \"it's the little things that count.\" This is relevant to the dialogue context as it aligns with the conversation about the small acts, like hanging lights, that contribute to a cozy and warm atmosphere. MEMORY 2 contains a lot of extraneous information that, while relevant to their broader life context, doesn't directly contribute to responding to the specific dialogue about doing small acts for each other and appreciating them.\n\nChoice: 1"
