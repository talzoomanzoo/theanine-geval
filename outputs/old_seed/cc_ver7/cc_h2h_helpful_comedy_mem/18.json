I sang a solo at church this past weekend! \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Co-worker A, described as having \"Sherlock Holmes-like skills\" and enjoying solving mysteries, did some research on social media to find out that Co-worker B is married. Co-worker B was surprised when Co-worker A found out they were married.\n2. Co-worker A suggests celebrating their detective work with drinks after work, as they are excited about payday and being able to pay off bills.

Co-workers A even researched Co-workers B's marital status and suggested applying to be a detective.\n\nEvent Description: Co-workers A found out about an employee hiding clothes to sell on the side and used their Sherlock Holmes-like skills to uncover the mystery.

Co-workers A and Co-workers B used to work at the clothing store, where they always got paid every Friday and were able to pay their bills on time. They both made $300 in one week and have memories of Ms. Singh leaving.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves Co-worker A sharing about singing a solo at church, which is more associated with personal achievements or events rather than their detective skills or previous work experiences. MEMORY 2 provides extensive information about Co-worker A's investigative skills and work history but fails to mention anything related to singing or involvement in church activities. MEMORY 1, while also focused on detective skills and work history, includes broader context about Co-worker A's excitement and celebratory nature, which can be relevant to the pride they may feel about their performance, even though it doesn't directly mention singing. However, neither memory is directly relevant or helpful regarding Co-worker A's church singing experience. Therefore, the memories don't differ much in terms of the specific relevancy needed here.\n\nChoice: tie"
