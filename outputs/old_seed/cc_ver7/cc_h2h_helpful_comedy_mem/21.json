    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT centers on Co-worker A expressing a sense of fulfillment from leadership and helping others, and Co-worker B acknowledging Co-worker A's ability to make others feel better. In this context, MEMORY 2 provides information about Co-worker B's inclination towards resolving interpersonal issues and offering encouragement, aligning well with the positive and supportive interaction in the dialogue. This is more relevant to the context than MEMORY 1, which primarily discusses financial motivations and does not directly relate to the current dialogue about leadership and emotional support. \n\nChoice: 2"
