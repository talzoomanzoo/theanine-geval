While both memories describe the supportive relationship between the neighbors, MEMORY 2 provides more specific examples of Neighbors B's proactive and reassuring nature. This information is directly relevant to the dialogue context, as Neighbors B is offering understanding and might suggest practical solutions or emotional support to Neighbors A for dealing with work stress. MEMORY 1, while highlighting the mutual support, lacks the same level of detailed examples relevant to providing emotional support or advice in the given situation.\n\nChoice: 2"
