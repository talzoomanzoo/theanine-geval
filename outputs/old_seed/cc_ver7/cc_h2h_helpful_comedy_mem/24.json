    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides more relevant and comprehensive context about the relationship and shared experiences between Classmates A and B. It mentions Classmates A's appreciation for responsible behavior and gratitude for support, as well as their excitement for new experiences, which aligns with the context of sharing an act of kindness. This memory also acknowledges Classmates A's new car, which could relate to the last utterance about helping a neighbor, hinting at a possible connection to recent experiences. MEMORY 1 lacks direct relevance to the act of helping a neighbor and does not provide new informative links to the dialogue's context as effectively as MEMORY 2.\n\nChoice: 2"
