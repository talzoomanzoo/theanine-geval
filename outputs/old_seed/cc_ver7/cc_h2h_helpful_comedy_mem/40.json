    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 contains specific information about Co-worker A's passion for singing and their involvement in a singing competition, which directly relates to the last line of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Co-worker A brings up their love for singing. This memory provides relevant context that would enable Co-worker B to respond appropriately to Co-worker A's mention of singing, possibly by discussing the competition or supporting Co-worker A in that area. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, primarily revolves around general work-related topics and does not include the singing aspect, making it less helpful for the context.\n\nChoice: 2"
