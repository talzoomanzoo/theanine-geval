Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \nSpeaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on?\nSpeaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying.
