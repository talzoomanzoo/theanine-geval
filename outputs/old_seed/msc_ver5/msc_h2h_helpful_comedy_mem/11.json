    "prediction": "Explanation: To select the more helpful memory, we need to assess which one provides the most relevant and useful context for Speaker B to respond appropriately to Speaker A's question about martial arts recommendations. Memory 1 focuses more on Speaker A's interests and past interactions between the two, such as movie recommendations and language learning. While it does mention Speaker B's interest in karate, it is less focused on the specifics that would be helpful in this context. Memory 2, on the other hand, provides detailed information about Speaker B's experience in karate, their green belt status, and how their football background contributes to their karate practice. This information is directly relevant to Speaker B suggesting a martial art for Speaker A, as it highlights Speaker B's expertise in karate and physical awareness, thereby enabling a more informed recommendation.\n\nChoice: 2"
