    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nUser Description: Speaker A is a high school student who is going to college, has achieved straight A's, runs a lot, likes burgers after a run, listens to music on weekends, finds listening to music like meditation, and needs music to stay sane. Their parents are blue collar workers, with their dad working long hours in factories. \n\nRelationship Description: Speaker A and Speaker B share a close relationship, discussing topics like getting a dog, dogs with hearing issues, and sharing meals like hamburgers and ham soup.\n\nEvent Description: Speaker A and Speaker B have engaged in conversations about getting a dog, discussing the challenges of having dogs with hearing issues, sharing meals like hamburgers and ham soup, and joking about trying a casserole invented by Speaker B. Speaker B has also shared information about their night job cooking hamburgers and feeding lab rats at a research lab.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nSpeaker A enjoys running and listening to music as hobbies. Speaker A offers to take Sparky for a walk to help out and spend time with the dog. Speaker A is considering getting a dog and already walks Speaker B's dog, Sparky. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try. \nSpeaker B is also a high school student preparing for college, working at a diner at night. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context discusses topics like working in a lab, cloning cows, and eating plant-based burgers. The relevant memory should contain information that supports this conversation, particularly focusing on Speaker B's work at a lab and their interest in food and cooking, which can be related to the conversation about different types of burgers.\n\nMEMORY 1 provides context about Speaker B working in a research lab, having a cooking-related night job, and feeding lab rats, which relate to the ongoing conversation about working in a lab and cloning cows. It also shows a close relationship between Speaker A and B, making the encouragement more meaningful. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 contains information about Speaker B working at a diner, which is less directly related to the context of working in a lab with cloned cows, but more about casual cooking. However, MEMORY 2 misses the connection to the lab work context.\n\nChoice: 1"
