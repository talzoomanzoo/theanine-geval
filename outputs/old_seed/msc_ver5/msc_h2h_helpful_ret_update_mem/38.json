What kind of project are you working on?\nSpeaker B: I'm sure the student appreciate that. You teach as a group as apposed to one-on-one right? And one of the companies I work for had their system hit with a virus so I've been upgraded their software to debug the system.\nSpeaker A: I teach group classes and one on one, but I was the student today. I specialize in jiu-jitsu but today I got to be the student in a taekwondo class. \nSpeaker B: That's even better, learning is a life-long journey. How are you class on martial art history? When you have time teach me too, I'd love to learn. \nSpeaker A: It's been a little stressful lately, because finals are coming up...but I'm confident in that class.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides information that directly relates to Speaker A's martial arts interest and career, Speaker B's software work, and Speaker B's interest in martial arts education. This is relevant as Speaker B expressed a desire to learn martial arts from Speaker A. MEMORY 2 also contains relevant information about Speaker A's martial arts involvement and academic pursuits, but it doesn't specifically mention Speaker B's involvement in software work and the recent online class about martial arts history, which would help Speaker B relate to Speaker A's situation of being stressed about finals.\n\nChoice: 1"
