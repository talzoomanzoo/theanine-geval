Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\nSpeaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing? \nSpeaker B: He's doing well! He just finished theatre camp and he's fighting with my sister because he wants to dye his hair green hahaha.\nSpeaker A: Young people today really have different values than our generation had. Acting sounds like it would be personally rewarding. I also like the arts. I play guitar and piano. You mentioned that you have a poll. That sounds refreshing in the hot weather.\nSpeaker B: Yes it's great, but it hasn't stopped raining here! How's the weather where you are? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n2. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation.\n4. Both Speaker A's mother and Speaker A were librarians, but Speaker A is retired.\n5. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n6. Speaker B asks if the recommended book is fiction or nonfiction.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation.\nSpeaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\nSpeaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break, and wants to go on a trip but has not started packing yet.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: In the dialogue, Speaker B has already purchased plane tickets for a trip to Costa Rica and expresses excitement about it. Speaker A should respond appropriately to this context and perhaps follow up on details related to the trip or discuss elements relevant to traveling or the weather since it was brought up in the last utterance. MEMORY 1 contains details about Speaker B planning a trip but hasn't packed yet and another point about the weather (raining), which is directly linked to the last question from Speaker B about the weather. MEMORY 2 lacks additional relevant context that would guide Speaker A's response to the last question, focusing instead on earlier plans for spring break and unrelated excitement about Easter.\n\nChoice: 1"
