    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\nSpeaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout.\n2. Speaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat.\n3. Speaker B is a member of the boy scouts and works at a fast food place\n4. Speaker B plans to earn the Eagle Scout badge for college applications.\n5. Speaker B is busy with scouts, school, work, and tennis, but willing to take vacation days for the retreat.\n6. Speaker A is involved in church activities and mentioned a church retreat\n\nMEMORY 2:\nSpeaker B is involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout. \nSpeaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat. \nSpeaker B is considering attending a local community college for the first couple of years.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context revolves around Speaker A learning about the benefits of Boy Scouts for kids, especially learning survival and social skills. Speaker B confirms these benefits and suggests involving Speaker A's kids in Boy Scouts. The helpful memory would provide relevant information about Speaker B's experience with Boy Scouts, which could further enable Speaker A to consider or follow up on the suggestion.\n\nMemory 1 includes more detailed information about Speaker B’s involvement in Boy Scouts, including current status (Life Scout), plans (earning the Eagle Scout badge), and commitments (busy with scouts, school, work, and tennis). This could help Speaker A understand Speaker B’s level of expertise and commitment to the program, making Speaker B’s suggestion to involve Speaker A’s kids in the scouts more credible.\n\nMemory 2 does mention Speaker B’s involvement in Boy Scouts, but lacks detailed context about the depth of their commitment or future scouting plans, which are relevant to the dialogue about the benefits of scouting.\n\nChoice: 1"
