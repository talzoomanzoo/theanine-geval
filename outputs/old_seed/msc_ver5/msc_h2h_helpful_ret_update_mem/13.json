    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make?\nSpeaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it.\nSpeaker A: I would love to, I enjoy cooking so maybe you can teach me to make it, too?\nSpeaker B: Yeah definitely! I know you like hot foods, so if you learn and can make them fresh it will taste amazing. Have you tried any new foods lately?\nSpeaker A: Not any new foods, but I did try a new food truck near me that was delicious! It was street tacos and you could pick from barbacoa, chicken, and steak for the protein. Do you like Mexican food? \nSpeaker B: Oh god I do love Mexican food. That was be so hard to pick because they're all so good! Did they have al pastor by any chance? I loved marinated pork tacos. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe.\n2. Speaker A likes cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally.\n3. Speaker A plays the drums and loves making food for others.\n4. Speaker A enjoys cooking and finds it helpful for stress relief.\n5. Speaker A cooked steak, fried potatoes, and shrimp for dinner with their father.\n6. Speaker B's hobbies include snowboarding, listening to music, singing, spending time with family, and cooking.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nSpeaker A enjoys cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally. This might be a great opportunity for Speaker B to teach them how to make spicy fried rice.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: When considering the helpfulness of each memory, it is important to see if it provides relevant context or background that informs Speaker A's current response or contributes to the ongoing discussion meaningfully. \n\nIn MEMORY 1, we get general information about Speaker B's enjoyment of cooking and family recipes, along with details about Speaker A's hobbies, none of which directly enhances the specific dialogue about Mexican food or teaching to cook spicy fried rice. \n\nMEMORY 2, however, offers a useful tie-in by noting Speaker A's interest in cooking new dishes and suggests this situation as an opportunity for Speaker B to teach them a new dish. Although it doesn't directly address the current question about al pastor, it still aligns more closely with the main topic of learning and sharing cooking experiences.\n\nChoice: 2"
