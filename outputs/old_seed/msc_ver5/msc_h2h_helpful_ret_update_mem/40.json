What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs!\nSpeaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours?\nSpeaker A: Ikea! Their furniture is not to expensive and they have all kinds of furniture that'll go with whatever scheme you're going for. What kind of patio furniture were you looking for? Like a barbeque, chairs, hammock? \nSpeaker B: I guess I was going to get like an umbrella table and some chairs to go with it or maybe even a screened in gazebo with a fire pit in the middle.\nSpeaker A: That's a great idea! Sounds like a very nice place for a barbeque. What were you planning on grilling for the barbeque? \nSpeaker B: I'll get the steaks to grill if you will bring the corn. And I have a request for you to play on the guitar, I know you are into country so if you could maybe play a song or two by Miranda Lambert, that would be awesome. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1.

Speaker A is excited about spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights. \nSpeaker A likely lives on a corn farm.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT mentions specific details such as planning a barbeque with steaks and corn, preferences for music from Miranda Lambert, and choosing furniture from Ikea for a patio. While both MEMORIES have relevant information about the barbeque and furniture discussions, MEMORY 2 contains additional context, such as Speaker A likely living on a corn farm. This detail is directly relevant to Speaker B's request for Speaker A to bring the corn, thus making it more helpful for Speaker A's response.\n\nChoice: 2"
