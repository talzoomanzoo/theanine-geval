    "prediction": "Explanation: The helpfulness of the MEMORY is determined by its ability to provide information that is relevant to the current topic of discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which in this case is about travel experiences in Europe and specifically Speaker A's travels. MEMORY 1 does not offer any relevant information about Speaker A's prior travels. MEMORY 2 also does not directly mention Speaker A's travel experiences, however, it provides more context on the outdoors, surfing, and the connection with Europe, all of which might be relevant to travel given the similarity in leisure activities. Nonetheless, neither of the memories directly adds new information about Speaker A's travel experiences in Europe. Therefore, both have limited helpfulness in the current context.\n\nChoice: tie"
