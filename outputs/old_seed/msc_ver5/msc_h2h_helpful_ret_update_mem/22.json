Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\nSpeaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\nSpeaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\nSpeaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.\nSpeaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe?\nSpeaker B: There is some weird chemical mix that I really do not mess with.  It is easy to clean up.  I try to stay away from this part of the movies.  I know what it should look like and that we want to keep everyone safe when using the fake blood.\nSpeaker A: Chemicals!  Do the actors hate working with it then?  I can imagine they are a pretty high maintenance bunch.  Do they worry about the blood messing with their looks?\nSpeaker B: Our actors are pretty amateur.  No big name ones so they are really good to work with.  Hey, how about you?  How is your interview practice going?  I am pretty sure you be excellent during it!\nSpeaker A: I think this discussion is helping me with making small talk, so thanks.  I just have to try and remember who i am and try to sell my good points.\nSpeaker B: That is a good approach.  I suppose you have been doing research on the company you are interviewing with?  I find it always helps to know the company as best you can for an interview.\nSpeaker A: Yes. Thanks for the reminder.  I have a couple of more companies to research today.
