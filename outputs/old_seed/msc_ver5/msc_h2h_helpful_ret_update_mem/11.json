    "prediction": "Explanation: The last utterance by Speaker A is seeking a suggestion on which martial art to try. Memory 1 mentions that Speaker B practices karate and holds a green belt, which is directly relevant to Speaker A's query about martial arts. Additionally, it provides context on Speaker B's athletic background and interest in karate, but without overwhelming details unrelated to the martial arts topic. Memory 2, while containing relevant information about karate, also includes extraneous details about Speaker B's job as a lifeguard, which are not pertinent to the current discussion about martial arts. Moreover, the discussion focus is more clearly aligned in Memory 1, without diverging into unrelated professional considerations of Speaker B.\n\nChoice: 1"
