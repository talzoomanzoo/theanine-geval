    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well?\nSpeaker B: The older one seems to like it while the youngest cannot be bothered. Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon?\nSpeaker A: Yes!  As a matter of fact, I'm visiting my son that lives in Spain next month.  This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now!\nSpeaker B: Oh nice. You must be looking forward to it. He must have told you a lot about her. Do you think you would like her?\nSpeaker A: I think so.  She seems like a very sweet girl and she seems to care deeply about my son, so that's what matters most.  You know, maybe I can stop by and visit you as well, since you live in Europe.  France, Spain, Italy?  Where are you living now? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker A has two sons who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next.\n2. Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe.\n3. Speaker B's younger son would be jealous of Speaker A's sons' European tour.\n4. Speaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite worrying about them traveling far away.\n5. Speaker A is a family man who loves spending time with his sons.\n6. Speaker B has two sons, one of whom has had a girlfriend for several years and the other is secretive.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nSpeaker A's sons have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next. They will be coming for winter break from Europe. \nSpeaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite worrying about them traveling far away. Speaker A's sons play video games and listen to music in their rooms.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The MEMORY that best aids Speaker B's response to the context should include information relevant to Speaker B's current whereabouts to answer Speaker A's question about where they live in Europe. MEMORY 1 mentions Speaker B could have a jealous son, which is potentially interesting but not as immediately relevant to Speaker A's query about Speaker B's location.\n\nChoice: Neither MEMORY 1 nor MEMORY 2 directly answer Speaker A's query about Speaker B's location in Europe, but MEMORY 1 is slightly more relevant as it includes information about their sons, which is a related topic to the discussion. However, based on the criterion of usefulness and relevance to the immediate question, both memories fall short, leading to a choice of \"tie\"."
