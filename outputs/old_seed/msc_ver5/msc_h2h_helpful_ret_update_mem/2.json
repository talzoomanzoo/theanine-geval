    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting! \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\n2. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n3. Speaker B is considering giving up their night job to focus on lab work and school.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the challenges and rewards of having a dog with hearing issues.\n6. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nSpeaker B, a high school student preparing for college, works at a diner at night but is considering giving up their job to focus on lab work and school. Additionally, Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, displaying an interest in neuroscience. Speaker A offers to take Sparky for a walk to help out and spend time with the dog, as Speaker B's dog is deaf and needs to be kept on a lead due to recall difficulties.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The context of the dialogue involves Speaker B's involvement in a lab, specifically regarding the cloning of a cow. MEMORY 1 contains relevant information such as Speaker B's plan to focus on lab work by giving up their night job and their interest in neuroscience, but it doesn't clarify their high school status or sparky's walking, which are somewhat distractive. MEMORY 2, although similar, gives unnecessary details about Sparky which do not contribute to the context of cloning a cow. MEMORY 1 has more directly relevant points like Speaker B being a molecular biology major, which aligns more closely with the cloning discussion.\n\nChoice: 1"
