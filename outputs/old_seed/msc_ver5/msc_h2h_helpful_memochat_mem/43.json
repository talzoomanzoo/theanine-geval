    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 is more relevant to the current dialogue context because it involves a conversation about music preferences, specifically blues music, which is exactly what Speaker A mentioned in the dialogue context. This memory provides information that could lead to Speaker B suggesting a blues band or concert experience to Speaker A, thus continuing the conversation smoothly. Conversely, MEMORY 2 is unrelated to the current subject of discussion and does not offer any continuity to the topic of enjoying blues music on a new iPhone.\n\nChoice: 1"
