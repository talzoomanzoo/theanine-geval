He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies!\nSpeaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?  \nSpeaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere!\nSpeaker B: You have a point.  It is nice to see puppies wagging their tail and just following you!  Changing topics, do you have any recipes with asparagus?  You know, it's such a popular vegetable, but I just don't know how to prepare it.\nSpeaker A: I don't have recipes but I know how to make a good grilled asparagus. Are you looking to bolster your chef book?\nSpeaker B: I sure am!  Grilled asparagus does sound good.  Do you pair the grilled asparagus with your fajitas?  What do you prefer, chicken or beef fajitas?\nSpeaker A: I prefer chicken to beef. I pair it with beef fajitas andI think it's great to have with a glass of merlot. Do you like wine?\nSpeaker B: You're making me hungry!  Yes, I do love wine.  As a matter of fact, I used to live in the Bordeaux region in France, so my favorite wine is Bordeaux wine.  But I also love champagne and cognac.\nSpeaker A: Haha, I know right? I lived in the Champagne region for a bit! Always wanted to go to Bordeaux. How was it there?\nSpeaker B: I didn't know that you also lived in France for a while!  I love French food, especially the bread and fruit pastries.  Living in Bordeaux was fun!  I had the chance to visit all the prehistoric caves with paintings in the Southwest region of France.  Plus, Spain was just a few hours away by train, so I visited Spain quite a few times as well.  Oh, the good old times.  If only I were this excited about my career!\nSpeaker A: The French have the best food I have ever eaten plus the life style is so chill! I miss going to the bakeries in the mornings to get freshly baked baguettes and croissants. If you become a chef you could travel to different countries and workright? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Potential Career Paths', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A suggests different career paths to Speaker B and they discuss working in the culinary field.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: I'm not really sure.
