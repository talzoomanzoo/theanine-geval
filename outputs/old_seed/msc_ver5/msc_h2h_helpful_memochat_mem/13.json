What was it like growing up?  Did she always fix huge meals when you visited? ### Speaker B: Yep. She was definitely the matriarch and kept us together with family dinners. Whenever we'd go over, it would be about 12 of us, with my parents, uncles and aunts, and two of my cousins. We'd pitch in in different ways but grandma was the boss. Come to think of it, I'm not sure I ever visited her and not smelled something in the kitchen as soon as we got in. That garlic chicken especially was a staple.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it?

    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 is more useful as it provides more context about the garlic chicken, linking it to a family recipe and the possibility of sharing said recipes. This directly ties into Speaker A's interest in cooking and learning new recipes, complementing the conversation about trying new foods and possibly learning to make spicy dishes. Memory 2 repeats information already present in the dialogue context without adding value or new insights relevant to the conversation. \n\nChoice: 1"
