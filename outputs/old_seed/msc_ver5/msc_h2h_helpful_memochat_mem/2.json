That's really exciting! \n\nMEMORY 1:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Work and School Plans', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B discuss their future plans regarding school, work, and potential job opportunities.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: You bet! How's the lab work going? Are you learning anything new with the research? ### Speaker B: We just did some interesting new things on genome sequencing.  We are going to try to clone a jersey cow next year. ### Speaker A: That's intense. How much longer do you have left in school? I'm just a freshman but I'm trying to get through it all in 3 years. ### Speaker B: Just two more weeks! I'm thinking about taking classes this summer to get a head start on my freshman year at college though. ### Speaker A: I did that my first summer and recommend it, you make such a close group of friends with your classmates! And it knocks a class off your schedule, which is also nice ### Speaker B: Yes!  I may have to give up my night job though.  They have told me at the lab they would be able to give me more hours there in the fall, which will help.  Especially since i want to major in molecular biology! ### Speaker A: So what I'm hearing is that I better come get some of that casserole ASAP lol' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow?

That's really exciting! ### \n\n``` Speaker A Input:\n\nMEMORY 2:\nSpeaker B, a high school student preparing for college, works at a diner at night but is considering giving up their job to focus on lab work and school. Additionally, Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, displaying an interest in neuroscience. Speaker A offers to take Sparky for a walk to help out and spend time with the dog, as Speaker B's dog is deaf and needs to be kept on a lead due to recall difficulties.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 directly mentions the cloning of a jersey cow, which aligns with the topic of Speaker A's question about working in the lab when they clone the cow. It also provides context about Speaker B's connection to lab work and future academic plans, which are relevant to the continuation of lab work mentioned in Speaker A's question. MEMORY 2, while it gives some background on Speaker B, does not directly relate to the specific subject of the lab work or cloning, making it less relevant for an appropriate response to Speaker A's inquiry.\n\nChoice: 1"
