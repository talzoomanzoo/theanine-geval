    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\nSpeaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach?\nSpeaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\n3. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n4. Speaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\n5. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n6. Speaker A is studying computer science and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nSpeaker B wants to turn their linguistics major into a practical job, while Speaker A wants to develop apps for differently abled youth through studying computer science. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics. \nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science, while Speaker B is considering further education to become a college professor in linguistics, feeling limited in job opportunities.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context revolves around conversations about teaching and career paths related to Speaker B's interest in English and history and Speaker A's aspirations in robotics. Both memories provide similar information, but neither directly addresses Speaker B's consideration of teaching English or history. However, Memory 1 provides specific insights into Speaker Bâ€™s study of linguistics and limited job opportunities, which aligns with the teaching discussion. Additionally, Memory 1 presents potential further education for Speaker B, which relates indirectly to teaching aspirations discussed.\n\nChoice: 1"
