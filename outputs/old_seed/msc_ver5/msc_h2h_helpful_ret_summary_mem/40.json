Sounds like a very nice place for a barbeque. What were you planning on grilling for the barbeque? \nSpeaker B: I'll get the steaks to grill if you will bring the corn. And I have a request for you to play on the guitar, I know you are into country so if you could maybe play a song or two by Miranda Lambert, that would be awesome. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1.

    "prediction": "Explanation: In this dialogue context, Speaker B asks Speaker A to play a Miranda Lambert song at their barbecue. The helpfulness of the memory will be determined based on how well it supports Speaker A in responding to this request. Memory 1 mentions the grilling preference (charcoal grill) and includes details about plans to grill steaks, which could be useful for responding to the barbecue-related part of the conversation and understanding the setting. However, neither memory directly addresses the request to play Miranda Lambert songs. Memory 2 provides similar information about grilling preferences but also adds a detail about Speaker A likely living on a corn farm, which is not directly relevant to the current conversation or request.\n\nChoice: 1"
