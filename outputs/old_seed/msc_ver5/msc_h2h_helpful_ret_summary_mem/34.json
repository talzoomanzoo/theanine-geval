    "prediction": "Explanation: The key aspect of this Dialogue Context is that Speaker A discusses having a break from watching their grandkids and checking out a new book. Speaker B is curious whether the book was exciting. Thus, relevance to books or reading habits would be most helpful. Both memories mention Speaker A's grandchildren and interests, but MEMORY 2 more directly connects reading and having a break, thus providing context to help Speaker A respond about their interest in books or reading.\n\nChoice: 2"
