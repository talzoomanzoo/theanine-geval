    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet? \nSpeaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name?\nSpeaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \nSpeaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along!\nSpeaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them.\nSpeaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me!\nSpeaker A: Hahaha. Yes I agree its too hot to get a long hike in. I've been on some short ones, but the bugs eat me alive. I like to hike in the fall when the bugs are dying off and its a little cooler.\nSpeaker B: Ah yes, that's my favorite time of year. Oh and speaking of Tasha, I'm still amazed she knows Mandarin. Have you been learning more of the language?\nSpeaker A: I've been learning a little more. I try to learn a few things a day. Tasha's reactions to my talking to myself in Mandarin is funny, she looks confused most of the time.\nSpeaker B: That is funny. And impressive that you're learning. The closest I can get to another language is doing a bad New York accent LOL \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker A has a pet named Tasha who speaks Mandarin.\n2. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n3. Speaker A has been learning Mandarin and Tasha has started saying Chinese phrases instead of English ones.\n4. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n5. Speaker B finds it amusing that Tasha speaks Mandarin and mutters things under her breath.\n6. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nSpeaker B loves animals, lives in the city they grew up in, and has a cat that recently had a kitten. This led Speaker B to have two sick kitties and recently receive a rescue. Speaker A, on the other hand, has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n\nSpeaker A, a country girl who loves animals and is a lacto-ovo vegetarian, now has a pet named Tasha who speaks Mandarin. As a result, Speaker A has been learning Mandarin, and Tasha has started saying Chinese phrases instead of English ones. This has led Speaker A to be interested in adopting a rescue kitten, similar to Speaker B.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides specific information about Speaker A's pet, Tasha, and its Mandarin-speaking ability, which is directly relevant to the current topic of the conversation regarding Tasha and learning Mandarin. MEMORY 2 gives additional background information about Speaker B, including details about their love for animals and living situation, which is less directly related to the ongoing conversation about Tasha and language learning. Therefore, MEMORY 1 is more useful and relevant for responding to the last utterance in the dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 1"
