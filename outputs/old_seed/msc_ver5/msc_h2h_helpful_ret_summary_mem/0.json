    "prediction": "Explanation: The main focus of the dialogue is centered around traveling, specifically Speaker B's trip to Costa Rica. They discuss travel experience and plans for duration of stay. Memory 1 provides detail about Speaker B's excitement about the trip and their travel preparations. Memory 2 contains similar information but introduces new topics such as hair dying, colored hair, and Speaker A's grandchildren, which do not pertain to the travel-focused dialogue. Therefore, Memory 1 is more helpful due to its more relevant focus on the travel context.\n\nChoice: 1"
