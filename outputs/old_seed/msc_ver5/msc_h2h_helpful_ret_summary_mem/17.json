Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too?\nSpeaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also?\nSpeaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways?\nSpeaker B: They've been better as I left my previous job so I'm spending more time with them, how do you manage to work full time and still keep those animals happy?\nSpeaker A: I think working at the zoo so long has helped. Why did you leave your last job. Was that the one you were working in the warehouse? Sorry to hear about your dogs, it can be hard managing older animals. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker A has penguins at the zoo and enjoys working with animals, offering Speaker B a chance to help out.\n2. Speaker B has elderly terriers and is planning to leave their part-time job for a break before starting a new one.\n3.

Speaker A mentions having dogs and Speaker B admires them for their peaceful nature. Speaker B asks Speaker A if they have had a pet raccoon before.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains details that are particularly relevant to the current conversation, such as Speaker A working at a zoo and the idea of Speaker B potentially getting an entry-level job there. This links directly to Speaker A's question about why Speaker B left their last job and also to the previous question from Speaker B about how Speaker A manages to work full time and keep animals happy, since work experience at the zoo is implied to be the reason. It also mentions the idea of the peaceful nature of Speaker A's dogs, which ties into the current discussion about behavior of dogs, especially regarding food. MEMORY 2, while containing useful information, is more disjointed and doesn't tie back to the specific current points of conversation quite as effectively or directly. \n\nChoice: 1"
