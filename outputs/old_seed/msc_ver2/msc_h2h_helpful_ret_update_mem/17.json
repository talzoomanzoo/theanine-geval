Did your daughter like that place?\nSpeaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping?\nSpeaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp?\nSpeaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer?\nSpeaker A: I've only camped in a tent so far, but would like to try out a camper trailer. What do use for camping?\nSpeaker B: We usually do tents but we have camped in yurts too. Did you go to the zoo last weekend?\nSpeaker A: I see. Yes, I did make it to the zoo.  Have you gone to your local zoo? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities. This is why Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys. In contrast, Speaker B's daughter likes monkeys and is starting to assert her independence. On a similar note, Speaker B is interested in finding family discounts for the zoo as well as pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n2. Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys.\n3. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n4. Speaker A suggests taking the pets to the zoo and mentions that most major cities have good zoos.\n5. Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys.\n6. Speaker B is interested in finding family discounts for the zoo.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 contain similar pieces of information about both speakers' interests and plans regarding the zoo. However, MEMORY 1 provides additional context regarding Speaker B's daughter's interest in monkeys and her independence, which could be relevant to the conversation. MEMORY 2 includes extraneous information such as Speaker A suggesting taking pets to the zoo, which is not directly useful for the current conversation. Thus, MEMORY 1 is slightly more helpful with relevant details about Speaker B's family.\n\nChoice: 1"
