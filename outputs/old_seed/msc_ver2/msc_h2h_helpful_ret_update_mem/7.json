Sometimes, it's very peaceful to get away from everything.\nSpeaker A: No, I don't have any pets; my apartment seems too small for a dog and I would worry about them being lonely all day when I'm at work. I was thinking about getting a pair of cats, but I haven't committed yet. How nice fo ryou to have company when you're walking though! What kind of dog do you have?\nSpeaker B: Cats can be nice!

    "prediction": "Explanation: When determining which MEMORY is more helpful, it should provide relevant context that relates to the last topic of discussion, which is Speaker B's dog and how they enjoy walking them on harder trails. Both MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 share some helpful insights into Speaker B's love for nature and working with animals, which aligns with their mention of the dog. However, MEMORY 2 includes more relevant information about Speaker B's experience with nature walks and finding inspiration in them, which relates back to the current conversation about enjoying walks with the dog.\n\nChoice: 2"
