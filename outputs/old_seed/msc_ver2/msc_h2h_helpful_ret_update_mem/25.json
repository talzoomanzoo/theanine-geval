Speaker B lives in the city they grew up in, loves animals, and has a cat that recently had a kitten.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more helpful because it includes the specific information that Speaker A has previously suggested a name for one of the kittens, \"Zhao.\" This is directly relevant to the current conversation about naming a kitten and allows Speaker A to possibly revisit or compare the suggested names, providing a more informed response. MEMORY 1 doesn't include this specific information about Speaker A's past involvement in suggesting names, making it less directly useful to the immediate context of discussing kitten names.\n\nChoice: 2"
