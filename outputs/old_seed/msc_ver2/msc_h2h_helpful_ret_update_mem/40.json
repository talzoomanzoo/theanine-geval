I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. \nSpeaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me.\nSpeaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context indicates a conversation where Speaker A is trying to deal with raccoons accessing their garbage and does not want the animals coming around due to disease risks. Both Memory 1 and Memory 2 provide context about Speaker A dealing with a raccoon problem and Speaker B's connection to raccoons. However, Memory 2 includes relevant details like Speaker A's concern about raccoons potentially eating their bearded dragon, which directly relates to the risks associated with having raccoons around. This additional detail is useful in understanding Speaker A's stance.\n\nChoice: 2"
