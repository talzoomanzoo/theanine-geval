    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. \nSpeaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me.\nSpeaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house. \nSpeaker B: Understandable. Have you ever tried contacting animal control? That's how I got Bandicoot. I was working that day and animal control came by explaining about needing fosters for raccoons. I thought it was weird, so I did it and began to work at the small raccoon cafe that is part of the zoo. I love it. \nSpeaker A: That is a good idea.  Maybe they could help move them to a safer area.  I have a lot of traffic around and they could get hit if they are coming to my place all the time.  Have you been able to teach your raccoon any tricks? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A finds working in software solutions for tech companies less exciting than being a zoo keeper. Speaker A has not interacted closely with raccoons but admires them. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n\nSpeaker B works as a zoo keeper and enjoys it. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly. Speaker B's garbage has a lock to prevent animals from getting into it, especially during windy weather. Speaker B owns a raccoon named Bandicoot and a bearded dragon named Bob.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n2. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly.\n3. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n4. Bandicoot was a rescue and has been at the Raccoon Cafe since he was a baby.\n5. Speaker A hears raccoons and cats fighting in their neighborhood.\n6. Speaker B mentioned that raccoons cannot legally be sold as pets, but can be rescued and cared for before being released back into the wild.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The last utterance from Speaker A in the dialogue context asks Speaker B if they have taught their raccoon any tricks. Memory 2 provides relevant and related information about Speaker B's interest in training Bandicoot, which aligns directly with Speaker A's question. This makes it more helpful for Speaker B to respond appropriately to the inquiry regarding teaching tricks. Memory 1, while offering some context about the raccoon being cared for, does not specifically address the training aspect.\n\nChoice: 2"
