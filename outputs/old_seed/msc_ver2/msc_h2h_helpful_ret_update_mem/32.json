If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \nSpeaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with?\nSpeaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point.\nSpeaker A: Yes, it contains eggs.  I think you would do well with the fried rice. It's best to cook the rice the day before.   \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A enjoys cooking and baking, possibly considering turning it into a business. This is similar to Speaker B's husband, who is a great cook and enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work. Speaker B, on the other hand, is not skilled in cooking but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker. In addition, Speaker B also mentions having a farm with animals like chickens, ducks, pigs, goats, and growing crops like corn, strawberries, and pumpkins. This resonates with Speaker A, who owns a farm and enjoys cooking and baking. This has led Speaker A to become a cook and enjoy using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work.\n2. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker.\n3.
