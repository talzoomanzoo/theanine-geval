    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B is from Sweden and mentioned playing tennis and going to church on Sunday. This reminds Speaker A that they have a cousin in Sweden but have not visited the country yet. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip. Speaker B recommends checking out the volcanoes in Sweden for a unique experience.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n4. Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n5. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n6. Speaker B's parents still live in Sweden, and they find it expensive to travel there.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: When judging which MEMORY is more helpful, we should evaluate which memory provides Speaker B with more context and relevance to facilitate a meaningful response to Speaker A's statement about planning their trip to Sweden.\n\nChoice: 2\n\nMEMORY 2 contains multiple points about Speaker B's personal connection to Sweden, such as their fond memories, the high expenses associated with visiting, and the fact that their parents live there. This context could allow Speaker B to offer more nuanced advice or share personal experiences that might be valuable to Speaker A's planning. \n\nIn contrast, MEMORY 1 mainly mentions an activity (checking out volcanoes in Sweden), which is less relevant compared to the emotional and practical details in MEMORY 2, which directly relate to Speaker B's experiences and opinions about Sweden as well."
