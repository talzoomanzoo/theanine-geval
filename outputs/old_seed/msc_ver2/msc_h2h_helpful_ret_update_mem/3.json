    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A enjoys running and listening to music as hobbies. Speaker A offers to take Sparky for a walk to help out and spend time with the dog. Speaker A is considering getting a dog and already walks Speaker B's dog, Sparky. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try. \nSpeaker B is also a high school student preparing for college, working at a diner at night. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner.\n2. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n4. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n5. Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\n6. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 contains specific information that connects Speaker B's interest in lab work and molecular biology, which directly relates to the topic of cloning mentioned in the dialogue. It also highlights Speaker B's commitment to balancing work and studies, adding depth to their decision-making process about quitting the lab. This background is relevant to the current conversation. MEMORY 1, while containing some similar elements, lacks the specific connection between Speaker Bâ€™s interests and their work in the lab, particularly in neuroscience and molecular biology, which make them more relevant to the context of cloning cows.\n\nChoice: 2"
