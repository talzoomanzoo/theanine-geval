It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B is on their way to college and studying sports medicine, feeling overwhelmed by their mother's strictness and eager to finish school to escape it.\nSpeaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject, causing them to feel pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\nSpeaker B has been getting all A's in the sports medicine class, which changed Speaker A's struggle to maintain good grades as they find gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Studying and Exams', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B talk about their studies, exams, and grades.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: No, definitely not.  Maybe you can make it out to one of my games sometime? ### Speaker B: I would love that. Hopefully I can make it this weekend. I have an exam on Friday and then hopefully I can make it there before your game. ### Speaker A: Which exam?  I had a history test last week and it was horrible.  I wish my teacher was better, or at least made the topic interesting.  It's so boring in his class that I have a hard time paying attention. ### Speaker B: It is for my sport medicine. It is the last one of the class I have made A's all year so hopefully I can pass this one also and I'll be done. ### Speaker A: Oh nice!  I wish that I could get all A's.  I'm more of a B and occasional C student.  The only guaranteed A I have is in gym, haha ### Speaker B: I think everyone gets an A in gym. I have studied really hard to get those As I want to pass with good grades. I figure it would help me get a good job afterwards. ### Speaker A: I'm sure it will.  My sister got good grades in school and ended up with a great teaching job.  I know it's not the same, but it definitely helped her.  I still am hoping that I can get a soccer scholarship, because there's no way that I'll get one for my academics. ### Speaker B: Just keep at it and try your hardest. You never know you might surprise yourself' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? ###Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season.
