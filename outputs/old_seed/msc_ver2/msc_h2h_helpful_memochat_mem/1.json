It might help if we put on some punk music before we get in the pool. ### Speaker B: Before during and after! I won't debate you on that. How are you liking this new job? I've always wanted to learn programming. ### Speaker A: It is a bit tedious and repetitive, but rewarding when the job is complete. Swimming helps me relax because it is a bit stressful at times. ### Speaker B: I can imagine. I eat pizzaburgers when Im stressed and I'm stressed a lot. Thats Why I'm thinking I cou;ld learn how to swim now. I'm pretty buoyant if you know what I mean ### Speaker A: haha. Bouyant is a good thing. It will help you float on your back. How about I teach you programming too? For ever hour in water, and hour of training for progrramming? ### Speaker B: And punk music!!!
