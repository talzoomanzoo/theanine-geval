Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\nSpeaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient! \nSpeaker A: Wow, that gives me a completely different perspective. You'd really be ok with seeing me? You don't think it would be a conflict of interest since we're friends?\nSpeaker B: No not at all but if you didn't feel comfortable talking to me I can recommend a couple of my colleagues who are just as brilliant\nSpeaker A: I'd prefer to see you since I'm already comfortable talking to you! It will get the awkward part out of the way for me! \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B enjoys being around horses while working at a stable, which is why they are considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories. Speaker B has been working in their own therapy practice for about six years, experiencing the ups and downs of the profession. This led to Speaker B becoming a professional in a practice where it is illegal for them to have relationships with clients.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'experience in practice', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker B talks about their training and experience in their therapy practice.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: I had to train for a while with other people before I was fully certified and licensed, but I've now been working in my own practice for about six years.

    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 contains information about Speaker B's enjoyment of being around horses and their experience in their therapy practice, but it also mentions aspects that may not be directly relevant to the ongoing conversation, such as discussing Freudian theories and relationships with clients being illegal. Memory 2, on the other hand, pertains more directly to Speaker B's experience and training as a therapist, which is relevant to the conversation about therapy and fits the context of Speaker B having a practice and potentially taking on Speaker A as a client.\n\nChoice: 2"
