Have you gone to your local zoo? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities. This is why Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys. In contrast, Speaker B's daughter likes monkeys and is starting to assert her independence.

They do have kitty daycares too! ### Speaker B: THat's true. I'd feel a little bit bad about shipping her off somewhere for a night or two, I am sure she'd get confused.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: How was your trip?

    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 provides information about Speaker A's interest in zoos and Speaker B's daughter's interest in monkeys, as well as Speaker B's interest in family discounts and school trips to the zoo. This is directly relevant and helpful for Speaker B to engage in a conversation about zoos, considering Speaker A's recent visit to the zoo and the question about Speaker B's local zoo visits. Memory 2, on the other hand, provides more general information about visiting zoos and caring for pets, which is less useful for responding to the specific query about Speaker B's local zoo experiences.\n\nChoice: 1"
