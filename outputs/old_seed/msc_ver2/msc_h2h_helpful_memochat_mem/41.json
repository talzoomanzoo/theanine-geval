I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. \nSpeaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me.\nSpeaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house. \nSpeaker B: Understandable. Have you ever tried contacting animal control? That's how I got Bandicoot. I was working that day and animal control came by explaining about needing fosters for raccoons. I thought it was weird, so I did it and began to work at the small raccoon cafe that is part of the zoo. I love it. \nSpeaker A: That is a good idea.  Maybe they could help move them to a safer area.  I have a lot of traffic around and they could get hit if they are coming to my place all the time.  Have you been able to teach your raccoon any tricks? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A finds working in software solutions for tech companies less exciting than being a zoo keeper. Speaker A has not interacted closely with raccoons but admires them. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n\nSpeaker B works as a zoo keeper and enjoys it. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly. Speaker B's garbage has a lock to prevent animals from getting into it, especially during windy weather. Speaker B owns a raccoon named Bandicoot and a bearded dragon named Bob.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Fostering Animals and Raccoon Encounter', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A discusses fostering animals and dealing with raccoons while Speaker B shares experiences with Bandicoot the raccoon.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: One of my foster dogs is going to her forever home tomorrow, I'm excited for her but will be sad to see her go at the same time! ### Speaker B: I understand, it must be tough to give away a dog you have fostered for such a long time. Surely you still have other dogs to foster that have yet to be adopted? ### Speaker A: They always come and go. It's sad, but I am a little used to it. But you're right, I'm sure by next week another cutie will be joining me. You should bring bandicoot over! ### Speaker B: I'd be happy to do so, he would love the extra company and attention. Would you ever consider fostering other types of animals other than dogs, such as cats? ### Speaker A: I'm allergic to cats. That's why I don't foster them. Has he ever met a dog before? ### Speaker B: He has, he mostly is friendly around them, although I can't say many dogs are friendly around bandicoot. I guess dogs in general aren't really used to seeing racoons at times. ### Speaker A: Probably not. Or maybe they see them, and worry they are going to steal their food next! ### Speaker B: That is true of other racoons, but Bandicoot seems to play fair.

I would be scared if a bigger animal like a bear was attracted to my garbage. ### Speaker A: Luckily we don't have bears around. The other animals don't seem interested in the garage though. ### Speaker B: Good to hear, then aluminum sheeting should be able to handle just the raccoons then.

    "prediction": "Explanation: Given the last utterance in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, Speaker A asks if Speaker B has been able to teach their raccoon any tricks. MEMORY 1 offers relevant information that Speaker B works as a zoo keeper and owns a raccoon named Bandicoot, making it useful for Speaker B to respond appropriately about teaching tricks. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, primarily discusses fostering animals and garbage issues, which are less relevant to the question about teaching a raccoon tricks.\n\nChoice: 1"
