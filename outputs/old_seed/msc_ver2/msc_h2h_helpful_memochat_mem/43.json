    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context revolves around Speaker A mentioning a new book they are reading and a possible movie adaptation discussed with Speaker B. MEMORY 2 provides relevant background on book-to-screen adaptations, mentioning a specific example (\"The Shack\"), while also referencing other related conversations involving books and shows. This aligns well with the current dialogue's discussion on book-to-movie adaptations. MEMORY 1, however, focuses on Speaker A's grandchildren, Netflix preferences, and napping, which is not directly relevant to the immediate conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
