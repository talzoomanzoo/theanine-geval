I would be scared if a bigger animal like a bear was attracted to my garbage. ### Speaker A: Luckily we don't have bears around. The other animals don't seem interested in the garage though. ### Speaker B: Good to hear, then aluminum sheeting should be able to handle just the raccoons then.

    "prediction": "Explanation: \nMEMORY 1 is more helpful as it provides more personal and specific details about both Speaker A and Speaker B that are relevant to their conversation about raccoons and garbage management. It mentions Speaker B's experience with a raccoon, Bandicoot, and the fact that Speaker B uses a lock on their garbage. This information is directly related to the current conversation about dealing with raccoons. MEMORY 2, while still relevant, primarily summarizes previous related dialogues rather than offering new insights or personal experiences that could help Speaker B respond more contextually to Speaker A.\n\nChoice: 1"
