I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes.  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A's interest in animals, specifically raccoons and bearded dragons, was sparked by their work in software solutions for tech companies, which they find less exciting than being a zoo keeper. They are currently dealing with a raccoon problem and plan to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes. Additionally, Speaker B has been taking care of a raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Dealing with Garbage and Animal Intruders', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B talk about handling raccoons and other animals intruding in the garbage.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: Not yet. I need to buy some aluminum sheeting I think. To cover the holes up from the inside. Those raccoons are too smart ### Speaker B: True, racoons are much more craftier than you think. Has any other types of animals tried to enter your garbage, or is it mostly racoons? I would be scared if a bigger animal like a bear was attracted to my garbage. ### Speaker A: Luckily we don't have bears around. The other animals don't seem interested in the garage though. ### Speaker B: Good to hear, then aluminum sheeting should be able to handle just the raccoons then. My garbage has a lock, helps keep it shut especially when it gets very windy outside.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides information that might distract from the topic of discussing the raccoon problem and the aluminum sheeting, as it introduces an element of Speaker B caring for and potentially training a raccoon, which was not mentioned in the current dialogue. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 directly relates to the current conversation about handling raccoons with aluminum sheeting and builds on a previous relevant dialogue. It offers insights into previous discussions of animal intruders and specifically addresses the same issue of keeping raccoons out, making it much more aligned and useful for the dialogue about installing the aluminum sheeting.\n\nChoice: 2"
