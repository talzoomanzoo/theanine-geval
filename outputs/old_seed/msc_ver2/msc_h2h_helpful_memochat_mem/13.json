    "prediction": "Explanation: When considering which MEMORY is more helpful, we need to find the one that contains relevant information for Speaker A to use in response to Speaker B's mention of karate and their question about Speaker A's interest in martial arts classes. MEMORY 2 includes detailed information about Speaker B's involvement in karate, their experience level, and their challenges with attending classes consistently, which directly pertains to the context of martial arts and could be helpful in continuing the conversation. In contrast, MEMORY 1 contains more general background information about Speaker B, including their other interests and future plans, but it doesn't provide specific insights about their karate practice that would be more directly relevant to the current dialogue.\n\nChoice: 2"
