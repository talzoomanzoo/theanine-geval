Speaker A enjoys gardening and reading, while Speaker B enjoys visiting the zoo. Speaker B's girlfriend loves pandas and penguins at the zoo and they visit every few weeks. Speaker B's girlfriend has a noisy cockatoo and Speaker B is thinking about adopting a kitten from a friend.\n2. Speaker A prefers cockatoos over kittens as pets, reacting to Speaker B's girlfriend having a noisy cockatoo.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Pets and Animals', 'Related Summaries': 'Discussion about pets, including cats, dogs, and cockatoos.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: Cool! I have always wanted a cockatoo, but I've always been afraid that they would keep me awake at night or something while I am trying to sleep. Does hers make a lot of noise? ### Speaker B: Oh yeah you bet haha. Making sure the environment is really quiet helps them to calm though. Does your sister like animals too? ### Speaker A: Yeah, she is definitely a dog person. She has a yellow lab and they are best buds. ### Speaker B: Haha nice. I always thought about getting a dog, but cats are just so much easier. I'm thinking about getting another cat sometime next month actually. ### Speaker A: I was talking to a friend three days ago, and they mentioned they are giving away kittens that their cat just gave birth to. You should give them a call, and ask to adopt one. I am sure they would be happy to give you a kitten, given how well you take care of your cat. ### Speaker B: Oh my goodness that's so exciting! Yes I'll definitely give them a call, at least just to talk about it and see whether one of the kittens would be right for me. Would you consider getting one too?' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens? ### \n\n``` Speaker A Input:\nRecent Dialogs: Speaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens? ### \n\n``` Speaker A Input:\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 directly answers the question posed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT by providing specific information about Speaker B considering adopting a kitten from Speaker A's friend's recent litter. It also includes Speaker B's excitement about potentially getting the kitten, which is relevant to the context. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, provides less focused information about Speaker B's girlfriend's pets and preferences, which are less relevant to the specific question asked by Speaker A in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nChoice: 2"
