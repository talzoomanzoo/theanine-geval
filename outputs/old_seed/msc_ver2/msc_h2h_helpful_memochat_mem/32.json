If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \nSpeaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with?\nSpeaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point.\nSpeaker A: Yes, it contains eggs.  I think you would do well with the fried rice. It's best to cook the rice the day before.   \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A enjoys cooking and baking, possibly considering turning it into a business. This is similar to Speaker B's husband, who is a great cook and enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work. Speaker B, on the other hand, is not skilled in cooking but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker. In addition, Speaker B also mentions having a farm with animals like chickens, ducks, pigs, goats, and growing crops like corn, strawberries, and pumpkins. This resonates with Speaker A, who owns a farm and enjoys cooking and baking. This has led Speaker A to become a cook and enjoy using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Pressure Cooker and Cooking Tips', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A explains the use of a pressure cooker in cooking and provides tips on its benefits, recipes, and recommendations.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: What a tandoor? Is it similar to a pressure cooker? ### Speaker A: No, a tandoor is a special type of oven which they use in India to make tandoori chicken. It helps give it its flavour. It is made from clay. ### Speaker B: Oh I see! I've never used a pressure cooker before. Does it cook other things other than lentils? I hear it makes the cooking go much faster. ### Speaker A: Yes, you can do lots of things in pressure cookers like stews and soups. Most of the time, I use it to soften meat. I love putting my lamb shanks in there. It makes the meat fall right off the bone. Do you have a pressure cooker? ### Speaker B: I don't, but hearing what you're saying makes me want to purchase one for my husband. He's an avid cook but sometimes that makes the cooking process a lot longer than I want! ### Speaker A: I would recommend a pressure cooker. It is a great item for beginner cooks. You throw it all in, pop the lid on and wait for the whistle really. I gave one to my sister for Christmas and she uses more often than me now.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 both provide context about the cooking topic relevant to the dialogue. However, MEMORY 1 mentions that Speaker B has a farm and grows their own eggs, directly linking to Speaker B's interest in using their own eggs for the shrimp fried rice recipe, which is a focal point in the Dialogue Context. This connection makes MEMORY 1 more immediately useful in addressing the interest Speaker B showed in the last utterance. MEMORY 2, although it provides context about pressure cookers, doesn't directly address Speaker B's interest in growing their own eggs.\n\nChoice: 1"
