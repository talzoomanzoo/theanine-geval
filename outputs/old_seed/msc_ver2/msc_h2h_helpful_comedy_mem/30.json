    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 is more focused on academic performance and pressure related to maintaining grades, which ties into the current discussion about finals and exam preparation. It includes relevant information about the pressure to achieve high grades that Speaker B might be experiencing, which could make Speaker A's appreciation for the help more meaningful. Memory 2, while containing information about sports and personal interests, doesn't provide context about academic pressures or motivations that are presently being discussed in the dialogue context. Therefore, Memory 1 provides more relevant information that Speaker B can use to respond to Speaker A's need for study help.\n\nChoice: 1"
