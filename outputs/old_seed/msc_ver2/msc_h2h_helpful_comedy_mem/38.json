    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker A enjoys gardening and reading, while Speaker B enjoys visiting the zoo. Speaker B's girlfriend loves pandas and penguins at the zoo and they visit every few weeks. Speaker B's girlfriend has a noisy cockatoo and Speaker B is thinking about adopting a kitten from a friend.\n2. Speaker A prefers cockatoos over kittens as pets, reacting to Speaker B's girlfriend having a noisy cockatoo.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description: Speaker A is a hard-working individual who works at a local fast food restaurant. They enjoy reading and gardening, and have a preference for visiting the zoo. Speaker A has a sister who recently got married and they like to see pandas, penguins, and exotic birds at the zoo. \n\nRelationship Description: Speaker A and Speaker B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as seen when Speaker A suggested Speaker B to adopt a kitten and they discussed their preferences regarding pets. They also share a love for animals and enjoy visiting the zoo together.\n\nEvent Description: Speaker A's sister got married, Speaker B's cat had a kitten, Speaker A and Speaker B discussed their preferences for pets, Speaker B's girlfriend got a cockatoo, Speaker B mentioned about giving away kittens, Speaker A compared having children to having pets, and Speaker B's sister's cockatoo named John behaves in a funny way.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The goal is to find the memory that is most relevant and assists Speaker B in responding appropriately to Speaker A's inquiry about adopting a kitten.\n\nChoice: 1\n\nWhile both memories mention animals and pets, Memory 1 is more directly relevant to the current dialogue context as it specifically mentions Speaker B considering adopting a kitten from a friend, which aligns with Speaker A's question. Memory 2 provides background information about Speaker A and B's relationship and shared love for animals, but it does not directly mention Speaker B's current contemplation about adopting the kitten, making Memory 1 more helpful in this scenario."
