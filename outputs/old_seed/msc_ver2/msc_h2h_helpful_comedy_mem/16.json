    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?\nSpeaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping?\nSpeaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp?\nSpeaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer?\nSpeaker A: I've only camped in a tent so far, but would like to try out a camper trailer. What do use for camping? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A mentions starting their own zoo, comparing it to being a grandparent. This leads Speaker B's child to express interest in visiting the zoo, especially to see the monkeys. This topic continues as Speaker B, a parent, advocates for a school field trip to the zoo for their daughter.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nSpeaker A is a female with unknown hometown, occupation, education, and location. She is currently single and has a cat that recently had kittens. Speaker A loves iced tea and is starting her own zoo. She also mentioned she grew up in big cities and enjoyed visiting the zoo frequently. \n\nRelationship Description:\nSpeaker A followed Speaker B's advice and told her family about the kitten. Speaker B asked about it and they discussed going to the zoo together. Speaker B's child wants to go to the zoo and asked for recommendations on animal enclosures. They joked about calling in sick to work and going to the zoo instead.\n\nEvent Description:\nSpeaker A mentioned going to the zoo on a weekly basis and recommended the tiger and monkey enclosures. Speaker B mentioned considering family discounts for the zoo and joked about skipping work to go. Speaker A also mentioned taking photos of monkeys and expressed concerns about her child's growing independence. Speaker A also suggested getting a pet for Speaker B's daughter and mentioned kitty daycares.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is discussing camping and the types of accommodations used, such as tents and camper trailers. Speaker A asks Speaker B what they use for camping, indicating an upcoming discussion on camping-related activities or equipment preferences. Therefore, the memory that should be selected for helpfulness should provide relevant information that would enable Speaker B to continue this camping conversation effectively.\n\nMemory 1 focuses heavily on zoo visits, school field trips, and Speaker B's child's interest in visiting the zoo, which is unrelated to the camping topic at the center of the current conversation.\n\nMemory 2 also predominately covers content about zoo visits, pets, and related jokes, which again do not align with the ongoing conversation about camping preferences and experiences.\n\nGiven these points, neither memory directly assists Speaker B with relevant information about camping. However, Memory 2, due to its elaborate nature suggesting prior conversations about personal preferences and family advice (likely including camping preferences), has the potential for more context that might indirectly be useful, even though it's not explicitly mentioned in the given summary.\n\nChoice: 2"
