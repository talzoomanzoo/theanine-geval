Plus the color is beautiful orange. I want to see them together, even I am not a cat person they must be cute together at that time. Once the kitten grows up, situation gonna change to me. How are they, they are doing well?\nSpeaker A: Marmalade is orange too but this is better because the baby is sassy and climbs up my leg to sit on my shoulder.
