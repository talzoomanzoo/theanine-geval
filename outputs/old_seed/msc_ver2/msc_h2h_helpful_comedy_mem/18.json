    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context centers around camping and zoos, particularly Speaker B's preference for the Bronx Zoo and inquiries about Speaker A's zoo visits. Memory 1 is more helpful because it contains relevant information about zoo visits and Speaker B's daughter's interest in visiting the zoo, which connects directly with the conversational topic. Memory 2, on the other hand, contains less relevant information regarding the current topics discussed and focuses more on tangential aspects such as pet care and speaker backgrounds that are not immediately useful for the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 1"
