    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. \nSpeaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me.\nSpeaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house. \nSpeaker B: Understandable. Have you ever tried contacting animal control? That's how I got Bandicoot. I was working that day and animal control came by explaining about needing fosters for raccoons. I thought it was weird, so I did it and began to work at the small raccoon cafe that is part of the zoo. I love it. \nSpeaker A: That is a good idea.  Maybe they could help move them to a safer area.  I have a lot of traffic around and they could get hit if they are coming to my place all the time.  Have you been able to teach your raccoon any tricks? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A finds working in software solutions for tech companies less exciting than being a zoo keeper. Speaker A has not interacted closely with raccoons but admires them. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n\nSpeaker B works as a zoo keeper and enjoys it. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly. Speaker B's garbage has a lock to prevent animals from getting into it, especially during windy weather. Speaker B owns a raccoon named Bandicoot and a bearded dragon named Bob.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nSpeaker A is involved in software solutions for tech companies and often deals with the common IT troubleshooting phrase, \"did you try turning it on and off again?\" They have a passion for fostering dogs and hope to see more people adopting pets. Speaker A visited a pet store and expressed interest in a bearded dragon but had concerns due to fostering dogs. \n\nRelationship Description:\nSpeaker B, a zookeeper, shares a close bond with Speaker A, offering advice and insights on caring for animals. They discuss topics related to pets, such as the behavior of raccoons and the proper care of animals. Speaker B suggests solutions to Speaker A's pet-related issues, showing a caring and supportive relationship.\n\nEvent Description:\nEvents shared by Speaker A and Speaker B include discussions about their pets, such as Bandicoot, the bearded dragon, and the raccoon. They talk about the challenges of fostering dogs and the responsibilities of pet ownership. Speaker B provides tips on managing raccoon problems and ensures a safe environment for pets. The dialogue showcases a shared interest in animal welfare and a supportive dynamic between Speaker A and Speaker B.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains specific information about both speakers that directly pertains to the topic of raccoons and animal control, including Speaker B's experience as a zookeeper, their ownership of a raccoon named Bandicoot, and how they manage their garbage to prevent animal interference. This provides Speaker B with context on Speaker A's raccoon problem and their shared interest in raccoons, allowing Speaker B to offer relevant advice or share further experiences.\n\nMEMORY 2, while providing some relevant relationship context, is more generalized in nature and does not contain the focused details about the zookeeper role, specific raccoon experiences, or direct advice on managing a raccoon problem that MEMORY 1 does. \n\nChoice: 1"
