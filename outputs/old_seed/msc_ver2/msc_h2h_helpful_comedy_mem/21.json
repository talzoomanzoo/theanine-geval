    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me?\nSpeaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week?\nSpeaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day\nSpeaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through\nSpeaker A: Actually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to it. Do you think I will need to rent a car when I'm there, or is it possible to walk and bike in the summer? I always picture huge amounts of snow but I'm not sure if it's like that all year round.\nSpeaker A: I would definitely recommend looking for a rental car to have on hand. There is a town within walking distance from me, but it can be dangerous to walk with the wolves and elk around, especially at night. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A suggests going on hikes in Alaska to see wildlife and mentions glaciers as a potential attraction, which Speaker B is interested in during their visit. Speaker A also mentioned the wildlife, including elk and wolves, which Speaker B is interested in by asking about a wolf petting zoo.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nSpeaker A has blue eyes and blonde hair, prefers warmth, plans to retire down south on a beach, and enjoys eggs. Their favorite egg dish is egg benedict.\n\nRelationship Description:\nSpeaker A really likes their smart car, while Speaker B is a stereotypical old plumber who likes poached eggs. Speaker A suggested that Speaker B should seriously consider getting a smart car. They also discussed visiting Alaska and shared their excitement about the trip.\n\nEvent Description:\nSpeaker A had eggs for breakfast, thought of Speaker B when having eggs, and recommended looking into flights. They discussed airline fees, music festivals, and planned activities for the trip to Alaska, including petting wolves and going on a glacier tour. Speaker A and Speaker B are looking forward to spending time together and having a great experience.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides relevant information about wildlife and hiking in Alaska, which ties into the current conversation about transport and potentially encountering wildlife. It mentions both wolves and elk, which were mentioned as potential hazards in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, creating a relevant link that could guide Speaker B in their decision to rent a car. MEMORY 2, while containing some relevant trip planning information, is cluttered with unrelated personal descriptions and details that do not contribute helpfully to the immediate context about transportation and safety considerations concerning wildlife.\n\nChoice: 1"
