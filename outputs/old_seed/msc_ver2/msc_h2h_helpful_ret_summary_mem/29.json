    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go?\nSpeaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B is on their way to college and studying sports medicine, feeling overwhelmed by their mother's strictness and eager to finish school to escape it.\nSpeaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject, causing them to feel pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\nSpeaker B has been getting all A's in the sports medicine class, which changed Speaker A's struggle to maintain good grades as they find gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n2. Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring.\n3. Speaker B has been getting all A's in the sports medicine class.\n4. Speaker B is on their way to college and studying sports medicine.\n5. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n6. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The Dialogue Context reveals that Speaker A is asking about Speaker B's exams and then inquires specifically about Speaker A's history exam. Memory 1 contains detailed information about Speaker B's situation, which includes their academic pressures and relationship with their mother, but does not address Speaker A's history struggles directly. On the other hand, Memory 2 not only includes information about Speaker B's situation but also mentions Speaker A's difficulties in history, making it more relevant to the last utterance in the context. Therefore, Memory 2 is more helpful as it provides context for both parties, which is useful for a more relevant and supportive response from Speaker A.\n\nChoice: 2"
