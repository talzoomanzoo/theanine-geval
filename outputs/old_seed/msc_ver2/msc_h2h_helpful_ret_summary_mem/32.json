    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \nSpeaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with?\nSpeaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point.\nSpeaker A: Yes, it contains eggs.  I think you would do well with the fried rice. It's best to cook the rice the day before.   \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A enjoys cooking and baking, possibly considering turning it into a business. This is similar to Speaker B's husband, who is a great cook and enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work. Speaker B, on the other hand, is not skilled in cooking but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker. In addition, Speaker B also mentions having a farm with animals like chickens, ducks, pigs, goats, and growing crops like corn, strawberries, and pumpkins. This resonates with Speaker A, who owns a farm and enjoys cooking and baking. This has led Speaker A to become a cook and enjoy using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work.\n2. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker.\n3. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n4. Speaker A primarily cooks Indian food and bakes a lot of rice dishes.\n5. Speaker A recommends the pressure cooker for its efficiency and ease of use, suggesting it to Speaker B.\n6. Speaker A has given a pressure cooker as a gift and uses it for recipes like lamb shanks.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue is centered on cooking, specifically using a pressure cooker and making fried rice. MEMORY 1 provides context about Speaker B's interest in learning to cook with a pressure cooker and their farm life, which is relevant to the discussion about using home-grown eggs in the recipe. While MEMORY 2 also mentions cooking interests and details about pressure cooker usage, it does not directly connect to the current context of using eggs in the recipe as MEMORY 1 does with its mention of Speaker B's farm animals, specifically chickens, which aligns with the discussion of using eggs. \n\nChoice: 1"
