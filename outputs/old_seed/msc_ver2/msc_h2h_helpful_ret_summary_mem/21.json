    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me?\nSpeaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week?\nSpeaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day\nSpeaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through\nSpeaker A: Actually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to it. Do you think I will need to rent a car when I'm there, or is it possible to walk and bike in the summer? I always picture huge amounts of snow but I'm not sure if it's like that all year round.\nSpeaker A: I would definitely recommend looking for a rental car to have on hand. There is a town within walking distance from me, but it can be dangerous to walk with the wolves and elk around, especially at night. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A suggests going on hikes in Alaska to see wildlife and mentions glaciers as a potential attraction, which Speaker B is interested in during their visit. Speaker A also mentioned the wildlife, including elk and wolves, which Speaker B is interested in by asking about a wolf petting zoo.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B is planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n2. Speaker A suggests going on hikes in Alaska to see wildlife and mentions glaciers as a potential attraction.\n3. Speaker A plans to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit.\n4. Speaker A has invited Speaker B to visit them and is excited about the trip.\n5. Speaker A has visited Alaska and describes it as beautiful, suggesting cheap flights to Anchorage.\n6. Speaker A invited Speaker B to visit and mentioned looking into flights.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context indicates that Speaker B is contemplating a visit to Speaker A and discusses logistics and activities related to the visit. Memory 1 specifically mentions the local wildlife, such as wolves and elk, which ties directly to Speaker A's recent mention of these animals and the recommendation to rent a car due to their presence. This makes Memory 1 more relevant to the safety concerns and immediate travel advice given by Speaker A. Memory 2, while informative about general plans and interests, provides a broader context that isn't as directly linked to the specific concerns about local wildlife and transportation.\n\nChoice: 1"
