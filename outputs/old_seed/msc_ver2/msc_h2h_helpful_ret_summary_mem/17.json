Have you gone to your local zoo? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities. This is why Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys. In contrast, Speaker B's daughter likes monkeys and is starting to assert her independence. On a similar note, Speaker B is interested in finding family discounts for the zoo as well as pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1.

Speaker B is interested in finding family discounts for the zoo.\n6. Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 2 provides a more comprehensive set of relevant details that can be useful for Speaker B in responding to Speaker A. Specifically, it includes the information that Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys, which can naturally follow Speaker A's question about whether Speaker B has gone to the local zoo. Memory 2 also mentions that Speaker B is pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo, which is relevant and adds depth to the conversation. Memory 1 contains similar information but is less detailed and omits some specifics that could be relevant in the context.\n\nChoice: 2"
