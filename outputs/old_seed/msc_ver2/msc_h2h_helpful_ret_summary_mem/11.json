My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do.\nSpeaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see.

    "prediction": "Explanation: Both MEMORIES provide similar information about the Alaskan trip planning, potential activities, and the familiarity of Speaker A with Alaska. However, MEMORY 2 directly addresses the idea that Speaker A thinks of Alaska as cold and snowy and mentions the possibility of skiing, which can help Speaker B when considering various outdoor activities besides dog sledding or stargazing. This additional detail is more aligned with the current discussion in the dialogue, providing further relevant context. \n\nChoice: 2"
