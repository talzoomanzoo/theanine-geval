I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes.  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A's interest in animals, specifically raccoons and bearded dragons, was sparked by their work in software solutions for tech companies, which they find less exciting than being a zoo keeper. They are currently dealing with a raccoon problem and plan to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes. Additionally, Speaker B has been taking care of a raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n2. Speaker A hears raccoons and cats fighting in their neighborhood.\n3.
