This reminds Speaker A that they have a cousin in Sweden but have not visited the country yet. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip. Speaker B recommends checking out the volcanoes in Sweden for a unique experience.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n4. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n5. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B discussed the differences between Sweden and the US, including coffee breaks.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more helpful because it provides a broader context about the relationship between Speaker A and Speaker B concerning the trip to Sweden. It includes shared plans about traveling together, discussions about Sweden, and the challenges of visiting due to expenses, which can all serve as relevant topics or considerations in discussing Speaker A's trip planning progress. In contrast, MEMORY 1 provides less context about their mutual travel plans or in-depth discussions about Sweden, though it offers a unique travel recommendation that is less likely to be directly relevant at this stage of trip planning.\n\nChoice: 2"
