Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\nSpeaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\nSpeaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\nSpeaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.\nSpeaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe?\nSpeaker B: There is some weird chemical mix that I really do not mess with.  It is easy to clean up.  I try to stay away from this part of the movies.  I know what it should look like and that we want to keep everyone safe when using the fake blood. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B's father's involvement in producing horror movies influenced Speaker B's favorite genre, leading them to create horror movies with their dad and come up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\nSpeaker B's government job led them to mention taking a nap during work, while Speaker A's passion for producing horror movies makes them want to create movies with Speaker B.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Horror Movie Discussions', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B talk about horror movies, including preferences and recent releases.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: For sure.  Shows and movies are my favorite past time.  I love horror movies.  I think it's so cool you make horror movies with your dad.  How do you come up with the plot to your movies? ### Speaker B: We have a lot of weird, creative conversations. We always have in my family. We used to write parts of stories and then swap them half-way through so that the other person could take over the story and add different creative elements to it. That's honestly how we still come up with some of our ideas. ### Speaker A: That's terrific!  Have you seen any good horror movies recently?  Personally, I prefer the classics like Halloween or Friday the 13th. ### Speaker B: Yes, we watch a lot of horror movies in our family. Our favorite right now is the Conjuring series of films and their spin-offs. The newest one just came out and it was ok. Have you seen any horror movies lately? ### Speaker A: Yes, but just the classics like I mentioned.  I'm not too keen on the modern ones, they just don't make them like they used to.  Who knows, maybe one day I'll be watching your creation in the theatres.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time?
