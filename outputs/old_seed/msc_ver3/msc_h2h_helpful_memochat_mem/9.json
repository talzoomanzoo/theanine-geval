By the way do you get to eat for free at the restaurant you work at? ### Speaker A: We get two free meals per week and we can take home any left over baked goods at the end of the night so they don't go to waste.  It's a nice perk for sure. ### Speaker B: Wow… that’s awesome! I’ve always thought that’s a gr8 perk myself! ### Speaker A: Yeah, it's better than just a discount cause I shouldn't eat out too much since it's expensive and it saves me a little money on meals.
