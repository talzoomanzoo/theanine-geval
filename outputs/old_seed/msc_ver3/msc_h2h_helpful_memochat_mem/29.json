I want some suggestion from you.\nSpeaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them\nSpeaker A: IN MY HOME?! A TREE? That was not at all what I was thinking. Do they grow well indoors? I am intrigued. \nSpeaker B: Well if you want to make it like a proper garden experience then I would suggest going all in, and go for the best most authentic looking items you could get \nSpeaker A: Wow! Ok! This is sounding like a bigger undertaking! Should I embrace bugs in the home if they help the plants or am I getting wild?\nSpeaker B: Well from my experince bugs do the complete opposite and don't help at all, so avoid that at all costs! Fertilizers are the way to go to help with growth.\nSpeaker A: Oh man. I have lots to learn. What is the lifespan of a plum tree?\nSpeaker B: around 10 to 15 years but if you take care of them I'm sure you could get 20 out of it.\nSpeaker A: Now we are also talking commitment! This is not how I expected my day to go! I am excited, yet so nervous! \nSpeaker B: It doesn't take too much time to do per day so after school give it a little water and that should keep them in great way. Speaking off school how are you getting on?\nSpeaker A: Ok! I am putting my fate in your hands on this one. School is fine. I don't really pay attention to anything except band class. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden. - (Want) - Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Gardening and Survival in Space', 'Related Summaries': 'Discussion on gardening, plant survival in space, and the possibility of using weeds for space travel.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: What plants do you think would be able to survive a space trip best? ### Speaker B: Hmmm, maybe the weeds growing in my backyard, haha.

    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 provides relevant information about Speaker B's expertise in gardening, which is directly useful for the ongoing conversation about indoor gardening. It supports Speaker B's credibility and can guide Speaker A in trusting their gardening advice. On the other hand, Memory 2 focuses on gardening in the context of space survival, which is off-topic and does not add value to the current conversation about indoor gardening and plants that grow well in the home. \n\nChoice: 1"
