    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 focuses on Speaker B's experience as a motivational speaker and their personal experience overcoming struggles through motivational speaking and being in nature. This aligns with the current dialogue context where Speaker B offers to be the motivational speaker for Speaker A, as they mention tricks up their sleeve for motivating people who are resistant or lacking motivation. Hence, MEMORY 2 provides relevant background information that could be useful for Speaker A to understand and appreciate the context of Speaker B's offer. \n\nIn contrast, MEMORY 1 includes details about Speaker A's running goals and training which are not directly relevant to the immediate context where Speaker B's capability as a motivational speaker is the focus.\n\nChoice: 2"
