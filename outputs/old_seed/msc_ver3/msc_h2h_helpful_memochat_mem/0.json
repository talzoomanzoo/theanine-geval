Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\nSpeaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing? \nSpeaker B: He's doing well! He just finished theatre camp and he's fighting with my sister because he wants to dye his hair green hahaha.\nSpeaker A: Young people today really have different values than our generation had. Acting sounds like it would be personally rewarding. I also like the arts. I play guitar and piano. You mentioned that you have a poll. That sounds refreshing in the hot weather.\nSpeaker B: Yes it's great, but it hasn't stopped raining here! How's the weather where you are? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation.\nSpeaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\nSpeaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break, and wants to go on a trip but has not started packing yet.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Family growth', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A reflects on how her youngest grandchild is growing up fast, now at 14 years old.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: She's 14, so still has a few years to go.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The task requires choosing which MEMORY provides Speaker A with more helpful context to respond meaningfully to Speaker B's remark about the rain and the weather. MEMORY 1 mentions Speaker B's plans and excitement for Easter and spring break, while MEMORY 2 involves family growth discussions about Speaker A's youngest grandchild. Between the two, neither MEMORY directly addresses weather-related topics or provides specific insights on rain or weather. However, MEMORY 1's hint about upcoming travel plans suggesting possible anticipation for better weather is slightly more contextually relevant compared to MEMORY 2's focus on family growth, which is unrelated to the topic at hand.\n\nChoice: 1"
