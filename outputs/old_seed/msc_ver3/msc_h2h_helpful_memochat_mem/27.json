    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides information about Speaker A's brother being a fan of Brazilian food, which is directly relevant to the conversation about what foods were eaten while watching the Black Widow movie. This information is useful because it directly addresses Speaker B's question about the foods enjoyed during the movie. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, offers context about general family activities and previous mentions of the Black Widow movie, which is less useful in directly answering Speaker B's specific question about food.\n\nChoice: 1"
