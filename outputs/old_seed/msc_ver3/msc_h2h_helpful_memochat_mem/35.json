It's so good! I'm not a very good cook but I do know how to make jello! ### Speaker B: Well that's a good start I guess! Did you grandma teach you how to make it? ### Speaker A: Yeah she did teach me! It's become a family tradition! ### Speaker B: That's so sweet! I wish I had the opportunity to spend that kind of quality time with my grandparents. ### Speaker A: It is very nice! Why don't you have the time? ### Speaker B: They were always pretty busy running their grocery store and I never really got much of a chance to spend that kind of time with them before they died, unfortunately. ### Speaker A: My grandma just taught me an even better cherry jello recipe than the one she taught me before.  ### Speaker B: Nice! How did it turn out? ### Speaker A: Not too bad but still needs some work! ### Speaker B: I am sure the more you make it the better it will get.

    "prediction": "Explanation: \nIn the dialogue context, Speaker B is talking about water skiing, boating, and witnessing a drone that can pull a person in the water. This points to a conversation more centered around activities involving water sports rather than family traditions and jello recipes. Memory 1 includes information relevant to water skiing and boating, indicating that Speaker B is excited about buying a new car and wants to try water skiing next, which aligns with the current conversation. Memory 2, on the other hand, delves into family traditions, jello recipes, and spending time with grandparents, which does not relate to the current water sports discussion taking place in the dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 1"
