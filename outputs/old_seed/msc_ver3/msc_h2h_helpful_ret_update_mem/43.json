    "prediction": "Explanation: The focus of the dialogue context is around the idea of winning the lotto and potentially moving due to financial changes, with Speaker A expressing difficulty with the expense of an iPhone and considering city vs. country living after winning the lotto. MEMORY 2 provides relevant information on the lotto strategies, which is what they were previously discussing, and gives context on the number of tickets each speaker bought, enhancing Speaker B's opportunity to respond to the question about city living. Additionally, MEMORY 2 brings in Speaker B's interest in both city and country living, which directly relates to the last question from Speaker A. MEMORY 1 contains some repetitive information and additional background about Speaker A's upbringing, which is less relevant to the current context. \n\nChoice: 2"
