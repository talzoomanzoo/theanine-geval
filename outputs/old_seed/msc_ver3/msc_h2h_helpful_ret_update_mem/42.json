    "prediction": "Explanation: In the dialogue context, Speaker A is engaging with Speaker B about being motivated to run despite the hot weather. Memory 2 is helpful as it provides relevant information about Speaker B's profession as a motivational speaker and highlights their interest in running marathons, which directly ties into the current conversation. It also notes Speaker B's personal experience with motivation, making their role as a motivator more authentic and relatable. This context allows Speaker A to trust Speaker B's motivational abilities, potentially commenting on Speaker B's own challenges with motivation. Memory 1 includes details that are less directly related to the immediate dialogue and focuses more on other aspects like Speaker A's dislike of travel and humorous unrelated activities.\n\nChoice: 2"
