    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides specific information about Speaker A's current job status, their interest in computers, and their considerations for future career changes. This is directly relevant to the question about their current job at a computer company. MEMORY 1, while containing similar information, includes less specific context about Speaker A's interest in programming or building computers and their potential career moves. Therefore, MEMORY 2 offers more detailed insight that would help Speaker B respond better in the context of their question.\n\nChoice: 2"
