Do you miss it?\nSpeaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \nSpeaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living.\nSpeaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime?\nSpeaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with.\nSpeaker A: Sounds great! Now the tough question: when do you have time?\nSpeaker B: It would have to be sometime when I'm off work, maybe on the weekend. \nSpeaker A: OK. Just let me know when you want to plan it and I will put in the reservation request. Do you need to borrow cleats or anything? I am a size 11.5. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket, but now plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.

    "prediction": "Explanation: Speaker B may appreciate knowing about Speaker A's soccer experience, which is relevant given their interest in soccer. Speaker B's interest in Manchester United could be a relevant point of connection as well. Both memories provide information about Speaker B's soccer experience, but Memory 2 adds additional relevant information about Speaker A's soccer fandom (being a fan of Arsenal and watching international teams), which could be interesting for Speaker B. Additionally, the mention of Speaker A's recent scoring performance may show their current involvement and success in the sport, which is related to planning informal soccer games.\n\nChoice: 2"
