    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides specific insights into Speaker A's habits of visiting the zoo often and enjoying certain animals, along with mentioning Speaker B's daughter. This memory connects directly to Speaker B's question about going to the zoo, and also mentions Speaker A's weekly visits, making it highly relevant to the dialogue context. On the other hand, MEMORY 2, while it provides background information on both speakers and their mutual interests, is less directly tied to the zoo question at hand and is more general.\n\nChoice: 1"
