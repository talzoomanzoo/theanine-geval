    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships!\nSpeaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!   I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field?\nSpeaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate?\nSpeaker B: I have another year- so this year is really important I get internships and start making connections in the field.   I love going to the beach too.  What happened with your knees that now cause you so much pain?\nSpeaker A: I think age has really been my knees downfall. I also used to hike a lot and I put a lot of pressure on my legs. That is great that you only have a year. Maybe when you graduate you can come hang out on the beach with me. I can't surf but I would love to watch you.\nSpeaker B: That would be fun!  I like collecting shells too so we could do that as well.  I have a small collection of ones I have from around the world.

Where have you been in Europe?\nSpeaker A: Oh gosh. I have been to France, England, Ireland, Switzerland, Austria, Poland, Germany, Leichenstein, Spain, and much of Mexico, and Bermuda. I just love to travel but I have not been able to recently and with my knees I cannot sit in coach anymore and first class is so expensive. Do you plan on settling any place in particular once you graduate?  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A mentions their neighbor John who loves soccer, which causes Speaker B to be studying sports medicine and playing soccer, looking to join their college team in the future. This leads Speaker B's professors to be supportive in writing letters for an internship application, prompting Speaker A to offer advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field.\nSpeaker B's mother running a local high school, with Speaker B being her only child, leads to Speaker B being interested in sports medicine and enjoying surfing.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nSpeaker A is a retired individual who spends most days hiking along the coast. They are not interested in voting but appreciate equality.

Speaker B shared about their hope for the job market to pick up soon and their efforts to secure internships in the sports medicine field, including seeking recommendations from professors.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses on a discussion about traveling and also touches on Speaker B's field of study (sports medicine) and their need to secure internships. In this context, it would be more useful to have memory related to Speaker B's field, their need for internships, and their relationship with Speaker A. MEMORY 1 provides a direct linkage to Speaker B's interest in sports medicine and the internship application process, which aligns well with the context of seeking internships in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Meanwhile, MEMORY 2 primarily describes Speaker A's interests in hiking and surfing, which is less relevant to the current discussion in the dialogue, which has shifted focus to travel and career progression. Therefore, MEMORY 1 is more helpful as it provides background on Speaker B's focus on sports medicine and their need for internships.\n\nChoice: 1"
