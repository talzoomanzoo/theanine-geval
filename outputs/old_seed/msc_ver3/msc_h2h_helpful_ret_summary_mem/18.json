    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college?\nSpeaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position. \nSpeaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it?\nSpeaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \nSpeaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living.\nSpeaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime?\nSpeaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with.\nSpeaker A: Sounds great! Now the tough question: when do you have time?\nSpeaker B: It would have to be sometime when I'm off work, maybe on the weekend. \nSpeaker A: OK. Just let me know when you want to plan it and I will put in the reservation request. Do you need to borrow cleats or anything? I am a size 11.5. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket, but now plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week. Additionally, Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments. \nSpeaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United. \nSpeaker A enjoys playing soccer and is studying Humanities in college with the goal of finishing before looking for a job. They are seeking career advice from a guidance counselor and considering options in humanities or teaching.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n2. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.\n3. Speaker A enjoys playing soccer but is not into music.\n4. Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n5. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n6. Speaker A plans to meet up with Speaker B to discuss career prospects and borrow college books.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context revolves around Speaker B's interest in soccer and considering playing soccer casually with Speaker A. Thus, the memory that provides relevant and useful information about soccer and Speaker A's involvement would be more helpful for Speaker B to form a response. \n\nMemory 1 mentions more specific details about Speaker A's involvement in soccer, participating in tournaments, and their college studies, which could be relevant to the conversation about playing soccer casually and arranging a meeting to play or discuss interests. Meanwhile, Memory 2 offers similar but slightly less detailed information, focusing more on scoring and soccer performance. Both memories touch on other potentially irrelevant topics (like Speaker A's disinterest in music or Speaker B's fandom) but do not differ significantly.\n\nGiven that both memories offer similar levels of relevance, it becomes a close call regarding which is more helpful.\n\nChoice: tie"
