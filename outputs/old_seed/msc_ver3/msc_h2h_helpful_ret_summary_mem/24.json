    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\nSpeaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\nSpeaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\nSpeaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.\nSpeaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe?\nSpeaker B: There is some weird chemical mix that I really do not mess with.  It is easy to clean up.  I try to stay away from this part of the movies.  I know what it should look like and that we want to keep everyone safe when using the fake blood. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B's father's involvement in producing horror movies influenced Speaker B's favorite genre, leading them to create horror movies with their dad and come up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\nSpeaker B's government job led them to mention taking a nap during work, while Speaker A's passion for producing horror movies makes them want to create movies with Speaker B.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\n2. Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them.\n3. Speaker B's father was involved in producing horror movies, which influenced Speaker B's favorite genre.\n4. Speaker A prefers classic horror movies like Halloween or Friday the 13th over modern ones.\n5. Speaker A also likes mid-century design and is a fan of horror movies.\n6. Speaker B's dad works on smaller projects and has never been involved in a major Hollywood film.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 both provide relevant information about Speaker B's and Speaker A's interest and involvement in horror movies. The important detail that can be derived is Speaker B's background in horror movie production with their father, which is a central theme in both memories. However, MEMORY 2 provides additional information about Speaker A's preferences for classic horror movies and their interest in mid-century design, which could be relevant given Speaker A's line of questioning about Speaker B's creative pursuits.\n\nChoice: 2"
