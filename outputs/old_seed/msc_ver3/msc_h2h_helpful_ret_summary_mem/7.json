How are the little furries doing?\nSpeaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from?\nSpeaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1.

Speaker B is currently working on a portrait for Speaker A and also working on other portraits while taking care of a sick dog.\n\n2.

Speaker B also likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions. Speaker A is considering getting kittens and thinks rats can be smart.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1.

Speaker A prefers adopting pets from shelters rather than from breeders.\n6. Speaker A is getting their portrait painted by Speaker B.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more helpful because it contains relevant information about Speaker B's interest in painting pets, which aligns with Speaker B's current plan to paint their pets together. It also mentions Speaker A's preference for adopting from shelters, which directly ties to their plan of getting a new cat from a shelter, as discussed in the dialogue context. On the other hand, MEMORY 1 includes a lot of extraneous information about Speaker B's previous projects and pricing, which is not particularly relevant to the ongoing conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
