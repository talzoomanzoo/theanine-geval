    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context has Speaker B asking whether Speaker A went to the zoo last weekend, indicating an interest in zoo-related activities. Memory 1 mentions that Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and goes there weekly, which directly relates to the conversation. It also notes that Speaker B's daughter likes monkeys, which could be a topic of interest if the discussion continues about what they saw at the zoo. Memory 2 provides more details, including Speaker B's interest in family discounts for the zoo and their child's specific desire to see monkeys, which could lead to a more enriched discussion about zoo visits as a family activity and possibly tying it to camping trips. Thus, Memory 2 provides a broader range of relevant details that can make the conversation more engaging.\n\nChoice: 2"
