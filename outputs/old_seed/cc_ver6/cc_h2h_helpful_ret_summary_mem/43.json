I thought we were happy together.\nNeighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left?\nNeighbors A: No, I haven't. I don't even know what I would say to him. I feel like I'm not enough, like I wasn't good enough for him.\nNeighbors B: That's not true, Neighbor A. You are an amazing person and you deserve someone who appreciates you for who you are.\nNeighbors A: I just feel so lost right now. I don't know how to move on from this. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbors A wanted to improve their quality of life by moving out of a run-down apartment complex.

Neighbor A appreciates the emotional support and understanding from Neighbor B during their time of grief.\n2. Neighbor A is grieving the recent loss of their grandmother.\n3. Neighbor B is offering support and companionship to Neighbor A during their difficult time.\n4. Neighbor A recently moved to a new neighborhood and feels safer and happier there.\n5. Neighbor A finds solace in nature and believes that it helps in coping with their emotions.\n6.

    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories provide useful context about Neighbor A's current emotional state and their relationship with Neighbor B. However, Memory 2 is more directly relevant to the dialogue context because it focuses specifically on the emotional support and companionship that Neighbor B is providing to Neighbor A during a difficult time. Memory 2 also highlights Neighbor A's recent loss, their appreciation of Neighbor B's support, and the positive impact of their friendship, which is central to the ongoing conversation about moving on and finding solace.\n\nChoice: 2"
