    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is about Co-worker A reflecting on an emotional experience they had while working on a movie and how Co-worker B's support helped them. Memory 1 provides more specific information that relates directly to the context, particularly the part about Co-worker A feeling remorse, appreciating Co-worker B's understanding, and learning about empathy and compassion. This allows Co-worker B to respond in a way that acknowledges and builds on these reflections. Memory 2, while providing a broad context about their collaboration and friendship, lacks the specific emotional details and learning experiences mentioned in Memory 1.\n\nChoice: 1"
