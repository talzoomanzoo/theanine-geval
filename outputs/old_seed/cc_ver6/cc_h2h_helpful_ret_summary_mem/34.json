    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Mentor to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, have you ever tried to imagine what it would be like to think like someone else?\nMentor: Yes, I have. It's a great way to better understand and empathize with others.\nMentee: That's exactly what I thought. I've been trying to imagine what personY is thinking lately. It's been helping me to understand their perspective a bit better.\nMentor: That's a great approach. Putting ourselves in someone else's shoes can help us see things from a different angle and see where they're coming from.\nMentee: Exactly. And it also helps me to be more compassionate towards them. I think it's important for us to be more understanding and supportive of each other, especially in difficult times. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Mentee is taking the idea of teaching religion seriously and wants to make a positive impact on people's lives. This approach helps Mentee to be more compassionate and understanding towards others, especially in difficult times.\n2. Mentee is currently living in an abusive and controlling cult. Mentor suggests Mentee volunteer at a local church or religious organization to gain experience, aiming to make a positive impact and be supportive of others. This is why Mentor became a mentor, to help those in similar situations.\n3. Mentee is currently living in an abusive and controlling cult. Mentee agrees to teach in a way that allows people to make their own decisions about their beliefs, influenced by Mentor's advice and support.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Mentee wants to make a positive impact in people's lives and is grateful for Mentor's support.\n2. Mentor became a mentor to help others going through similar situations.\n3. Mentee agrees to try the advice and express gratitude towards Mentor.\n4. Mentor encourages Mentee to approach teaching religion with an open mind and heart.\n5. Mentee has been thinking about helping others who may be in abusive cults.\n6. Mentee is taking the idea of teaching religion seriously and wants to make a positive impact on people's lives.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue focuses on Mentee's understanding and empathy development by imagining another person's perspective. MEMORY 1, while containing very specific and related context about compassion and understanding, is clouded by additional context about Mentee living in a controlling cult, which might not be relevant to Mentee's current focus in the dialogue. MEMORY 2 contains a broader range of supportive memories and emphasizes the Mentor's role in fostering understanding and making a positive impact, which directly ties into the Mentee's current focus in the dialogue. It also notes Mentee's gratitude, reinforcing a positive mentor-mentee dynamic. Thus, MEMORY 2 offers more contextually relevant and supportive insights for the conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
