To respond appropriately, the relevant memory should focus on experiences or characteristics of Classmates A and B that align with enjoying or exploring nature, camping activities, or related interests. Neither memory seems directly related to the context of camping, but Memory 2 contains less extraneous information about allergies and is more straightforward in presenting Classmates B's admiration for Classmates A's community involvement and proactive behavior. This could hint at Classmate A's potential interest in activities like camping as a form of community appreciation or environmental awareness.\n\nChoice: 2"
