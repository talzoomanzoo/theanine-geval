This led to Classmates B praising Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.\n\n2. Classmates A and B have been on field trips to other planets or moons before, like Mars, leading to Classmate B admiring Classmate A's attitude as a good example for others.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is focused on Classmate B feeling embarrassed and not wanting to share the details. Therefore, helpful memories would be those that relate to emotional support, understanding, or handling embarrassing or difficult situations. MEMORY 2 provides relevant emotional context such as Classmates A expressing gratitude for support, Classmate B admiring Classmate A's attitude, and the idea of helping each other out of friendship. These elements can help Classmates B feel more comfortable sharing their embarrassing moment by emphasizing a supportive relationship dynamic. MEMORY 1, while providing details of specific past actions like spaceship repairs, focuses more on the resilience aspect which is less relevant to the current embarrassing situation.\n\nChoice: 2"
