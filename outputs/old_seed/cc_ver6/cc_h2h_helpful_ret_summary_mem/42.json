    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just can't believe he left me like that. I thought we were happy together.\nNeighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left?\nNeighbors A: No, I haven't. I don't even know what I would say to him. I feel like I'm not enough, like I wasn't good enough for him.\nNeighbors B: That's not true, Neighbor A. You are an amazing person and you deserve someone who appreciates you for who you are. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbor A recently moved into the neighborhood and wanted to live in a nicer area, which is why they have a bit of a drive to get to the park where they meet with Neighbor B. This change led to both of them enjoying going for walks together, especially to the park. As a result, Neighbor B is offering support and companionship to Neighbor A during their difficult time. \n\nNeighbor A was tired of living in a run-down apartment complex and wanted to improve their quality of life, which caused them and Neighbor B to become neighbors who catch up outside of their neighborhood. This connection led to both of them enjoying going for walks together, especially to the park, and developing a close friendship where they have shared memories of spending time together in the park.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbor A appreciates the emotional support and understanding from Neighbor B during their time of grief.\n2. Neighbor B is offering support and companionship to Neighbor A during their difficult time.\n3. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have a close friendship and have shared memories of spending time together in the park.\n4. Neighbor A recently moved to a new neighborhood and feels safer and happier there.\n5. Neighbor A is grieving the recent loss of their grandmother.\n6. Neighbor A finds solace in nature and believes that it helps in coping with their emotions.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: In the dialogue context, Neighbor A is going through a breakup and feeling inadequate. Thus, emotional support and understanding from Neighbor B is most relevant. Memory 2 directly mentions that Neighbor A appreciates emotional support from Neighbor B, who is offering companionship during this tough time. It also mentions Neighbor A's grief over the loss of their grandmother, which may add context to their emotional state. Memory 1, while providing some context about their living situation and walks in the park, lacks specific emotional context that's directly tied to the immediate situation. Therefore, Memory 2 is more helpful for the current conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
