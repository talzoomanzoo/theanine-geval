    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context mentions the Mentor helping the Mentee by finding their glasses, which is a simple instance of support. Both memories highlight the supportive relationship between the Mentor and Mentee, especially in the context of the Mentee's journey to sobriety. However, Memory 2 presents this information in a straightforward list format, making it easier to extract specific points of ongoing support and positive reinforcement, which aligns with the current expression of gratitude in the conversation. Memory 1 provides similar information but wraps it in more context that may not be directly relevant to the specific instance of misplacing glasses.\n\nChoice: 2"
