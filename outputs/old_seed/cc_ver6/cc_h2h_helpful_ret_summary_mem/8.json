    "prediction": "Explanation: In the dialogue context, the mentee is expressing gratitude to the mentor for their support in their journey of sobriety and acknowledges the mentor's guidance as invaluable. The focus here is on the mentor's support and the mentee's achievements in sobriety. Both memories provide similar information; however, MEMORY 2 provides a slightly more comprehensive view, particularly through point 5, highlighting the mentor's acknowledgment of the mentee's achievements and continued supportâ€”an aspect that could be useful in reinforcing the mentor's role in the conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
