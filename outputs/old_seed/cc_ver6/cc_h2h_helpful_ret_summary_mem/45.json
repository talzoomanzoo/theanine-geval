It's perfect! \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- Classmate B previously discussed allergies with Classmate A a few years ago, which caused them to attend a party together.\n- Classmate A, actively involved in an action committee focused on improving the community, expresses a desire to find alternative ways to have fun and make a positive impact in the community.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides context about Classmate A and B forming a pact to keep a party secret, which adds relevance to the present discussion about a new camping spot, especially if it pertains to evading discovery or needing secrecy. This detail is directly related to the situation where Classmates A wanted to ensure a party wouldn't get discovered, thus lending relevance to the current scenario about camping. On the other hand, MEMORY 1 mostly focuses on community involvement, which may not be immediately relevant to camping or the concerns about being discovered in that context.\n\nChoice: 2"
