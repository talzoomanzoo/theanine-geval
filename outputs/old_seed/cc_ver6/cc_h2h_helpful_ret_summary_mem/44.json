I thought we were happy together.\nNeighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left?\nNeighbors A: No, I haven't. I don't even know what I would say to him. I feel like I'm not enough, like I wasn't good enough for him.\nNeighbors B: That's not true, Neighbor A. You are an amazing person and you deserve someone who appreciates you for who you are.\nNeighbors A: I just feel so lost right now. I don't know how to move on from this.\nNeighbors B: It's going to take time, but you will get through this. Do you want to talk about how you're feeling or do something to take your mind off of things?\nNeighbors A: Maybe both? I just feel so overwhelmed and I don't know what to do.\nNeighbors B: How about we go for a walk and you can talk to me about everything that's been on your mind?\nNeighbors A: That sounds good. You've always been such a good listener, Neighbor B. Thank you for being there for me. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- Neighbor A and Neighbor B share a close bond and often spend time together outside of their neighborhood, especially going for walks to the park.\n- Neighbor A values the emotional support and understanding provided by Neighbor B during times of grief.\n- Neighbor A and Neighbor B like to grab a meal together after their activities, creating a sense of companionship.\n- Neighbor B used to mention the neighborhood's affluence, but now finds peace in taking walks in the park to clear their mind.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbor A appreciates the emotional support and understanding from Neighbor B during their time of grief.\n2. Neighbor B is offering support and companionship to Neighbor A during their difficult time.\n3. Neighbor A finds solace in nature and believes that it helps in coping with their emotions.\n4. Neighbors A and Neighbors B enjoy going for walks together, especially to the park.\n5. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have a close friendship and have shared memories of spending time together in the park.\n6. Neighbor A is grieving the recent loss of their grandmother.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories emphasize the emotional support and companionship between Neighbor A and Neighbor B, as well as their shared enjoyment of walks to the park. However, Memory 2 is more helpful because it directly relates to Neighbor A's current state of grief and mentions their loss of their grandmother, which aligns with the context of them feeling overwhelmed and needing support. This particular detail could potentially inform Neighbor B's approach to comfort Neighbor A. \n\nChoice: 2"
