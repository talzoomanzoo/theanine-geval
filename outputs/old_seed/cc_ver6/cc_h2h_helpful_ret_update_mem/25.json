    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Co-workers B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message.\nCo-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of skills, you always present a compelling argument in debates. I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive.\nCo-workers A: Yes, I think it's important to back up your claims with facts and figures. It helps to convince the judge or the audience that you're right.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of convincing people, have you ever been in a physical altercation before?\nCo-workers A: Yes, unfortunately. But that doesn't mean I'm a danger to people. I just don't back down from a fight when I'm standing up for what's right. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nCo-worker A believes their evidence is more compelling than the opposing side's evidence. This leads Co-worker B to commend Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs. Co-worker B is happy with the house built by Co-worker A and is considering adding a deck to the house.\n\nCo-worker A plans to present the evidence clearly and persuasively in court, which has led to Co-worker A presenting evidence in front of a judge to support their position in the past. This, in turn, causes Co-worker A to deny that their reputation had any impact on Karen giving them the money.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker B commends Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs.\n2. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument.\n3. Co-worker A has experience dealing with challenging clients and emphasizes the importance of communication and setting expectations.\n4. Co-worker A's evidence includes statistics and personal accounts from clients.\n5. Co-worker A believes their evidence is more compelling than the opposing side's evidence.\n6. Co-worker A is perceived as dangerous by others due to their behavior in conflicts.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Based on the dialogue context, Co-worker B has transitioned the conversation from public speaking to Co-worker A's experiences with debates and courtroom presentations. They further inquire about Co-worker A's experiences with physical altercations, and Co-worker A clarifies their stance on standing up for their beliefs. MEMORY 2 contains useful information about Co-worker A's confidence in their arguments, experience with challenging situations, and others' perceptions of their behavior, which aligns with the topics of debate, courtroom evidence, and conflict resolution discussed. This information provides context for Co-worker B's inquiry and can guide their response appropriately. Conversely, MEMORY 1 contains less relevant details, such as the house and deck addition, or connection to Karen, which do not enhance the understanding of the dialogue or inform the current topic of discussion.\n\nChoice: 2"
