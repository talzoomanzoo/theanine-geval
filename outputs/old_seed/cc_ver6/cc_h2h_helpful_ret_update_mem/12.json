I've put a lot of effort into creating some eye-catching ads.\nChild: That sounds cool, but why do you want to make money from ads?\nParent: Well, I want to have some extra income coming in. Plus, I enjoy being creative and making things, so this is a great way for me to combine those passions.\nChild: I see. Well, I hope it works out for you, Parent.\nParent: Thanks, Child.

This makes MEMORY 2 more pertinent and helpful for the Child to use in the current conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
