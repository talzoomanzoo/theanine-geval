    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 contains more relevant information directly related to Classmates A's competitive nature and determination, which is useful in understanding why Classmates A might be focusing on studying algebraâ€”to challenge themselves and improve their skills. While MEMORY 1 provides some context about Classmates A's competitiveness, it mainly mentions struggles with the need to be the best, without offering as clear a picture of the competitive actions (such as competing in a race) that MEMORY 2 provides.\n\nChoice: 2"
