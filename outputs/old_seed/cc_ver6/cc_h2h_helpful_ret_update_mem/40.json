Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking?\nCo-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for asking me to join you.\nCo-workers A: No problem, it'll be great to catch up. Hey, do you remember when we talked about me being irresponsible a few years ago?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, I remember that conversation. What about it? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nCo-worker A has made mistakes in the past but is trying to be more aware of their actions. This leads to Co-worker B moving on from their arrest and appreciating Co-worker A's concern and change in behavior, reminding Co-worker A of their progress and potential for success. \nCo-worker A feels remorseful about the situation that led to Co-worker B's arrest, and as a result, Co-worker B has moved on and appreciates Co-worker A's concern and change in behavior, being supportive and encouraging towards Co-worker A. \nCo-worker B has been arrested in the past partly because of Co-worker A's actions, which is in the same topic as Co-workers A and B working together on a big story in the past, causing Co-worker A to be a journalist and a finalist in a singing competition.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-workers A and B have worked together on a big story in the past.\n2. Co-worker B points out that Co-worker A doesn't always consider how their actions can affect others.\n3. Co-worker B reassures Co-worker A and encourages them to have more confidence.\n4. Co-worker B is supportive and encouraging towards Co-worker A.\n5. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B acknowledge the importance of taking responsibility for their actions and learning from mistakes.\n6. Co-worker B has been arrested in the past partly because of Co-worker A's actions.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The last line of the dialogue context involves Co-workers A and B discussing a past conversation about Co-worker A being irresponsible. Given this context, Memory 2 is more helpful as it directly mentions that Co-worker B points out that Co-worker A doesn't always consider how their actions can affect others, and it also mentions both co-workers acknowledging the importance of taking responsibility. This provides relevant background to the current discussion about past irresponsibility and allows Co-worker A to respond in a way that aligns with Co-worker B's previous feedback.\n\nChoice: 2"
