I helped out a neighbor in need over the weekend.\nClassmates B: That's really kind of you. What did you do to help?\nClassmates A: She was moving and needed some extra hands to pack up her things and load them onto a truck. So I spent most of the day helping her out.\nClassmates B: Wow, that's really generous of you. I'm sure your neighbor really appreciated it.\nClassmates A: I hope so. I just felt like it was the right thing to do. I know if I were in that situation, I would appreciate any help I could get.\nClassmates B: Absolutely. It's important to be there for each other, especially in tough times.\nClassmates A: Yes, and it feels good to make a difference in someone's life, even if it's just in a small way. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nClassmates B's responsible handling of a previous class schedule mix-up led to them being supportive and helpful to Classmates A. Classmates B's advice to drive safely was well-received by Classmates A. \nClassmates B's thorough double-checking to prevent future issues made Classmates A concerned about their drinking habits and health. Despite initial worries, Classmates B values Classmates A's opinions. \nThe mutual appreciation between Classmates A and B has sparked plans to hang out outside of school.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Classmates A appreciates Classmates B's efforts and support.\n2. Classmates A appreciates the support and friendship of Classmates B.\n3. Classmates B handled a previous mix-up with the class schedule well, showing responsibility and reliability.\n4. Classmates A and B value their friendship and feel comfortable talking to each other about anything.\n5. Classmates A and B started as acquaintances and have developed a strong friendship.\n6. Classmates B was initially worried about Classmates A going out with friends but they value each other's opinions.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The criteria for choosing the most helpful MEMORY is its relevance and usefulness to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. In this context, Classmates A is talking about helping a neighbor and the importance of making a difference in someone's life. Classmates B's response should ideally relate to support, kindness, or friendship. \n\nMEMORY 1 contains information about a previous supportive interaction and plans to hang out, which aligns with the themes of support and doing good for others discussed in the conversation. \n\nMEMORY 2, while also mentioning appreciation and friendship, is more general and less directly related to an instance of charitable or supportive action, as highlighted in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nGiven this analysis, MEMORY 1 is slightly more relevant because it suggests a supportive dynamic in a specific instance, which could lead to a more contextually appropriate response.\n\nChoice: 1"
