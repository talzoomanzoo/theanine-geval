Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke.

It was so warm that day.\nNeighbors B: Yeah, that was a hot day. I'm glad you felt comfortable in my home though.\nNeighbors A: You know, I really enjoy spending time with you. I want to get to know you even better.\nNeighbors B: I feel the same way. We should plan something fun to do together.\nNeighbors A: Absolutely.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue ends with Neighbors A discussing a disagreement about ripping a tag off a shirt, and asking Neighbors B if they ever have similar disagreements with their parents. MEMORY 1 highlights the fact that Neighbors A and B enjoy spending time together and have a history of reminiscing about past events, which relates to the playful tone and shared history shown in the context. Meanwhile, MEMORY 2 mostly focuses on themes related to outdoor activities, lawn mowing, and dealing with temperature, which are not directly relevant to the question about parental disagreements. Thus, MEMORY 1 is more useful and relevant to responding in the context of the last utterance.\n\nChoice: 1"
