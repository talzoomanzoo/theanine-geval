    "prediction": "Explanation: When evaluating the helpfulness of the two memories, we should consider which memory provides context that would allow Co-worker B to respond effectively to the ongoing dialogue. The dialogue focuses on a variety of topics, including speaking skills, carpentry skills, and instances of standing up for one's beliefs. Memory 1 highlights Co-worker A's craftsmanship and hints at Co-worker B's satisfaction with a project and future plans, while Memory 2 presents more information about Co-worker A's professional skills, such as collecting evidence and dealing with clients, but this information isn't directly relevant to the current conversation. Memory 1 would enable Co-worker B to continue the conversation seamlessly, possibly by discussing the shared satisfaction with the house or follow-up projects.\n\nChoice: 1"
