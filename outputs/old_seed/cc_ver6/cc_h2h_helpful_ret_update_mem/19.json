I sang a solo at church this past weekend!\nCo-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while.\nCo-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides more detailed information relevant to the current dialogue, particularly about Co-worker A's observant nature and their interest in solving puzzles and mysteries, which was discussed in the dialogue. Additionally, it mentions Co-worker B's marital status and social activities, which ties into the conversation about surprises. These details can help Co-worker B respond thoughtfully to the last utterance about Ms. Singh and shared memories. On the other hand, MEMORY 1 is less detailed and combines unrelated details about future plans and skills.\n\nChoice: 2"
