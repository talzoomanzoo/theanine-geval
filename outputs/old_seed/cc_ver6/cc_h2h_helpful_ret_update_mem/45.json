It's perfect! \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- Classmate B previously discussed allergies with Classmate A a few years ago, which caused them to attend a party together.\n- Classmate A, actively involved in an action committee focused on improving the community, expresses a desire to find alternative ways to have fun and make a positive impact in the community.

Classmates A is proactive and curious, taking the initiative to research topics of interest.\n6. Classmate A agrees to take better care of themselves in the future.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context involves Classmate A showing Classmate B a camping spot they found. The most relevant information would involve shared interests in outdoor activities, camping, or exploring. MEMORY 1 discusses Classmate A's involvement in community improvement and Classmate B's admiration for it, which is somewhat related if Classmate A sees camping as a positive community activity. MEMORY 2 contains similar information but adds concerns about getting in trouble at a party, which does not relate to the current discussion about camping. Both memories offer context about Classmate A's character and interests, but neither directly addresses camping or outdoor activities, which would be most helpful.\n\nChoice: Tie"
