    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 2 directly references the past event of Neighbors A pushing Neighbors B's shoulder, which was mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as a stressful time that they have moved past. This makes Memory 2 more relevant and likely to help Neighbors B respond appropriately to the last utterance of the dialogue. Memory 1, while offering a positive sentiment about their relationship, does not directly relate to the specific past event or the stress management topic discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nChoice: 2"
