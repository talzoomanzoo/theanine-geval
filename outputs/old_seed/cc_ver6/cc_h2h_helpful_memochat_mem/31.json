    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context deals with Classmates B feeling embarrassed and being encouraged by Classmates A to share what happened. Memory 1 provides various instances of Classmate A and B's past interactions, but none directly relate to embarrassment or revealing personal stories. On the other hand, Memory 2 includes a section where Classmates B acknowledges Classmate A's courage in a difficult situation, potentially encouraging open sharing. This could be used by Classmate A to persuade Classmate B by referencing resilience in difficult situations, which could make B more comfortable in sharing their embarrassing incident.\n\nChoice: 2"
