    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 contains information directly relevant to the current discussion topic about Ms. Singh leaving and Co-worker B being married. It provides background and additional context for both topics mentioned in the recent dialogue. This will enable Co-worker B to respond knowledgeably about past discussions related to these subjects, which is very relevant given the conversation. MEMORY 1, while connecting to Co-worker A's talent and specific skills, doesn't directly tie back to the current point of discussion and thus lacks immediate relevance.\n\nChoice: 2"
