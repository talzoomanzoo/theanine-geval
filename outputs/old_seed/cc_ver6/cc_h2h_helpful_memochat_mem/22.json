    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides specific information about Co-worker A's efforts and challenges regarding responsibility and personal improvement, such as punctuality and drinking habits, as well as past leadership roles and mutual support. This closely aligns with the dialogue context where Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's past struggles and successes. MEMORY 2, while related to personal improvement, lacks the same level of detail concerning Co-worker A's specific past experiences and their significance, making it less relevant for responding to the dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 1"
