I also gathered some personal accounts from our clients that show how the opposing side's actions affected them negatively. ### Co-workers B: Hmm. Sounds like you're well prepared. But what about the other side? They must have some evidence too, right? ### Co-workers A: Yes, they will have their own evidence to present. But I am confident that our argument is stronger. Our evidence is more compelling and clearly supports our position. ### Co-workers B: I hope you're right. Have you thought about how you're going to present your evidence in court? ### Co-workers A: Yes, I have. I plan to present my evidence clearly and concisely so that the judge cannot ignore it.
