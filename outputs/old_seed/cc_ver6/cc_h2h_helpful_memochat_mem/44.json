    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides relevant context about the strong emotional support and companionship between Neighbor A and Neighbor B, emphasizing their shared activities like walking to the park and spending time together. This is directly useful as Neighbor B suggests going for a walk to help Neighbor A cope with their feelings. MEMORY 2, while providing an example of support during a previous bereavement, adds more specific past details that don't directly relate to the current relationship issue Neighbor A is facing, making it slightly less relevant for the context.\n\nChoice: 1"
