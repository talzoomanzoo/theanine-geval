You are an amazing person and you deserve someone who appreciates you for who you are. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbor A recently moved into the neighborhood and wanted to live in a nicer area, which is why they have a bit of a drive to get to the park where they meet with Neighbor B. This change led to both of them enjoying going for walks together, especially to the park. As a result, Neighbor B is offering support and companionship to Neighbor A during their difficult time. \n\nNeighbor A was tired of living in a run-down apartment complex and wanted to improve their quality of life, which caused them and Neighbor B to become neighbors who catch up outside of their neighborhood. This connection led to both of them enjoying going for walks together, especially to the park, and developing a close friendship where they have shared memories of spending time together in the park.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nNeighbors B is a friendly individual who enjoys spending time outdoors, particularly in the park. They value safety and cleanliness in their environment and are open to making new friends. Neighbors B is also known for offering help and emotional support to others in tough times.\n\nRelationship Description:\nThe relationship between Neighbors B and Neighbors A is characterized by mutual agreement and understanding.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides relevant information about Neighbors B's personality traits, particularly their ability to offer emotional support in tough times, which fits the current context of consoling Neighbor A after their breakup. Their relationship characterization as supportive and understanding also aligns well with Neighbor B's attempt to uplift Neighbor A's spirits. MEMORY 1, while providing some context about their shared activities, does not specifically enhance the understanding of Neighbor B's emotional support role in this situation.\n\nChoice: 2"
