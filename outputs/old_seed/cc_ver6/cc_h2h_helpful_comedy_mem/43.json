    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context involves Neighbor A discussing their emotional distress after a breakup and feeling lost. Memory 1 contains information about Neighbor A's current emotional struggles and grief, which directly relates to the dialogue context by highlighting their need for emotional support. Memory 2, while mentioning activities and shared interests between Neighbors A and B, does not include specific information about Neighbor A's emotional situation or needs during this difficult time. Therefore, Memory 1 is more helpful as it provides relevant context about Neighbor A's emotional state that Neighbor B can use in their response.\n\nChoice: 1"
