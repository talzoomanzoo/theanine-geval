    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is about Classmates A confessing their feelings to Classmates B, who reciprocates the feelings and is open to exploring the possibility of a romantic relationship. This conversation is centered around feelings, trust, and open communication. Memory 2 provides more information related to their personal interactions, such as sharing support, trust, and engaging in activities that relieve stress, highlighting the closeness and understanding between them. Additionally, it mentions how Classmates A helped Classmates B with stress and self-compassion, which aligns with the emotional and supportive tone of the dialogue. On the other hand, Memory 1 is more focused on the classroom setting, trust issues, and a previous secret, which doesn't directly relate to the emotional exchange in the dialogue context. Therefore, Memory 2 is more relevant and helpful for crafting a response that acknowledges their supportive and developing relationship.\n\nChoice: 2"
