I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. \nSpeaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me.\nSpeaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house. \nSpeaker B: Understandable. Have you ever tried contacting animal control? That's how I got Bandicoot. I was working that day and animal control came by explaining about needing fosters for raccoons. I thought it was weird, so I did it and began to work at the small raccoon cafe that is part of the zoo. I love it. \nSpeaker A: That is a good idea.  Maybe they could help move them to a safer area.  I have a lot of traffic around and they could get hit if they are coming to my place all the time.  Have you been able to teach your raccoon any tricks?\nSpeaker B: The only trick I was able to teach him, that I deeply regret, was how locks worked. I thought it was cool at first, you know, to see a raccoon unlock a door. And now, I regret it so much. I've had to change the layout of my apartment and put deadbolts on my doors so that Bandicoot can't get out. And, he is sneaky about it. One time, he unlocked the pantry and was eating some cookies! It's like having a toddler that never grows up.\nSpeaker A: That is bad I guess.  Do you keep all of your chemicals, poisons, and medications up and locked?  I would hate to think what might happen if Bandicoot got into any of that.  Hey, when you drive do you lock him up in a cage or let him wander around in the car?  That could be dangerous for you driving and he freaks out. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A is interested in animals, specifically raccoons and bearded dragons. Speaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes. \nSpeaker B considers raccoons intelligent and funny. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly. Speaker B's garbage has a lock to prevent animals from getting into it, especially during windy weather. \nSpeaker A fosters dogs till they find a forever home. Speaker B works at a Raccoon Cafe and takes care of Bandicoot, a raccoon. Speaker B has a dog named Bandicoot and is willing to bring him over for extra company.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B works at a Raccoon Cafe and takes care of Bandicoot, a raccoon.\n2. Speaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n3. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly.\n4. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n5. Speaker B considers raccoons intelligent and funny.\n6. Speaker A has not interacted closely with raccoons but admires them.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 includes specific pieces of information relevant to the conversation, such as Speaker B working at a Raccoon Cafe, taking care of Bandicoot, and attempting to train him. It highlights Speaker B's view on raccoons as intelligent and potentially good pets, which aligns more directly with Speaker B's last dialogue about Bandicoot unlocking doors. Both memories mention Speaker A's raccoon problem and plans for aluminum sheeting, but MEMORY 2 provides a clear structure that directly relates to the present discussion about raccoon interactions and insights.\n\nChoice: 2"
