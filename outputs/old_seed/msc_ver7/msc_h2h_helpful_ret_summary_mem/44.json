I have a few tricks up my sleeve to deal with people like you.\nSpeaker A: Oh geez that makes me sound difficult.lol  Do you have any new speeches coming up?\nSpeaker B: Nope, I just cleared my schedule until the Alps marathon that you're training for.

I'll have more motivation tomorrow.  Today was a long work day.lol\nSpeaker B: I'm going to try a new motivational technique with you. Would you be more frightened by a spider or a snake.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context revolves around motivation for running, training for a marathon, and mutual support between Speaker A and B. MEMORY 2 provides relevant information about both speakers' backgrounds and current motivations. It mentions Speaker A training for a marathon and looking for recovery advice, which aligns with their need for a motivational speaker. It also highlights Speaker B's experience with marathons and their role as a motivational speaker, which is directly relevant to their interactions in the dialogue. MEMORY 1 includes some useful information, but it also contains additional details that are less pertinent to the specific context of motivational speaking and the current dialogue, such as fishing and feeling depressed.\n\nChoice: 2"
