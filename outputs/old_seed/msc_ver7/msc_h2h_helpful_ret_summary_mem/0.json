    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant about the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B enjoys watching swimming movies and wants to listen to punk music while swimming and learning programming. \nSpeaker A has known how to swim since the age of 5 and offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming. \nSpeaker B's favorite food is a pizzaburger and is looking forward to eating it in a pool with punk music playing.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n2. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n3. Speaker B is looking forward to eating a pizza burger in a pool with punk music playing.\n4. Speaker A knows how to swim since the age of 5.\n5. Speaker B does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies.\n6. Speaker A finds swimming relaxing and uses it to destress from their job.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 provide relevant context about Speaker A's ability to teach swimming and Speaker B's interest in learning. However, MEMORY 2 offers a more comprehensive and structured list of information, including additional relevant points such as Speaker A's stress-relief connection to swimming and Speaker B's enjoyment of swimming movies, which could be useful in the swimming learning context. This additional information can enable a more engaging and context-rich response.\n\nChoice: 2"
