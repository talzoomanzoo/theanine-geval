MEMORY 1 discusses the visiting plan and flight considerations, providing some context about why Speaker B is interested in visiting but doesn't connect it to Speaker A's current weather situation or any plans during the visit. MEMORY 2 provides details directly related to the upcoming visit, including travel plans that align with the desired scheduling and pricing, and also includes a relevant point about the warm weather, which ties back to Speaker A's remark about lovely weather. Additionally, MEMORY 2 provides extra context about exciting activities planned, which may contribute to discussions about the visit's anticipation.\n\nChoice: 2"
