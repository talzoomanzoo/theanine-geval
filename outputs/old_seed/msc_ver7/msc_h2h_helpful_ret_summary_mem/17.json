    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is about Speaker A's soccer position when they played in college. MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 both mention that Speaker A plays as a striker, which directly answers the question in the dialogue context. Both memories contain this relevant detail. However, MEMORY 2 has additional information about Speaker B's soccer experience, which could potentially shape the response by making the conversation more relatable or personal for Speaker B. Despite that, MEMORY 2 does not add more to the direct answer of the question compared to MEMORY 1.\n\nChoice: tie"
