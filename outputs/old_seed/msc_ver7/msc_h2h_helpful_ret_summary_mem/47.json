    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant about the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive.\nSpeaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price?\nSpeaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music\nSpeaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it.\nSpeaker A: I'll keep trying! Have you had any luck lately?\nSpeaker B: No I haven't! I keep hoping that I will so I can buy my dreamhouse but I know the chances are low.\nSpeaker A: Would you move to the city? It'd be too much for me\nSpeaker B: I would love to be able to have a country house and a city house to be able to come and go to each one as I please. doesn't that sound like a dream come true?\nSpeaker A: It would be convenient for seeing concerts in the city, yes. I'm not used to the business, though\nSpeaker B: Yeah I understand that. Have you listened to any new blues songs lately? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A expresses interest in potentially moving out of the city and enjoying a more peaceful life on the farm. Speaker B shares the same desire and dreams of having a city and country house or a summer and winter home.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\n2. Both speakers dream of having a city and country house or a summer and winter home.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n4. Speaker B appreciates the convenience of city living but also values what the country has to offer.\n5. Both speakers acknowledge the pros and cons of city and country living.\n6. Speaker A lives on a farm and is inviting Speaker B and their kids to attend a Quaker City Night Hawks concert.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The last question that Speaker B asks relates to listening to blues songs, which was mentioned earlier by Speaker A as something they enjoy on their new iPhone. The new information needed to respond should be about their mutual interest in blues music, concerts, or similar topics. MEMORY 2, which discusses a shared interest in concerts and a bit more context about their lifestyle, like living on a farm, provides relevant cues about attending a concert together. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, only touches on living arrangements and does not tie back into the music or concert angle, making it less relevant for responding to the question about blues songs.\n\nChoice: 2"
