It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A has known how to swim since the age of 5 and offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\nSpeaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming. \nSpeaker B does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies, which causes Speaker A to plan a snorkeling trip and sign up for several trips. As a result, Speaker A is planning a snorkeling trip and wants to travel to the Caribbean for their next trip.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n2. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n3. Speaker A has planned to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination.\n4. Speaker A has planned a cruise to the Caribbeans.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n6. Speaker A is planning a snorkeling trip and has signed up for several trips.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The relevant information needed from the memory to respond to the last utterance in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is the fact that Speaker A is excited about going to the Caribbean and has planned a cruise to the Carolinas, but has never been. MEMORY 2 contains this specific information about the cruise to the Caribbean (a planned cruise) and the snorkeling trip, which is directly related to the last context. Meanwhile, MEMORY 1 provides excessive details about swimming movies and doesn't clearly establish Speaker A's upcoming Caribbean trip, which is crucial for a response to the last part of the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 2"
