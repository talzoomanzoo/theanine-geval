Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too?\nSpeaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also?\nSpeaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A enjoys working with animals and has penguins at the zoo. Speaker B is excited about the opportunity at the zoo and is looking for a new job. Speaker B has elderly terriers and is planning to leave their part-time job for a break before starting a new one.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is centered around Speaker A's experience with their pets, specifically a pet named Journey who ate pizza and general discussions about pets getting into food. Memory 2 provides detailed and relevant information about the pets involved in the conversation, such as the names of Speaker A's pets (Journey and Sid), the type of pet Journey is (a raccoon), and references to the pets' behaviors which have been discussed in the dialogue context. Memory 1, while providing some general context about Speaker B having elderly terriers, includes irrelevant information about Speaker B's job situation and lacks specific details about the pets that are part of the current dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 2"
