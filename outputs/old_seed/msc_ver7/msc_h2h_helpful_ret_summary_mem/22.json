    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant about the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go?\nSpeaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker B is dedicated to studying sports medicine on the way to college, resulting in all A's in the sports medicine class, while Speaker A struggles with maintaining good grades and excels only in gym.\n2. Speaker B is focused on sports medicine training and is preparing for an exam in that subject, feeling pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n3. Speaker B is studying sports medicine in college, while Speaker A finds history class boring and challenging, both feeling overwhelmed by external pressures and expectations.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B has been getting all A's in the sports medicine class.\n2. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n3. Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring.\n4. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n5. Speaker A wishes to get better grades and is hopeful for a soccer scholarship.\n6. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories contain relevant information about Speaker B's focus on sports medicine and their academic performance, as well as Speaker A's challenges with grades and specific subjects. Memory 2 provides additional details about Speaker A's interest in a soccer scholarship, which could be helpful if the conversation shifts to future plans or aspirations. However, the key focus of the dialogue context is on exams and academic subjects, which both memories address. Memory 1 presents the information in a more concise manner, directly highlighting the pertinent details without additional context. Since both memories cover the main points about Speaker B's and Speaker A's academic situations, choosing between the two primarily comes down to conciseness versus additional context that might be less relevant to the current dialogue focus.\n\nChoice: tie"
