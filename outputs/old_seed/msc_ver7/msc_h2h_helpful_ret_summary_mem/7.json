    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT shows that Speaker B enjoys rock music but does not play an instrument, while Speaker A seems interested in Speaker B's musical preferences and might want to connect through music-related activities or interests. Memory 1 and Memory 2 both provide similar relevant information about Speaker A being in a band and playing an instrument, which can facilitate a musical connection with Speaker B. However, Memory 2 contains additional specific information about Speaker A not attending many concerts other than their own, which could be more directly relatable to Speaker B's interest in rock music, and it also provides a contrast in hobbies/failures in school, which could further aid conversation development.\n\nChoice: 2"
