How good is their zoo?\nSpeaker B: Their zoo is pretty good! It's always crowded, of course, but they have pandas so I'm happy. I would say it's bigger than the DC zoo, but I like that the DC zoo has fewer people.\nSpeaker A: That sounds awesome.  I haven't been to the zoo in so long.  I wish I could go. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B enjoy visiting the zoo, with Speaker A preferring exotic birds and enjoying seeing pandas and penguins, while Speaker B's girlfriend also enjoys pandas and penguins and they visit the zoo regularly. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend, and Speaker A prefers cockatoos over kittens as pets.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo.\n2. Speaker A has been to the zoo before and enjoys seeing exotic birds.\n3. Speaker B's girlfriend enjoys pandas and penguins at the zoo, and they go to the zoo every few weeks.\n4. Speaker A enjoys seeing pandas and penguins at the zoo and goes with their sister.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss hobbies and interests, with Speaker A enjoying gardening and reading, and Speaker B enjoying visiting the zoo.\n6. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides relevant information that Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend, which is directly related to the initial question in the dialogue context. Additionally, it mentions that both speakers enjoy visiting the zoo and that Speaker B's girlfriend shares the interest in pandas and penguins. This enriches the conversation about the zoo and potentially their trip to San Diego, making Speaker B's utterances more meaningful. MEMORY 2 contains more detailed points but focuses less on the immediate and potential conversational relevance of the discussed topics.\n\nChoice: 1"
