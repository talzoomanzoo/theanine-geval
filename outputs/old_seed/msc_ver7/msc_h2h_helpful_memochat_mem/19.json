Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \nSpeaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along!\nSpeaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them.\nSpeaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me!\nSpeaker A: Hahaha. Yes I agree its too hot to get a long hike in. I've been on some short ones, but the bugs eat me alive. I like to hike in the fall when the bugs are dying off and its a little cooler.\nSpeaker B: Ah yes, that's my favorite time of year. Oh and speaking of Tasha, I'm still amazed she knows Mandarin. Have you been learning more of the language?\nSpeaker A: I've been learning a little more. I try to learn a few things a day. Tasha's reactions to my talking to myself in Mandarin is funny, she looks confused most of the time. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A has a pet parrot named Tasha who speaks Mandarin and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten. \nSpeaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities. \n\nSpeaker B lives in the city they grew up in, loves animals, and has a cat that recently had a kitten. \nSpeaker A has a pet named Tasha who speaks Mandarin and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Adopting Kittens and Training Pets', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker B talks about adopting out a rescue kitten, and Speaker A discusses adopting a kitten and training it to get along with the parrot.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: Do you still want to adopt out your new resucue kitten? ### Speaker B: Yes, I have just finished filling out and submitting all of the adoption paperwork to the animal rescue. And good news, all kittens are feeling better and are healthy again. I love them. ### Speaker A: That's great news! Do you have any names picked out for them or are you going to keep their names? ### Speaker B: I do not have any names picked out for them yet. I have been trying to get to know their personalities better before I give them a name. Two of them are very spunky and one is shy. Maybe I will give them a Mandarin name! Do you have any recommendations as you are learning Mandarin? ### Speaker A: Hm, maybe Zhao for one of them! I always thought that name sounded cool ### Speaker B: Oh, how interesting! I have a friend who's surname is Zhao. What does Zhao mean in Mandarin? ### Speaker A: I believe it's just the name of a state, it doesn't really have a meaning.  ### Speaker B: Oh, okay. Are you able to adopt any cats since you have a parrot? I do not know if those two species get along. ### Speaker A: I can! My parrot would be fine with the extra friend, I would just need to train the kitten to see him as a friend rather than a foe, ha! ### Speaker B: I will pass on any training tips that I acquire as I train the new kittens. My older cat is so mellow that I have never had any issues training her. But two on the little kittens seem like they will be a handful to train.
