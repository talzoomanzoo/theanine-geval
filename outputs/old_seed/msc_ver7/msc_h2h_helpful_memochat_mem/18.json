Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too?\nSpeaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet!

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides information about Speaker B's dogs being elderly terriers and gives background on their professional life, which might be somewhat relevant if Speaker B mentions their dogs in the response. However, MEMORY 2 offers detailed context about previous interactions specifically about pets (raccoon, bearded dragon, and terriers) that directly align with the ongoing conversation about pets and their behaviors. It provides more thorough contextual understanding about the pets involved, especially Journey's habits, which reinforces the details mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nChoice: 2"
