But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Teaching and Career Paths', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B explore the idea of teaching and career options related to their fields.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: Yup I already volunteer at my mom's after school program. But I am looking to do more high level volunteering at the neighboring university in our town. Have you ever thought about maybe teaching at a college? ### Speaker A: Maybe community college, but it would have to courses in computer science.  I'd like to get involved with robotics. There is a lot of opportunity in this field and being able to teach it can really help advance my expertise. ### Speaker B: Yeah I feel like you could do so much with a computer science degree. It's really cool there are so many options! I feel a little bit stuck studying linguistics.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides specific information about both speakers, such as Speaker B's major in Linguistics and consideration of becoming a college professor, which directly aligns with their decision to get into teaching. It also mentions Speaker A's study of computer science and interest in teaching, providing context for why Speaker A suggests teaching as a career option. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 mainly provides a summary of related topics and past dialogues without offering detailed insights into Speaker B's thoughts about teaching or Speaker A's career perspective. \n\nChoice: 1"
