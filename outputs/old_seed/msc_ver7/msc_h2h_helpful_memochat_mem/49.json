    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides comprehensive information about both speakers, including Speaker A's enjoyment of grilling and making fajitas, suggesting a potential response about pairing grilled asparagus with an existing knowledge about fajitas. It also implies Speaker A's preference for beef or chicken fajitas might be based on their cooking expertise. It sets context for the dialogue about grilled asparagus and fajitas directly mentioned in the Dialogue Context. In contrast, MEMORY 2 focuses more on volunteering at the animal shelter rather than cooking or food preferences, which is less directly relevant to the given dialogue context. Therefore, MEMORY 1 is more helpful as it contains relevant information that directly addresses the topic of conversation in the Dialogue Context.\n\nChoice: 1"
