    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 2 provides information that is directly relevant to the topic of motivational speaking, which is the main focus of the dialogue context. It highlights Speaker B's experience and personal connection to motivational speaking, as well as how it helps them deal with personal struggles. This is particularly relevant given that Speaker B is offering to be Speaker A's motivational speaker to help with marathon training, and it supports Speaker B's credibility in this role. Conversely, Memory 1, while providing background on Speaker A and B's running interests and plans, does not directly address the aspect of motivational speaking or Speaker B's recent or upcoming speeches beyond marathons, which is the current topic of conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
