In addition, Speaker A plans to leave a hammock by the river for anyone to use at a hidden spot off the main hiking trail. This plan changed as Speaker A now has a portable hammock for the hike and asks if Speaker B will bring theirs.\n\nSpeaker B, who does not vote, wants their neighbor John to know about their stance on group equality. This desire is caused by the fact that Speaker B's neighbor, John, is getting divorced and selling top-of-the-line camping gear. Additionally, Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Working at a Grocery Store', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A talks about applying to work at a grocery store near the hiking trail.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: Will do, I'll ask him if he knows anyone how is looking to hire also. ### Speaker A: I applied to work at a grocery store.  ### Speaker B: Oh good! Is it the local market or another one? ### Speaker A: It's the one by the hiking trail. Then I could go for hikes after work.  ### Speaker B: That's a great store. I think you'll like working there. My friend worked there for a while and she loved the people. And that's a great trail, too.

Meanwhile, MEMORY 1 contains unrelated details about Speaker A's and Speaker B's activities and plans, which have no direct relevance to the conversation about the job offer.\n\nChoice: 2"
