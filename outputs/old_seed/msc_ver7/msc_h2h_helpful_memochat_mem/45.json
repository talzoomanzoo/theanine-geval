Know anyone? \nSpeaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better.

Is it too late to change my mind?lol\nSpeaker B: Yes. We have an iron-clad written agreement. Tell me how I'm doing so far. Is this the most motivated you've ever been in your entire life?\nSpeaker A: No, but that's why I have you.  You're going to push me to do the things I can't bring myself to do.  I'll have more motivation tomorrow.  Today was a long work day.lol\nSpeaker B: I'm going to try a new motivational technique with you. Would you be more frightened by a spider or a snake. I need to know before we meet up this weekend.\nSpeaker A: A spider no question but if you ask me to hold one I'm definitely running away. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B, who is from San Francisco and enjoys fishing and the outdoors, has experience running a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding. Speaker A, on the other hand, is training for marathons and seeking advice on recovery. In response, Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and planning to meet at the beach at 0600.\n\nSpeaker B, known for being a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks, also joked about combining fishing with feeling depressed and mentioned taking young boys to the pond during school hours.\n\nAdditionally, Speaker B, who travels frequently for work and misses their wife and kids, found running a marathon tough yet rewarding. In a conversation with Speaker A, who is training for marathons and seeking advice on recovery, Speaker A suggested combining something more active with feeling depressed to avoid dwelling on negative thoughts.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Motivational Speaking', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker B shares about being a motivational speaker and how it helps them overcome personal struggles.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: I'm a motivational speaker!
