That's why I often need some time to decompress and be active. ### Speaker B: At least it is rewarding. Being active is amazing, I have yet to try playing badminton. ### Speaker A: Because my job is flexible, I have been thinking of taking a second part time job to help save money to travel to Sweden.  ### Speaker B: That's awesome! Its so important to take time off and vacation. I can tell you all the cool spots to check out in Sweden. Maybe we could go together since I miss Sweden so much.. I had so many great memories there. ### Speaker A: Yeah that would be great. What would you recommend first that we do when we get there? ### Speaker B: For a newcomer, I'd recommend checking out the volcanos.
