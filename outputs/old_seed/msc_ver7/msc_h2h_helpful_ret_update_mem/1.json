    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant about the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A has known how to swim since the age of 5 and offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\nSpeaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming. \nSpeaker B does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies, which causes Speaker A to plan a snorkeling trip and sign up for several trips. As a result, Speaker A is planning a snorkeling trip and wants to travel to the Caribbean for their next trip.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n2. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n4. Speaker A is planning a snorkeling trip and has signed up for several trips.\n5. Speaker A plans to travel to the Caribbean for their next trip.\n6. Speaker B is afraid of cruises because they can't swim.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 gives a clearer context for Speaker B's fear of cruises due to not knowing how to swim, which explains their earlier comment about learning to swim. This makes it more helpful in understanding Speaker B’s motivations and potential concerns about going to the Caribbean or on other trips. Moreover, it confirms that there’s a conversation about future trips including cruises, which aligns closely with the dialogue context where Speaker B mentions possibly joining a cruise. This context helps Speaker A respond more meaningfully to Speaker B's interest in future trips and concerns about swimming.\n\nChoice: 2"
