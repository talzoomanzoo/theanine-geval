Speaker A is a fan of Arsenal and enjoys watching international teams play.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context involves a question about the specific soccer position Speaker A played in college. The helpful memory should provide relevant information about Speaker A's current or past soccer involvement, particularly related to positions or roles played.\n\nChoice: 1\n\nMemory 1 explicitly mentions Speaker A plays soccer as a striker, which directly answers the question about the position played. While it doesn't confirm it was the same position in college, it is directly related to Speaker A's soccer activities. Memory 2 contains the same information but includes additional unrelated details. Memory 1, being more concise, is simpler for Speaker B to draw a conclusion about Speaker A's current or past soccer position."
