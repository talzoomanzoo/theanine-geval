But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also?\nSpeaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A enjoys working with animals and has penguins at the zoo. Speaker B is excited about the opportunity at the zoo and is looking for a new job.

MEMORY 2 provides specific information about Speaker A's and B's pets, which is highly relevant to the ongoing conversation about the behaviors of their pets. It mentions Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid, and Speaker B has terriers, which directly connects to the dialogue about pets getting into food. This information allows Speaker B to make informed and relevant responses related to Speaker A's pets. \n\nChoice: 2"
