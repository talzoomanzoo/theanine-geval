    "prediction": "Explanation: In the dialogue context, Speaker B mentions that they have exams coming up and are still studying for them. It is crucial to identify memories that relate directly to Speaker B's studying habits, academic pressures, and feelings toward exams. MEMORY 1 provides insights into Speaker B's dedication and academic pressure regarding sports medicine, which aligns closely with their mention of upcoming exams in the context. MEMORY 2, while similar, provides additional information regarding Speaker B's feelings of pressure and Speaker A's advice, but also contains redundant details regarding overall schooling pressures that are less directly relevant to the context of studying for imminent exams.\n\nChoice: 1"
