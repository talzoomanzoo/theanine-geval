    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides more relevant context to Speaker A mentioning reading books and enjoying grandchildren by noting that Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix. It also aligns with the context of their independent nature, which ties to Speaker A having free time to check out a new book. In contrast, MEMORY 2 provides details that are less related to the current discussion about interests in books or preferences, mostly focusing on aspects of grandchildren entertaining themselves and indirectly tying to Speaker B's interest in animals. \n\nChoice: 1"
