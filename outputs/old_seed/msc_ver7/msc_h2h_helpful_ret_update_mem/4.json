Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot.  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country, while Speaker B is from Sweden and mentioned playing tennis and going to church on Sunday. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip, causing Speaker B to recommend checking out the volcanoes in Sweden for a unique experience.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n4. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n5. Speaker B recommends checking out the volcanoes in Sweden for a unique experience.\n6. Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains information about Speaker B being from Sweden and suggests activities like playing tennis or going to church on Sunday, which are unrelated to the current discussion about places to visit in Sweden. MEMORY 2 provides more context about Speaker B recommending the volcanoes in Sweden for a unique experience, which is directly relevant to Speaker A's inquiry about must-see locations in Sweden. This makes MEMORY 2 more helpful in enabling Speaker A to respond to the dialogue context appropriately.\n\nChoice: 2"
