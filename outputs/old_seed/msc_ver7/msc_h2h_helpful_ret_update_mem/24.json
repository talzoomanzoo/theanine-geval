    "prediction": "Explanation: The last utterance in the dialogue context refers to Speaker A's plans for a trip to Italy next spring and asks Speaker B about their future plans to visit Italy. Therefore, information about whether Speaker B has been to Italy before and their experiences or plans related to Italy will be most relevant and useful for Speaker B to respond appropriately. MEMORY 2 provides specific information that Speaker B has been to Italy in the past and enjoyed the food there, which is directly relevant to the question asked by Speaker A about future trips to Italy. This can enable Speaker B to give a more contextually appropriate response based on past experiences and potential interest in future visits. MEMORY 1, while containing information about visiting Greece and suggestions for Speaker A's trip, doesn't specifically address any past or future plans Speaker B has regarding Italy, which is the focus of the last utterance in the dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 2"
