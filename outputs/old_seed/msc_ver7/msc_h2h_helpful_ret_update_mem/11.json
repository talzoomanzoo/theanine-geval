    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant about the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\nSpeaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach?\nSpeaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B wants to turn their linguistics major into a practical job, while Speaker A wants to develop apps for differently abled youth through studying computer science. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics. \nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science, while Speaker B is considering further education to become a college professor in linguistics, feeling limited in job opportunities.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n3. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n4. Speaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\n5. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n6. Speaker B lives with their mom and is currently in college.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides relevant information about both speakers' career aspirations and aligns well with the Dialogue Context, where Speaker B is considering career options like teaching English or history. It notes Speaker A is studying computer science and wants to teach robotics, which fits with the Dialogue Context discussion. The mention of job opportunities for Speaker B and their consideration for further education as a college professor is directly related to their considerations in the Dialogue Context. The additional detail about Speaker A working to pay for college is also contextually relevant as it aligns with the academic and career focus of the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 1"
