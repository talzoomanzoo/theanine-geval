    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant about the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive.\nSpeaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price?\nSpeaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music\nSpeaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it.\nSpeaker A: I'll keep trying! Have you had any luck lately?\nSpeaker B: No I haven't! I keep hoping that I will so I can buy my dreamhouse but I know the chances are low.\nSpeaker A: Would you move to the city? It'd be too much for me\nSpeaker B: I would love to be able to have a country house and a city house to be able to come and go to each one as I please. doesn't that sound like a dream come true?\nSpeaker A: It would be convenient for seeing concerts in the city, yes. I'm not used to the business, though\nSpeaker B: Yeah I understand that. Have you listened to any new blues songs lately? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A expresses interest in potentially moving out of the city and enjoying a more peaceful life on the farm. Speaker B shares the same desire and dreams of having a city and country house or a summer and winter home.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description: Speaker B is a city dweller who appreciates a peaceful and quiet life, with a preference for winter and a dislike for country music. They have kids who are picky about milk and enjoy the convenience of city living, but also miss the culture and late-night availability of products in the city. Speaker B dreams of owning a city and country house and enjoys fresh produce and fresh air.\n\nRelationship Description: Speaker A suggests a band show for Speaker B to attend during winter break and invites them to stay over at the farm. They joke about kids asking for a cow if they enjoy milking them and agree on the importance of kids understanding where food comes from.\n\nEvent Description: Speaker A buys lottery tickets with Speaker B, who buys 20 tickets with the same numbers for a big jackpot. Speaker A buys 50 tickets with different numbers, and Speaker B has a crazy idea to increase their chances of winning. Despite the difference in approach, Speaker A and Speaker B bond over the excitement of potentially winning the jackpot.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 is more focused on the shared dream of having a city and country house, which directly relates to the last part of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B mentions this aspiration. MEMORY 2, while providing more detailed context about Speaker B's lifestyle and preferences, does not specifically address the recent conversation about city and country houses and blues music. The shared interest in a peaceful life and the ability to attend concerts from the city relates more closely to the ongoing dialogue.\n\nChoice: 1"
