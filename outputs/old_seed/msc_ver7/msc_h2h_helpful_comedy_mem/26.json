    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more helpful because it provides background details about the interests and relationship between Speaker A and Speaker B. It highlights Speaker A's curiosity about energy and space exploration, and the playful and engaging dynamic between the two speakers. This information is relevant given Speaker A's surprise about having trees indoors and their intrigue, which suggests openness to novelty, aligning with the interest in unusual ideas like space plants. MEMORY 1, while mentioning gardening and space plants, lacks the rich relational context and shared interests that MEMORY 2 provides, making it less directly relevant to Speaker B's potential response.\n\nChoice: 2"
