I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\nSpeaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach?\nSpeaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option.\nSpeaker A: Yes I think history is interesting, too!

Right now I am really getting into the weeds of World War II. There's so much to unpack. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B, majoring in linguistics and aspiring to turn it into a practical job, causes Speaker A to be interested in teaching computer science, particularly in the field of robotics.\nSpeaker B, living with their mom and currently in college, wants to pursue a masters degree after finishing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. This leads Speaker B to feel limited in job opportunities but also sparks an interest in studying linguistics.\nSpeaker B, majoring in linguistics and hoping to turn it into a practical job, wants Speaker A, who is studying computer science and aims to develop apps for differently abled youth, to be interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nSpeaker B is an amateur soccer player who enjoys playing a variety of games such as World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Elder Scrolls Series, Legend of Zelda, and Super Mario Bros. Series. They like to hang out with friends and play most games except for 1st person shooters.

    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 provides specific detail about Speaker B's academic focus on linguistics and their potential career aspirations, which directly relates to the current dialogue topic of teaching and history. It also connects to Speaker A's interest in teaching computer science and robotics. On the other hand, Memory 2 includes information about gaming and volunteering, which are less directly related to the current dialogue context about academic subjects and teaching careers.\n\nChoice: 1"
