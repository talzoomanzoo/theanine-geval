Where are you going on vacation?\nSpeaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there!\nSpeaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo?\nSpeaker B: Their zoo is pretty good! It's always crowded, of course, but they have pandas so I'm happy. I would say it's bigger than the DC zoo, but I like that the DC zoo has fewer people.\nSpeaker A: That sounds awesome.  I haven't been to the zoo in so long.  I wish I could go. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B enjoy visiting the zoo, with Speaker A preferring exotic birds and enjoying seeing pandas and penguins, while Speaker B's girlfriend also enjoys pandas and penguins and they visit the zoo regularly. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend, and Speaker A prefers cockatoos over kittens as pets.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description: Speaker A is a hard-working individual who works at a local fast food restaurant. They enjoy reading and gardening, and have a preference for visiting the zoo. Speaker A has a sister who recently got married and they like to see pandas, penguins, and exotic birds at the zoo. \n\nRelationship Description: Speaker A and Speaker B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as seen when Speaker A suggested Speaker B to adopt a kitten and they discussed their preferences regarding pets. They also share a love for animals and enjoy visiting the zoo together.\n\nEvent Description: Speaker A's sister got married, Speaker B's cat had a kitten, Speaker A and Speaker B discussed their preferences for pets, Speaker B's girlfriend got a cockatoo, Speaker B mentioned about giving away kittens, Speaker A compared having children to having pets, and Speaker B's sister's cockatoo named John behaves in a funny way.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses on a conversation about visiting the zoo and potentially adopting a kitten. MEMORY 1 has relevant information about both speakers' experiences and preferences regarding visiting the zoo and adopting pets, which directly relate to the conversation about the zoo and having a kitten. MEMORY 2 also contains similar information, but adds extraneous details about Speaker A's life and events unrelated to the dialogue context. This makes MEMORY 1 more concise and focused on the aspects directly relevant to the ongoing conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
