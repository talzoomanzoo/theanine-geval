Thank you for the recommendation.\nSpeaker B: Of course. I recommend that movie to everyone I meet. I think I've watched it over one hundred times. So what is the next movie on your list to watch soon?\nSpeaker A: Yeah it was great and I will also recommend to people when they ask what movie is good. So next is another one you recommended which is coming to America. What’s the next movie your going to watch? \nSpeaker B: There is a horror genre movie that was released just this week which I'm going to watch tonight. It is called \"Girl Next.\"\nSpeaker A: Oh that sounds interesting, I will look into that and put it on my list. How has your job been going? Is there where you get all these great ideas for what to watch?  \nSpeaker B: My Film Studies professor job has been going absolutely great lately. I love all my students, because they really get into the lectures and ask lots of questions. Yes, my job requires me to watch movies all the time, so that is how I find the best ones. Is your programmer job going all right lately?\nSpeaker A: That sounds amazing. Super lucky to have students that really enjoy what they are learning about and I’m sure that’s down to the way you teach and what you teach them. I’m so glad it is all going well for you. Yeah it is going much better now, I’m really getting in the swing of things thank you for asking. \nSpeaker B: You're welcome. So, returning to the subject of Pulp Fiction, did you think it was funny? Did you think it was too violent for kids to watch?\nSpeaker A: Yeah there was some funny parts in that movie. I kinda think it may be a little to violent for kids, but I would just allow it to each parent to decide I would probably let my grandkids watch. What is your opinion? \nSpeaker B: I agree with you. As long as the parent can explain what's going on regarding the violence, and make sure the kid knows it is just a movie and not real life, I think most kids would be able to watch the movie without really being harmed or negatively influenced. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B, who has kids and enjoys watching movies with them, used to teach Film Studies and carefully chooses what movies to watch. Speaker B, who just turned 40 and considers themselves too old for certain activities, allowed their kids to watch Disney, Pixar, and older films like screwball comedies from the '30s and '40s, causing Speaker B to recommend \"Coming 2 America\" and \"I-SPY\" starring Eddie Murphy.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description: Speaker B is a 40-year-old former Film Studies teacher who enjoys teaching, reading, playing music, watching movies, and hiking.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue revolves around Speaker A and Speaker B discussing movies, their jobs, and a specific conversation about allowing children to watch \"Pulp Fiction.\" MEMORY 2 provides a comprehensive overview of Speaker B's former profession as a Film Studies teacher, their enjoyment of various film genres, and a specific focus on their concern for allowing kids to watch movies, including Disney, Pixar, and older films. It also details the relationship and interests of both speakers, which is directly relevant as it ties back to the themes being discussed in the dialogue. MEMORY 1, while offering some similar information, focuses more on Speaker B's age and activities considered too old, which is less pertinent to the ongoing conversation about film recommendations and appropriateness for children.\n\nChoice: 2"
