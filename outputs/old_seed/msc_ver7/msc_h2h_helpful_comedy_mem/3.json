    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant about the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal.\nSpeaker B: That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab!\nSpeaker A: Oh! I did not know that. Well if you can clone cows that's more ice cream for you! Haha. What's your favorite ice cream flavor?\nSpeaker B: Yes, more ice cream is always good, haha! I like a good rocky road, or pretty much any chocolate ice cream with nuts or stir-ins! I like most of Jeni's brand too. How about you? What is your favorite kind?\nSpeaker A: I am a big fan of cookie dough ice cream, and I love cheesecake flavored ice creams too! Ben & Jerry has some that I like, but I prefer to get ice cream from an ice cream shop.  It's just something about being in that environment,\nSpeaker B: Yes, ice cream shops are the best! They have stir-ins, and the smells are heavenly! Ben and Jerry's used to have a blueberry cheesecake that was amazing! I have only had that and their strawberry flavors. Both were great! \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B works on weekends at a research lab and has a deaf dog named Sparky, a beagle breed. Speaker A is considering getting a dog and already walks Speaker B's dog, Sparky. Speaker B has invented a chili dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\nSpeaker B is also a high school student preparing for college and works at a diner at night. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner, and Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce. Speaker A had cheesy ham and potato soup for dinner, and Speaker B has invented a chili dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nSpeaker B is a hardworking student ahead of college, working at a diner cooking hamburgers. They are interested in neuroscience, have a deaf dog named Sparky, and are planning to major in molecular biology. Speaker B is known for inventing a chili dog casserole and may take summer classes to get a head start on college.\n\nRelationship Description:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B share a close bond, discussing their love for dogs and food. Speaker A compliments Speaker B on being a great dog owner and offers to walk Sparky. They also plan to try Speaker B's famous hamburgers at the diner.\n\nEvent Description:\nEvents shared by Speaker A and Speaker B include discussing their dogs, sharing dinner choices, and talking about future plans. Speaker B invents a chili dog casserole and plans to clone a jersey cow. Speaker A recommends taking summer classes to get ahead in college.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The Dialogue Context revolves around Speaker B's interests, their willingness to continue working at the lab if classes become too challenging, and a discussion on ice cream flavors. It's relevant to know that Speaker B is hardworking, working at a diner cooking hamburgers, interested in molecular biology, has a deaf dog, and plans to take summer classes. These elements correlate with the ongoing conversation about Speaker B's interests and future plans concerning lab work and cloning.\n\nChoice: 2"
