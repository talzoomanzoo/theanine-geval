    "prediction": "Explanation: The last utterance in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT inquires about the position Speaker B played in college soccer. Therefore, relevant information from Speaker B's background would be most useful to provide context for an appropriate response. MEMORY 1 includes information that Speaker B played intramural soccer in college, which directly addresses the context of the last utterance, making it possible for Speaker B to mention the position they played. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, contains no information about Speaker B's position or soccer experience, focusing instead on Speaker A's soccer involvement and past work experience.\n\nChoice: 1"
