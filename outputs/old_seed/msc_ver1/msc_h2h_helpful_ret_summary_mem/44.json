Will you take them with you to your college dorm? \nSpeaker B: I'll be living off campus, so absolutely. How about you? Are you staying in the dorms?\nSpeaker A: I'm glad your taking them with you.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The conversation between the speakers revolves around their college living arrangements and owning pet snakes. Speaker A is considering living off-campus for freedom-related reasons, much like Speaker B. Both memories mention pet snakes, but MEMORY 1 provides detailed information about Speaker B's snake names, interests, and their reptiles' low maintenance, which is directly relevant to the current dialogue topic. MEMORY 2 offers information on broader topics like future studies and plans, which are not as immediately helpful for the current context of discussing living arrangements and pet management in college.\n\nChoice: 1"
