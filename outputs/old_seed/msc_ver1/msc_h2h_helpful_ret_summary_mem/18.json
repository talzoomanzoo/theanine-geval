Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\nSpeaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach?\nSpeaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option.\nSpeaker A: Yes I think history is interesting, too! Both of those subjects would be great because there are probably lots of teaching jobs. What kind of history do you like?\nSpeaker B: I love all sorts of history. Right now I am really getting into the weeds of World War II. There's so much to unpack.\nSpeaker A: For sure! So much happened and it really affected how the world is today. I like learning about the history of places where I have lived, it's really interesting.\nSpeaker B: That sounds really cool! What have you learned about where you currently live?\nSpeaker A: Oh, I found out that the big sports field used to be a farm where they grew wheat and raised cows! It's really cool to see places in old photos and see how they have changed. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\n3. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n4. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n5. Speaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\n6. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nSpeaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. Speaker B mentions feeling limited in job opportunities and is studying linguistics. Speaker A is studying computer science and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth, as well as being interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: In the dialogue context, Speaker B has been discussing their interest in teaching both English and history, as well as their interest in World War II. Meanwhile, Speaker A has shared about their interest in teaching robotics and learning about the history of places. MEMORY 2 includes the detail about Speaker A's interest in developing apps for differently abled youth, which can be relevant as it ties into their interest and possible future contributions in their field. Additionally, it provides a holistic view of Speaker B's study and career considerations, aligning well with the current discussion about teaching and job opportunities.\n\nChoice: 2"
