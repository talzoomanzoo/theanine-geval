    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains relevant information about Speaker B considering adopting a kitten, which is already known in the dialogue context. It also mentions that Speaker B enjoys visiting the zoo and has a cat that recently had a kitten, but these details do not directly relate to the immediate context of vacation plans. However, MEMORY 2 extensively repeats information about hobbies and visits to the zoo, which also does not add significant value to the immediate context of vacation plans. Nonetheless, MEMORY 2 mentions Speaker B's interest in adopting a kitten, aligning with the adoption topic in the dialogue. Neither memory provides significant details about vacation plans, but MEMORY 2 is slightly more relevant because it addresses Speaker B's potential adoption plans more directly.\n\nChoice: 2"
