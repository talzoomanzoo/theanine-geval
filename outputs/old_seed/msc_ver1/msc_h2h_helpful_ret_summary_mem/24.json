    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides specific information that is relevant to the conversation, such as the fact that Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey. This directly relates to the current situation where Journey ate a piece of pizza, as mentioned in the dialogue context. MEMORY 2, though containing some similar details, is more cluttered and does not clearly state that Journey is a raccoon until later, making MEMORY 1 more immediately relevant and useful for Speaker B to respond appropriately.\n\nChoice: 1"
