    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\nSpeaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call!\nSpeaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip?  \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n2. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n3. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n4. Speaker B has grandkids who are more interested in phones and tablets than musical instruments.\n5. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n6. Speaker B mentions having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nSpeaker A is a librarian and loves kids, mentioning having 3 children. This makes Speaker A busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. Consequently, Speaker B, who has a lot of kids all grown up with kids of their own, enjoys spending time with their grandkids at the park. This led Speaker B to take their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue ends with Speaker B asking Speaker A about their opinion or decision regarding an annual fishing trip. Relevant information from the memory should provide context about Speaker B's and Speaker A's perspectives on the fishing trip and their respective family situations.\n\nMEMORY 1 contains specific information about Speaker B's interest in making the fishing trip an annual tradition and mentions an experience with mixed reactions from their grandkids, which directly relates to the question posed in the dialogue. Moreover, it highlights Speaker A's work schedule, which is relevant when considering committing to a trip.\n\nMEMORY 2 also contains this relevant information, but includes additional background (such as Speaker A being a librarian) that, while related to their busyness, does not directly add value to the immediate context of fishing trips. \n\nBoth MEMORIES provide information about Speaker A's work commitments and Speaker B's interest in the annual fishing trip, which are both pertinent to the current context. However, MEMORY 1 is more concise and directly focused on the aspects most relevant to the dialogue context, without additional unrelated details.\n\nChoice: tie"
