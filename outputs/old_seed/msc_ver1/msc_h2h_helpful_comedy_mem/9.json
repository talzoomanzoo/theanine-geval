    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides more context and background information about the relationship between Speaker A and Speaker B. It mentions their shared experiences and plans, including the fact that they plan an annual fishing trip together, which is directly relevant to the last utterance. Additionally, it talks about Speaker B cherishing family moments and teases out more about libraries as a common interest, which could be relevant to the overall context of their discussions. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 repeats some information but doesn't provide as much detailed context about their shared history or plans.\n\nChoice: 1"
