What are you most excited about doing when you get there?\nSpeaker A: I'm extremely excited about the sunset tour. Each day is at a new location to watch the sunset. It's suppose to be romantic, but I am just going alone, so I see it as more calming than anything.\nSpeaker B: I hope you have a lot fun. It sounds like a nice time to get away from everything.
