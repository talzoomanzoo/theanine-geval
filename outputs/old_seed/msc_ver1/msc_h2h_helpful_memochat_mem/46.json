But even if you don't grill most nights, you could probably make enough barbeque to have left overs for a couple nights. That's usually what I do, because I don't really have the time or energy to grill every night. ### Speaker A: That's a good idea.  On nights when I'm grilling I'll probably enjoy it even more, but even when I don't have the time or energy I can still eat out there with some leftovers and still appreciate it.  You should come over and help break in the new stuff. ### Speaker B: Oh I would love to! There's actually a new marinade I've been wanting to try, so I'll I get a few cuts of meat marinating in that and bring that those over along with a six pack. ### Speaker A: That sounds like a great night.  We'll have to pick a night when the weather is really good.  I've got things set up so we can play music and enjoy the food and company without worrying about bugs or anything like that. ### Speaker B: That sounds like a plan to me! Speaking of the bugs, what are you using to keep them out? The bugs over at my place seem to be getting used to what I've been using. ### Speaker A: I use a few different devices and they seem to work well, including some lamps.  I'll go find the actual product names and get them to you.  But if all else fails, I've got some old fashioned bug spray that does the job!' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue. ###Speaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad. ###Speaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme.
