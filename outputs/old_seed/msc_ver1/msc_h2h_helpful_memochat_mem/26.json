Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too?\nSpeaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet!

How are your dogs doing anyways?\nSpeaker B: They've been better as I left my previous job so I'm spending more time with them, how do you manage to work full time and still keep those animals happy?\nSpeaker A: I think working at the zoo so long has helped.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides context about the previous relationship and discussions between Speaker A and Speaker B, including details about their pets, their work experience, and their preferences. This directly relates to the current dialogue context where they are discussing their pets and jobs. MEMORY 2, while providing some context about Speaker B's job search and interests, introduces a lot of new and specific information that wasn't present in the dialogue, such as the excitement about working at a zoo, which could lead away from relevant discussion points already present.\n\nChoice: 1"
