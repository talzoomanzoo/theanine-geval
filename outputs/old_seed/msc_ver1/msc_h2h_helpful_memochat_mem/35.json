    "prediction": "Explanation: \nIn MEMORY 1, there is a mention of Speaker A enjoying a Brazilian steakhouse with their brother, which directly relates to the current conversation where Speaker A talks about having Brazilian foods and steak. This connection could allow Speaker A to expand on their experience at the Brazilian steakhouse. In MEMORY 2, while it also mentions Speaker A and their brother going to a Brazilian steakhouse, it mainly contains information about Speaker B's houseboat and their preference for local holidays, which does not directly relate to the current dialogue context about movies and food. Therefore, MEMORY 1 provides more relevant and helpful information.\n\nChoice: 1"
