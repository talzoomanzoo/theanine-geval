There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you?\nSpeaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions?\nSpeaker B: Unfortunately I mainly play games similar to RE. I don't know why I like them so much. I remember when I was little my brother play Doom and it gave me nightmares for a week. What genre of games you like?\nSpeaker A: I like all kinds of games. I like party, fighting, RPGs, shooters, action, adventure, and puzzle games. I enjoy playing Jurassic Park: World but I'd like to find another game to play. The storm means I'll be inside for a bit, so I think I'll curl up with some pizza and just zone out. Do you like to do anything else besides game when it's rainy?\nSpeaker B: Well, I might help around the house with cleaning or laundry, but not that much. Mostly gaming. If I feel I sat too long, I'll switch to Nintendo Switch's Ring Fit Adventure to get my body moving a bit. Do yo know that game?\nSpeaker A: I've heard of it. I think I need to get some exercise, so that might be a good idea. I'd like to stay in shape as much as I can. I guess games are the best way to do that! That's a good suggestion. How about you? Do you only like games like RE? What other genres do you like?\nSpeaker B: I like fighting too, but not RPG types. I tried racing games before, but clearly not good at it so I'm not enjoying them that much. \nSpeaker A: Maybe when you get the chance, we should play an online game together. I'm not a competitive person. I mainly play games for fun and I don't care if I win or lose. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: Sure! Do you have any suggestion for the game? I also not that competitive, which probably is the reason why I don't enjoy RPG types that much with all their groups and clans and ranks. I always thought RPG players are all these serious gamers.\nSpeaker A: Maybe we can a play fighting game like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat. It's a good way to pass the time. I've always wanted to learn martial arts myself.

What is Resident Evil VIII about?   ### Speaker B: It's a horror game.  You're a guy looking for his kidnapped daughter and you have to explore a bunch of eerie locations full of monsters.  I really liked the last one so I'm eager to see if this one is as good. ### Speaker A: Hmm, that could be interesting.  Do you play by yourself or is it a multiplayer online game? ### Speaker B: I just play it by myself.  I turn the lights out and play it late at night by myself so it's as scary as possible.  Do you like horror movies and scary things like that? ### Speaker A: Not really. About the only thing scary that I like is sneaking up on a deer out in the wild!  I play videogames every now and then but they are usually tame, calm ones.' }(2) {'Related Topics': 'Future Plans and Gaming Session', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B arrange to meet up for a gaming session to try out different games together.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: I think I will enjoy hunting too, it seems like a very peaceful activity and a great way to enjoy nature! What are you up to the rest of the day? ### Speaker A: I managed to shoot a deer on my last hunting trip! It was a big buck. I am having some trouble with my gun though so I have to take it to get looked at before I can teach you how to hunt.  ### Speaker B: Oh, yeah. That seems like a critical park of hunting. How long do you expect it to take? ### Speaker A: Probably less than two hours. I just have to bring it to the shop and ask for some help. I heard you are interested in trying the Jurassic Park game.  ### Speaker B: I definitely am. How are you enjoying it? ### Speaker A: It's great. Very nice open world game. Only downside is that there is no multiplayer and the graphics are a bit outdated. You should come over some time and play ### Speaker B: I'd be down for that. Any time in the next couple of weeks? ### Speaker A: For sure. I'm a little busy this week so how about next week friday after work. Say 6pm? ### Speaker B: That would be great. Should we order in? Pizza? Chinese?  ### Speaker A: Pizza sound greats. Since you're trying out the jurassic park game I'll try out resident evil although it may take some bravery ### Speaker B: Well, yeah, it is definitely scary.
