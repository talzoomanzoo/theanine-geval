I always thought about getting a dog, but cats are just so much easier. I'm thinking about getting another cat sometime next month actually. ### Speaker A: I was talking to a friend three days ago, and they mentioned they are giving away kittens that their cat just gave birth to. You should give them a call, and ask to adopt one. I am sure they would be happy to give you a kitten, given how well you take care of your cat. ### Speaker B: Oh my goodness that's so exciting! Yes I'll definitely give them a call, at least just to talk about it and see whether one of the kittens would be right for me.
