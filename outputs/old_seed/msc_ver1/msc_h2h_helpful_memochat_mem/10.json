Hopefully the interest keeps up. I would love to see a painting of your pets. Have you ever done a self portrait with all of your pets?  ### Speaker B: Yes, it was the first really big one I did. It was how I realized I love to paint portraits. ### Speaker A: That sounds adorable! I don't think I have ever seen a family portrait with rats before. I have never understood how some people don't think they're cute. ### Speaker B: They are great little pets. But I did leave them out of the painting. Just the 5 dogs since the rats don't stay still. ### Speaker A: That does make a lot of sense. I can't imagine the dogs were too cooperative either. Are they all the same breed or do you have a big mix? ### Speaker B: I have a grant Dane, two German shepherds, pit bull, and a mixed we are not sure what he is. ### Speaker A: Tell me more about your dogs.

I have no real preference but maybe a pittie just because people still have negative impressions of them. ### Speaker B: Pitbulls are lovely!
