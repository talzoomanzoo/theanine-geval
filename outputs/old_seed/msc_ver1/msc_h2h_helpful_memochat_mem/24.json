They're sooo cute but you have to watch out because they can get feisty. I love my job so much. I hope you can find small things to enjoy about yours. ### Speaker B: It's very repetitive. At first, it was interesting, but now it's boring. I hope to get a promotion, so I can learn something interesting again. Haha. I'm sure working with animals is an everyday thrill. ### Speaker A: I'd gladly have you help out for a few days if I could! The excrement won't pick itself up, unfortunately. You would get to feed some penguins to make up for that though. ### Speaker B: Haha. That sounds like a lovely time. How do you get the fish smell off of your hands afterwards? ### Speaker A: You don't :### Speaker B: The only thing that gets the grease off is dish soap. Have you ever tried vinegar? I heard it neutralizes a lot of odors. ### Speaker A: How is your job going? Have you thought about doing something you find more fulfilling?  ### Speaker B: To be honest I’m at the end of my tether.... I’m out of here as soon as I have someone decent in hand! ### Speaker A: I can talk to the administration out here at the zoo to see if you'd be able to qualify for an entry level position here if you want! ### Speaker B: Omg... that would be like a dream come true... I’ll take anything at this point and trust me you won’t regret it! Truly appreciate the referral... I feel good just thinking about the possibility:) ### Speaker A: I'll send them an email later today. I can't guarantee the work will be fabulous in any manner, usually the entry level positions start out cleaning enclosures and feeding less dangerous animals. But the pay is pretty decent and usually they'll provide on the job training. If you can get into a full time position they also offer benefits and help to pay for schooling so you can progress in the field more quickly! ### Speaker B: You have no idea how grateful I am for this opportunity! I realize it will be an entry level position and what that means but at this point in my life I just needed to switch lanes and this is the perfect sign. I can’t wait to play some music for the white tiger ...' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself! ###Speaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food? ###Speaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it.
