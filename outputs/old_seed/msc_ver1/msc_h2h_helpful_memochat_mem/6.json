Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'experience in practice', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker B talks about their training and experience in their therapy practice.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: I had to train for a while with other people before I was fully certified and licensed, but I've now been working in my own practice for about six years.  It's going alright.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? ###Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job! ###Speaker A: That sounds really great.

Speaker B is concerned about the cost of owning horses, including medical fees and expenses like horse shoes, and is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n\nSpeaker A is involved in horse breeding and taking care of horses, working at a stable and enjoying being around horses. Speaker A mentions that horses often hurt themselves while exercising, leading to potential medical costs.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: In the Dialogue Context, Speaker A asks Speaker B if they still enjoy being a therapist and comments on the difficulty of listening to people and saying the right thing. Memory 1 provides information about Speaker B's training and experience in their therapy practice, which is directly relevant as it highlights Speaker B's background and ongoing experience in the field. This would allow Speaker B to respond thoughtfully about their professional journey and current feelings about the job. Memory 2, on the other hand, introduces topics unrelated to the current dialogue, such as Speaker B's mother being a nurse, the cost of horse maintenance, and Freudian theories, none of which are pertinent to Speaker A's question about enjoying therapy work.\n\nChoice: 1"
