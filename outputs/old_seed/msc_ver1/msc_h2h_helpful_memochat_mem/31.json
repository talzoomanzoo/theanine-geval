It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \nSpeaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on?\nSpeaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study?\nSpeaker B: Ah, English should be easier than History. Sure, I can help you. What do you need to do exactly? Write an essay?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, we have to write an essay and we have a spelling component towards the end of the exam, I sure could use a little help! \n\nMEMORY 1:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Studying and Exams', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B talk about their studies, exams, and grades.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: No, definitely not.  Maybe you can make it out to one of my games sometime? ### Speaker B: I would love that. Hopefully I can make it this weekend. I have an exam on Friday and then hopefully I can make it there before your game. ### Speaker A: Which exam?  I had a history test last week and it was horrible.  I wish my teacher was better, or at least made the topic interesting.  It's so boring in his class that I have a hard time paying attention. ### Speaker B: It is for my sport medicine. It is the last one of the class I have made A's all year so hopefully I can pass this one also and I'll be done. ### Speaker A: Oh nice!  I wish that I could get all A's.  I'm more of a B and occasional C student.  The only guaranteed A I have is in gym, haha ### Speaker B: I think everyone gets an A in gym. I have studied really hard to get those As I want to pass with good grades. I figure it would help me get a good job afterwards. ### Speaker A: I'm sure it will.  My sister got good grades in school and ended up with a great teaching job.  I know it's not the same, but it definitely helped her.  I still am hoping that I can get a soccer scholarship, because there's no way that I'll get one for my academics. ### Speaker B: Just keep at it and try your hardest. You never know you might surprise yourself' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? ###Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season.
