    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 mentions that Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey, which is relevant to the conversation about Journey getting into food. However, Memory 2 provides additional context by explaining that Speaker A's pet raccoon enjoys eating pizza, which directly relates to the dialogue context of Journey eating a piece of pizza. This specific information about Journey's eating habits is more helpful for Speaker B to understand the situation and respond appropriately. Both memories mention that Speaker A has dogs and a raccoon, but Memory 2 ties it more directly to the context of Journey eating pizza.\n\nChoice: 2"
