    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses on Speaker A wanting to try martial arts with Speaker B recommending Karate and inviting Speaker A to their dojo. Information about Speaker B's karate background, scheduling availability, and their willingness to introduce Speaker A to Karate is most relevant and useful for responding to the context.\n\nMEMORY 1 provides a clear focus on Speaker B's experience with Karate, their belt level, and a bit about Speaker B's activities and interests, which can be useful in informing Speaker A about Speaker B's experience level and other activities they are involved in.\n\nMEMORY 2 does contain relevant information about Speaker B practicing Karate and having a green belt too, but it is far more extensive, including lots of unrelated information about career aspirations and skin care routines, making it much harder to separate the helpful details from the noise.\n\nChoice: 1"
