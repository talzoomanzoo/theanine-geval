    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends?\nSpeaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do.\nSpeaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars.\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I think they go dark for a couple months and then have daylight for a couple months! I actually like night time, but having daylight all the time will make me crazy lol. Yeah I kind of hope it's dark for the camping but it will be very cold. I have heard Alaska has delicious ice cream. I want to try that while I'm there, \nSpeaker A: You'd have to get some serious blackout curtains for when it was daylight lol! You'll have to stock up on some warm essentials before heading out. You definitely don't want to get stuck in a bad situation in the cold, especially if you're alone. I bet they have great ice cream! You'll have to tell me about it when you get back! \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker A mentions the outdoor activities they plan to do in Alaska, such as hiking.\n2. Speaker A has the impression that Alaska is cold and snowy, wondering if there are ski slopes there.\n3. Speaker B is unsure about what else there is to do in Alaska besides hiking.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together.\n5. Speaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet.\n6. Speaker A mentions that Alaska has mountains and glaciers, unsure if skiing is possible there.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B are both planning an Alaskan vacation but have not planned much yet. \nSpeaker A mentions the outdoor activities they plan to do in Alaska, such as hiking, causing Speaker B to have the impression that Alaska is cold and snowy, wondering if there are ski slopes there. \nSpeaker B is involved in programming work, and Speaker A and Speaker B share a sense of humor and make each other laugh during the conversation.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories provide information about Speaker A and B planning a trip to Alaska and their initial impressions and plans. However, MEMORY 2 contains additional information regarding Speaker B's programming work and their sense of humor, though it doesn't directly relate to the conversation about the Alaskan trip. MEMORY 1 provides relevant context regarding their trip planning and Speaker A's impressions of Alaska, which aligns more with the current dialogue context discussing the trip.\n\nChoice: 1"
