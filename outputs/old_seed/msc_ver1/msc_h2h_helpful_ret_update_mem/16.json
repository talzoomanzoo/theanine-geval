    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around the new dishes at Speaker A's restaurant and Speaker A getting to try the menu items for free during their shift. MEMORY 1 includes information relevant to the context, specifically mentioning Speaker A gets two free meals per weekâ€”this directly ties into the conversation about trying the dish for free. MEMORY 2 contains too much unrelated information, and while it mentions free meals, it is cluttered with extraneous details which don't add to responding to Speaker A's query about dessert choice.\n\nChoice: 1"
