    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 consolidates the information from MEMORY 1 while also providing additional context, stating that Speaker A is a librarian and loves kids. It also mentions Speaker A is busy because of work, which is relevant to the conversation about spending time with family. Additionally, it includes more comprehensive information about Speaker B's family situation and plans about the fishing trip. This context would enable Speaker A to respond more thoughtfully to Speaker B's question about the annual fishing trip.\n\nChoice: 2"
