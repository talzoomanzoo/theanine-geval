    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n2. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n3. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n4. Speaker B is a professional in a practice, where it is illegal for them to have relationships with clients.\n5. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n6. Speaker A is married and has been for four years.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nSpeaker A is involved in horse breeding and taking care of horses, which has caused Speaker B to work in their own therapy practice for about six years. \nSpeaker B, a therapist and football fan supporting the Chiefs, mentions the ups and downs of the profession, and wants to live in the city and have a horse in the future.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is asking about Speaker B's career choice to become a therapist. The most helpful memory would provide relevant background about Speaker B's path or interest in becoming a therapist.\n\nChoice: 2\n\nMemory 2 mentions Speaker B's reflections on the ups and downs of their profession, which could be linked to why they chose the profession in the first place. This is directly relevant and useful for responding to the inquiry about how they decided to become a therapist. Memory 1 does not directly address why Speaker B chose to become a therapist, making it less helpful in this context."
