    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context focuses on Speaker B taking pet snakes to college, their living arrangements, and Speaker A's housing plans for college. MEMORY 1 provides information about Speaker B's pets and general interests, such as diving and neuroscience, which could be relevant if the conversation shifts towards their interests or plans. MEMORY 2, while also mentioning neuroscience, the pet snakes, and volunteer work, offers broader context on both speakers' recreational and academic interests, including Speaker B's personal life changes. However, neither memory directly addresses housing choices or accommodations, which is the immediate context of the conversation.\n\nChoice: tie"
