    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 2 is more relevant to the context of having clear communication and preventing misunderstandings. It shows a history of Neighbors A and B discussing personal challenges and having supportive exchanges, which can help in maintaining a clear understanding, similar to avoiding misunderstandings about property lines. In contrast, Memory 1 focuses more on shared interests like reading and workouts, which are less pertinent to the current issue of property boundaries.\n\nChoice: 2"
