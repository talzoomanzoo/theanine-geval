What did you do there?\nCo-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- Co-worker B advises Co-worker A to be more disciplined and plan ahead for their actions.

In response, Co-worker B is aware of Co-worker A's struggles with late nights out and expensive Uber rides.\n- Both co-workers show a supportive and caring attitude towards each other, with Co-worker B being supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable. Consequently, Co-worker B is aware of Co-worker A's struggles with late nights out and expensive Uber rides.\n- Co-worker A has been getting written up for being late to work, which makes Co-worker A believe their success as a leader was due to determination and strength of character.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Personal Improvement and Accomplishments', 'Related Summaries': 'Co-workers A talks about personal improvement and accomplishments with Co-workers B.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Co-workers B: I completely agree.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 discusses Co-worker A's effort to be more responsible and reliable, highlighting their struggles with late nights and work punctuality. MEMORY 2 is directly related to personal improvement and accomplishments, specifically Co-worker A's effort to be more responsible and reliable. Both memories do not directly relate to the immediate context of going to the post office. However, the overarching theme of Co-worker A trying to be more responsible and tackling tasks, such as sending off mail, could make MEMORY 2 slightly more helpful as it relates to A's personal accomplishments and improvements.\n\nChoice: 2"
