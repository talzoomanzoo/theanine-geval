    "prediction": "Explanation: \nMemory 1 contains specific details about past interactions between the co-workers that relate directly to responsibility and personal improvement, particularly emphasizing support from Co-worker B regarding Co-worker A's habits and previous struggles. This is relevant to Co-worker B's last utterance about Co-worker A getting stranded due to not being able to drive themselves home from a night out, as it directly ties into Co-worker A's need to be more reliable and responsible. Memory 2 is more general and not directly as helpful in providing context for a response to the specific situation of getting stranded.\n\nChoice: 1"
