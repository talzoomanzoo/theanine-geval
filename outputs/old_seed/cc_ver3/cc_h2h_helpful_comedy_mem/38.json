    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just got back from my trip to South America. It was amazing!\nNeighbors B: Oh really? Where did you go?\nNeighbors A: I visited Brazil and Peru. The culture and food were incredible.\nNeighbors B: That sounds awesome. I've always wanted to go to Peru to see Machu Picchu.\nNeighbors A: Yes, Machu Picchu is amazing. The view from the top is breathtaking. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbors A and B took a cooking class together last year, which led them to believe in doing nice things for others to bring the community together. This made Neighbors B agree that being organized could help them improve in their work and hobbies.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description: Neighbors A is known for their exceptional organization skills, being able to keep everything in their house well-organized and tidy. They value being organized as it helps them save time and plan strategically, as shown when they beat a kid at chess with a special move. Neighbors A is also open to sharing their knowledge and skills with others, such as teaching the special chess move to a neighborhood kid.\n\nRelationship Description: Neighbors A and Neighbors B share a close and supportive relationship, as they enjoy doing kind gestures for the neighborhood kids together, like buying candy to surprise them. They both believe in the power of kindness and community-building, and Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's organization skills.\n\nEvent Description: Neighbors A and Neighbors B took a cooking class together last year, showcasing their shared interest in learning new skills. They also encountered George at the store, where they exchanged friendly waves and decided to buy candy for the neighborhood kids. This act of kindness not only brought joy to the kids but also highlighted the bond between Neighbors A and Neighbors B.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue is centered around travel experiences, specifically a recent trip to South America and a visit to Machu Picchu in Peru. Therefore, the MEMORY that would inform helpful additional context would ideally mention travel experiences or similar types of adventures, and contains information that could help Neighbors B respond meaningfully to the conversation about traveling or South America.\n\nMEMORY 1 focuses more on a cooking class experience and community building, whereas MEMORY 2 provides additional detail about the relationship between Neighbors A and B, including their shared interests and activities, but again more related to community actions. However, MEMORY 2 has more information about Neighbors A's organizational skills which could relate indirectly to planning a trip, although it does not directly relate to the travel context.\n\nUltimately, neither MEMORY directly relates to the travel and Machu Picchu context presented in the dialogue. However, between the two, MEMORY 2 provides a somewhat broader context about shared interests and skills, which might be more useful if the conversation shifts to planning or skills sharing.\n\nChoice: 2"
