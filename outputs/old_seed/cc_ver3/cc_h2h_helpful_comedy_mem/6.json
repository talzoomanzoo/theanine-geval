    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides details regarding Classmates A's admiration for Classmates B and suggests that Classmates A wants to spend more time with Classmates B. This can contextualize why Classmates A might feel particularly upset or threatened by the idea of Classmates B having an affair, thus their reaction in the dialogue. However, it lacks specific details about their relationship or any prior events that could directly inform their current confrontation about the alleged affair.\n\nMEMORY 2, however, includes more information about Classmates A's feelings towards Classmates B, stating that they have a crush on Classmates B which adds depth to their disappointment or anger in the situation. It also mentions their shared interests and intentions to spend time together which might exacerbate Classmates A's fears of infidelity. This memory provides a clearer picture of why this conversation is particularly significant, making it more relevant to the current dialogue.\n\nChoice: 2"
