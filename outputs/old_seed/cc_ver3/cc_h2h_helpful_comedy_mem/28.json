What did you do there? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- Co-worker B advises Co-worker A to be more disciplined and plan ahead for their actions. This leads to Co-worker B being supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable. Co-worker A recently moved to a new duplex with two floors, having their bedroom on the first floor and another room on the second floor. This change indicates that Co-worker A and their ex have both moved on from the breakup.\n\n- Co-worker B is concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits, which prompts Co-worker B to be supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable. As a result, Co-worker A is open to taking things slow and potentially finding a special person.\n\n- Co-worker A has been getting written up for being late to work, which is a reaction to Co-worker A going through a painful breakup and finding it hard to trust people.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nCo-workers B is a responsible and reliable individual who values discipline and punctuality. They have shown support for their co-worker's success and offered advice in difficult situations. Co-workers B is empathetic and caring, providing guidance and reassurance to others.\n\nRelationship Description:\nThe relationship between Co-workers B and Co-workers A is built on mutual support and encouragement. Co-workers B has offered advice and reassurance during challenging times, showing a strong bond of friendship and trust.\n\nEvent Description:\nCo-workers B advised Co-workers A to start showing up on time, which Co-workers A acknowledged and agreed to be more disciplined. Co-workers B also warned Co-workers A about the risks of drinking and driving, to which Co-workers A agreed to plan ahead next time. They have expressed support for each other's success and have provided guidance in personal matters, such as a painful breakup experienced by Co-workers A.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Based on Co-worker A's mention of visiting the post office, a relevant memory should ideally provide context or background that can help Co-worker B respond appropriately to what Co-worker A might discuss about the post office visit. Memory 1 contains specific details about Co-worker A's recent life experiences, such as moving and dealing with personal challenges, which could potentially be more related to why Co-worker A might be visiting the post office (e.g., forwarding mail, sending something related to their move or breakup). Memory 2 provides a more general overview of the relationship and responsibilities but lacks specific context helpful for discussing the visit to the post office.\n\nChoice: 1"
