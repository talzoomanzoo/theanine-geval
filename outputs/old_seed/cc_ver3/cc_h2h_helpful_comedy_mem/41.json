    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Classmates A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately.\nClassmates B: Why is that?\nClassmates A: I want to be smart and I think algebra can help me think more logically and critically.\nClassmates B: That's a good goal to have. Have you noticed any improvements in your thinking since studying algebra? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Classmates A's past experience with tough competition in middle school from a fast girl motivated them to improve, causing them to struggle with feeling competitive and the need to be the best at everything. As a result, Classmates A, who has not experienced similar pains in the past, is feeling worried about the situation.\n\n2. Classmates A, who is always looking to challenge themselves and improve their skills, reacts positively to Classmates B's support and suggestion to take a step back to find a balance. This leads to Classmates B offering to take Classmates A to the hospital, but Classmates A declines, saying they will manage, as they had a muscle strain in their arm but did not go to the hospital. \n\n3. Classmates B's acknowledgment of Classmates A's determination and competitiveness prompts them to offer support and suggest that Classmates A get their arm checked out, which leads to Classmate A having a muscle strain in their arm but not going to the hospital.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nClassmates B is a mysterious individual with no specific information available about their age, birthday, gender, height, weight, zodiac sign, Chinese zodiac sign, hometown, occupation, employer, education, location, or relationship status. \n\nRelationship Description:\nIn the interactions between Classmates B and Classmates A, there is a supportive and caring dynamic displayed. Classmates B shows concern for Classmates A's well-being and offers advice and assistance when needed. \n\nEvent Description:\n1. Classmates A had a competitive spirit and beat their brother in a race, with Classmates B reminding them about the importance of the journey.\n2. When Classmates A mentioned their arm hurting, Classmates B expressed concern and suggested getting it checked out, showing a caring attitude towards their friend.\n3. Classmates A and B discussed the importance of self-care and listening to one's body, highlighting their shared focus on well-being.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 2 provides more useful context in this situation. It highlights the supportive and caring dynamic between Classmates A and B, which would be relevant to the discussion around Classmates A studying algebra and if they have noticed any improvements. This supportive relationship may indicate that Classmates B is genuinely interested in Classmates A's progress and well-being, which can help in deciding how Classmates B might respond next. Memory 1, on the other hand, contains more extraneous details that don't directly relate to algebra or support the current conversation about logical and critical thinking improvements.\n\nChoice: 2"
