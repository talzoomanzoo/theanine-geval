    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides more detailed and relevant context for Classmates A's initial statement about needing to talk about something important. It highlights their strong bond and the mutual admiration they have for each other, which could imply that Classmates A feels comfortable bringing up significant matters with Classmates B. Additionally, it touches on their shared interest in science, which might be relevant to their upcoming discussion.\n\nMEMORY 2, while helpful in providing a general overview of the relationship and shared interests, does not offer as much detail about the nature of their bond or the depth of their interactions. It mentions a shared interest in attending a Lady Gaga concert, but this is less likely to be directly relevant to \"something important\" compared to the broader context of their shared academic interests and supportive relationship.\n\nChoice: 1"
