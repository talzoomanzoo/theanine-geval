    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is primarily about Classmates A getting caught cheating on their taxes, but it shifts to a discussion about Classmates A's dream of becoming a professional basketball player. Classmates B is trying to understand the connection between the two issues. Therefore, a helpful memory should include information related to Classmates A's pursuit of basketball and any relevant connection or support offered by Classmates B.\n\nMemory 1 provides detailed context about Classmate A's daily efforts and how they are balancing their work and basketball dreams, which indirectly relates to their financial struggles (the reason for cheating on taxes). It also emphasizes the supportive relationship with Classmate B regarding goals, which could help explain Classmate A's mindset or situation further.\n\nMemory 2 covers similar points but doesn't provide as much depth about Classmates A's routine or financial situation that could help explain their decision to cheat. It does mention Classmate B being supportive, but lacks some of the daily life context that Memory 1 offers.\n\nChoice: 1"
