I don't want you to get overwhelmed. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- Co-worker A is considering seeing a doctor to ensure everything is okay and Co-worker B is supportive and glad that Co-worker A is okay. Co-worker B was surprised to learn about Co-worker A's past struggles.\n- Co-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A, and Co-worker A is grateful to Co-worker B for letting them borrow the horse and is having a great time riding her. This act changed Co-worker B to be glad to have been able to help Co-worker A and feel the trade worked out well for both of them. Co-worker B is also impressed with Co-worker A's well-thought-out plans for their partnership.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A.\n2. Co-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to prioritize their health.\n3. Co-worker A values their health to continue working at their best.\n4. Both co-workers are looking forward to starting their partnership and are open to seeking extra help if needed.\n5. Co-worker A feels motivated about the future and is excited to work with Co-worker B.\n6. Co-worker B agrees that their skill sets complement each other well.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is about Co-worker A offering help to Co-worker B with their workload. Memory 2 is more relevant as it directly mentions Co-worker B offering help and support to Co-worker A, as well as their willingness to seek extra help if needed. This information aligns with the supportive and collaborative nature of the current conversation. Memory 1, on the other hand, contains many unrelated details about a past situation and shared interests that are not directly useful to the matter at hand in the dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 2"
