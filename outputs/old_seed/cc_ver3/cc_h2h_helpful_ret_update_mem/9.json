It's a very fulfilling job.\nClassmates B: That's great to hear! How did you get into carpentry?\nClassmates A: My dad was a carpenter, so I grew up around it.

    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories offer insights into Classmate A's interests beyond carpentry, but neither directly addresses recent carpentry projects. MEMORY 1 mentions Classmate A's enjoyment of carpentry and their early exposure to it through their dad, which is more relevant to Classmate B's query about big projects. However, MEMORY 1 also contains unrelated details that are not directly relevant to the carpentry subject. MEMORY 2 focuses more on business ventures, which adds background but doesn't directly address the immediate question about big carpentry projects.\n\nChoice: 1"
