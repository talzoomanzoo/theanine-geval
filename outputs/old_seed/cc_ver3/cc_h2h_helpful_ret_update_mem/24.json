I sang a solo at church this past weekend!\nCo-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while.\nCo-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing?\nCo-workers A: I sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites.\nCo-workers B: That's such a beautiful song. You have a great voice.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! It was really nerve-wracking, but I'm glad I did it.\nCo-workers B: I'm sure the audience loved it. You've really got some talent.\nCo-workers A: Thanks again. It's just something I do for fun, but it's nice to know people enjoy it.\nCo-workers B: Definitely. It's great to have a hobby like that. Reminds me of when you uncovered that mystery a while back. You always seem to surprise us with your skills.\nCo-workers A: Haha, yeah. I do like a good challenge. Speaking of surprises, remember when I found out you were married? That was a shocker.\nCo-workers B: Oh gosh, yes. I forget sometimes that not everyone knows. But yeah, I've been married for a few years now.\nCo-workers A: Crazy how time flies. Like when we found out Ms. Singh was leaving our school. I still can't believe that was two years ago.\nCo-workers B: I know, right? She was such a great teacher. Speaking of which, have you heard anything about her lately? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Co-worker B mentions that their store is getting new inventory next week, specifically a new line of athletic wear. This is hindered by Co-worker A discovering that an employee was hiding clothes to sell on the side, which led to a discussion about uncovering secrets like when Co-worker A found out Co-worker B was married.\n\n2.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context ends with a question about Ms. Singh, but prior parts of the conversation touch on surprises and discovering unexpected information, particularly related to Co-worker A's skill in uncovering secrets, like Co-worker B's marriage. Memory 1 provides specific instances related to Co-worker A's detective skills which directly relates to the part of the conversation about finding out Co-worker B's marital status as a surprise. Memory 2 also discusses Co-worker A's observant nature and history of uncovering Co-worker B's marriage, which similarly relates to the dialogue context. However, Memory 2 also contains additional relevant information about sharing memories which could be useful in providing a context on discovering things about one another over time, which can circle back to the original question about Ms. Singh. Therefore, Memory 2 contains a more concise and relevant variety of helpful information.\n\nChoice: 2"
