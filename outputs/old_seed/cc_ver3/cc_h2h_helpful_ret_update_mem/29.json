    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue is about Co-worker A going to the post office to send a package, which was a bit of a hassle. The relevant information to help Co-worker B respond should include context about Co-worker A's life that may impact their ability to handle tasks like running errands efficiently. MEMORY 2 contains specific points about Co-worker A's efforts to be more responsible, avoid late nights, and manage expenses, which can be used as a basis for understanding or relating to Co-worker A's experience at the post office. On the other hand, while MEMORY 1 provides a similar context, MEMORY 2 is more detailed and focused on Co-worker A's attempt to be more disciplined, which would be helpful for Co-worker B to respond appropriately to Co-worker A's mention of the hassle at the post office.\n\nChoice: 2"
