    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, how's it going?\nNeighbors B: Not bad, thanks. How about you?\nNeighbors A: Oh, I'm doing alright. I was just thinking about the old days when I had my rock band.\nNeighbors B: Really? You had a band?\nNeighbors A: Yeah, we were called \"The Neighbors A Band.\" We used to play live shows around the city. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbor A has been dealing with back pain for a few months but sought help from a chiropractor, avoiding surgery. This made Neighbor A look forward to playing with Neighbor B again when feeling better. Consequently, Neighbor A recently moved to London from their current location, where they had to learn how to manage stress.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbors A appreciated the support and friendship of Neighbors B.\n2. Neighbors B is familiar with Neighbors A's dog and looking forward to playing with it again.\n3. Neighbors B expresses concern for Neighbors A's back pain.\n4. Neighbors A is enjoying the different culture and exploring the city.\n5. Neighbor B is interested in chiropractic care after hearing about Neighbor A's positive experience.\n6. Neighbors A packed up their belongings and moved into a small apartment in London.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The conversation between Neighbors A and B is about Neighbors A's past experience with a rock band. There is no direct link to memories about back pain or relocation. The focus is on past band experiences and possibly shared history of music. However, MEMORY 1 mentions a desire for Neighbor A to play again, but it interweaves unrelated information that could be distracting. MEMORY 2, while also containing some unrelated points, emphasizes the supportive relationship and neighborly interactions, which could facilitate further discussion or reminiscence about the band, making it more contextually adaptable.\n\nChoice: 2"
