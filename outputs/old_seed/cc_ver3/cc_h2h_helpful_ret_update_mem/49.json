    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Wife to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I'm feeling stuck with my writing. I've been searching everywhere for new ideas, but nothing seems to work.\nWife: Have you tried brainstorming with me? Sometimes bouncing ideas off of someone else can help.\nHusband: I have, but I don't want to bother you too much with my writing stuff.\nWife: Nonsense! You can always come to me with anything. Plus, I enjoy helping you with your creative process. Have you also tried revisiting some of the writing prompts we did in our creative writing class?\nHusband: I have, but I feel like I'm just repeating the same stories over and over again.\nWife: Maybe it's time to take a step back and try something new. Have you ever tried writing in a different genre or experimenting with different styles?\nHusband: That's a good idea. I guess I just haven't had the courage to step out of my comfort zone.\nWife: Remember when you faced your fear of public speaking during your fifth-grade presentation? You can do this too. Sometimes, the biggest breakthroughs come from taking risks.\nHusband: You're right. Maybe it's time to try something completely different and see where it takes me. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nThe wife reassures the husband that it's okay to be different and encourages him to embrace who he is. She is knowledgeable about movies and is willing to share her passion with the husband. Both the husband and wife express a desire for happiness and understanding in the situation.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. The wife reassures the husband that it's okay to be different and encourages him to embrace who he is.\n2. Wife suggests that husband should try using more modern language to be better understood.\n3. Husband agrees to try adapting to modern language for better communication with his wife.\n4. The wife remembers the husband being nervous before the presentation.\n5. The wife compares the situation to when the husband fell asleep during a movie she recommended, indicating past issues in their relationship.\n6. Wife brings up Sarah, the husband's previous partner, but husband says he hasn't thought about her much.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue is focused on the husband's challenges with writing and the wife's suggestions and encouragement for him to try new things, like different genres or styles. Memory 2 is more helpful as it includes a specific reference to the wife's recollection of the husband being nervous before a presentation, which connects directly to the dialogue context where the wife encourages him to take risks in his writing, comparing it to overcoming his past fear of public speaking. Memory 1 lacks this detail and instead contains broad statements without relevant specifics to the current situation.\n\nChoice: 2"
