    "prediction": "Explanation: The Dialogue Context involves a conversation about hot sauce and its spiciness. The criterion for helpfulness is to select the MEMORY that provides information useful and relevant for the Student to respond appropriately to the Teacher's inquiry about enjoying the sensation of hot sauce. Both memories contain content about the relationship and personal events between the student and teacher, which are not directly relevant to the current conversation about hot sauce and spiciness. However, Memory 2 contains additional information that the teacher speaks Spanish and French fluently, which might indirectly play a role if discussing spicier foods common in Spanish or French culture. Yet, this specific detail doesn't directly help in responding to the question about hot sauce enjoyment.\n\nChoice: tie"
