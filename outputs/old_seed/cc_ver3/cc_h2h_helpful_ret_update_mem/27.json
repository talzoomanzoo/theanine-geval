MEMORY 2 contains relevant points about mutual support and offers to help each other, as well as Neighbor A feeling overwhelmed and stressed, which could be related to their desire for clarity and avoiding misunderstandings. These elements provide more context for Neighbors B to offer support or understanding regarding Neighbor A's need for clear boundaries.
