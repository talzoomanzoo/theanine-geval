    "prediction": "Explanation: In the Dialogue Context, Classmate A is expressing a personal and potentially emotional sentiment towards Classmate B (\"I just can't stop thinking about you.\"). To respond appropriately, it would be helpful for Classmate B to know more about the nature of their relationship, any past emotional experiences shared, and the levels of trust and support between them. Memory 1 provides detailed insights into the supportive dynamics between the classmates, mentioning Classmate A's appreciation of Classmate B's support (point 2) and touching on a prior moment of admiration for Classmate B's courage (point 1). Meanwhile, Memory 2 is more fragmented but does mention that the two have a close relationship and a level of trust (point 4), and there is mutual support (point 6). Both provide relevant context, but Memory 1 gives a clearer picture of the emotional background and interaction history which is critical for a sensitive and thoughtful response.\n\nChoice: 1"
