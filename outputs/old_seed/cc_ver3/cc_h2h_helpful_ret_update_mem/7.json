    "prediction": "Explanation: The conversation in the Dialogue Context is about Classmate A wanting to work on a project with Classmate B and potentially become business partners. This indicates a shift towards a professional or entrepreneurial interest. MEMORY 2 captures elements of encouragement and admiration, which are relevant as B could respond supportively to A's business proposal. On the other hand, MEMORY 1 includes more non-relevant details about socializing, buying coffee, and relaxation methods, which don't directly correspond to the project proposal and potential business partnership discussed in the Dialogue Context.\n\nChoice: 2"
