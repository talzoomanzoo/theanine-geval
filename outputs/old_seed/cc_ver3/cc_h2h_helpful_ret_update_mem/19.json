    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 is more helpful because it directly references the breathing exercise mentioned in the dialogue context, which shows a connection between the exercise and the improvement in their relationship. This memory highlights a positive, shared experience related to the exercise, providing context for a meaningful and relevant response. In contrast, MEMORY 2 lacks direct reference to the breathing exercise, making it less relevant to the current context.\n\nChoice: 1"
