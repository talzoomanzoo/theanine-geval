    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Athlete to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nAthlete: Ted Athlete unrolls the map. He looks at it for a few moments before tracing his finger along one of the highways. \"This is our route,\" he says finally, feeling in control.\nCoach: What route are you planning, Ted?\nAthlete: I'm thinking of taking the highway through the mountains, it's a bit longer, but the scenery is beautiful.\nCoach: That sounds like a good plan, as long as we factor in enough time for rest stops and breaks. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nThe Athlete is focused on improving their performance and energy levels. This focus has led to the Athlete taking on more responsibilities and gaining respect from other players. Both the Athlete and Coach emphasize the importance of small changes in diet impacting performance.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. The coach advises the athlete on pre-game meals, emphasizing the need for a balance of carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats, as well as staying hydrated.\n2. The Athlete is focused on helping the team succeed and has shown leadership qualities during warm-ups and stretches.\n3. The Coach reminds the Athlete that little distractions can add up and impact performance.\n4. The Athlete seeks approval and praise from the Coach.\n5. The Coach has noticed the Athlete's improvement and dedication to improving skills.\n6. The coach encourages the athlete to continue their good work with nutrition and training.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 2 provides information directly relevant to a journey or a plan that involves careful consideration of resources, such as planning meals and ensuring hydration, which can be metaphorically related to planning for rest stops and breaks on a travel route. The athlete's dedication and improvement noted by the coach, as well as the emphasis on handling distractions, can tie into the approach to a planned journey. Memory 1, while it mentions focus and improvement, is more generic in terms of overall performance and does not directly offer information that ties into planning an actual route or journey.\n\nChoice: 2"
