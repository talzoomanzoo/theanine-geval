What did you do there? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- Co-worker B advises Co-worker A to be more disciplined and plan ahead for their actions. This leads to Co-worker B being supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable. Co-worker A recently moved to a new duplex with two floors, having their bedroom on the first floor and another room on the second floor. This change indicates that Co-worker A and their ex have both moved on from the breakup.\n\n- Co-worker B is concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits, which prompts Co-worker B to be supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable. As a result, Co-worker A is open to taking things slow and potentially finding a special person.\n\n- Co-worker A has been getting written up for being late to work, which is a reaction to Co-worker A going through a painful breakup and finding it hard to trust people.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is about Co-worker A visiting the post office, and Co-worker B asking what Co-worker A did there. MEMORY 2 contains information that Co-worker A has been successful in not being late to work for weeks, which is directly relevant if Co-worker A mentions mailing something related to work or time management. Memory 1 provides more context around Co-worker A's life changes but is less directly relevant to the specifics of the post office visit.\n\nChoice: 2"
