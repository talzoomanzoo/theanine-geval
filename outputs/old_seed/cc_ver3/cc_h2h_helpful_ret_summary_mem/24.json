    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Co-workers A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend!\nCo-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while.\nCo-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing?\nCo-workers A: I sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites.\nCo-workers B: That's such a beautiful song. You have a great voice.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! It was really nerve-wracking, but I'm glad I did it.\nCo-workers B: I'm sure the audience loved it. You've really got some talent.\nCo-workers A: Thanks again. It's just something I do for fun, but it's nice to know people enjoy it.\nCo-workers B: Definitely. It's great to have a hobby like that. Reminds me of when you uncovered that mystery a while back. You always seem to surprise us with your skills.\nCo-workers A: Haha, yeah. I do like a good challenge. Speaking of surprises, remember when I found out you were married? That was a shocker.\nCo-workers B: Oh gosh, yes. I forget sometimes that not everyone knows. But yeah, I've been married for a few years now.\nCo-workers A: Crazy how time flies. Like when we found out Ms. Singh was leaving our school. I still can't believe that was two years ago.\nCo-workers B: I know, right? She was such a great teacher. Speaking of which, have you heard anything about her lately? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Co-worker B mentions that their store is getting new inventory next week, specifically a new line of athletic wear. This is hindered by Co-worker A discovering that an employee was hiding clothes to sell on the side, which led to a discussion about uncovering secrets like when Co-worker A found out Co-worker B was married.\n\n2. Co-worker A and Co-worker B both plan to treat themselves to a nice dinner with their paychecks. This leads to Co-worker A suggesting celebrating their detective work with drinks after work, reminiscing about happy memories shared while working together.\n\n3. Co-worker A and Co-worker B both plan to treat themselves to a nice dinner with their paychecks, reflecting on their detective work. This is because Co-worker A, known for their Sherlock Holmes-like skills and love for solving mysteries, observed and found out that Co-worker B is married, causing a reaction from Co-worker A.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker B was surprised when Co-worker A found out they were married.\n2. Co-worker A and Co-worker B shared happy memories from their time working together.\n3. Co-worker A is observant and did some research on social media to find out that Co-worker B is married.\n4. Co-worker A has a talent for solving puzzles and mysteries.\n5. Co-worker B is married and had a weekend where they went hiking and had dinner with friends.\n6. Co-worker A is described as having \"Sherlock Holmes-like skills\" and enjoys solving mysteries.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more helpful as it directly aligns with the dialogue context's focus on Co-worker A's skills in solving mysteries, Co-worker B's marital status, and shared memories between them. It provides specific details about Co-worker A's observant nature and Co-worker B's surprise, which is relevant to the ongoing conversation. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, includes details about an unrelated inventory situation and a non-relevant discussion about uncovering secrets, which is not as immediately applicable to the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 2"
