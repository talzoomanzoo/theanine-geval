    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more helpful because it provides a broader context including the mutual support between the neighbors, such as Neighbors B offering to help Neighbors A with an apology process. It also contains multiple elements of their interaction, like Neighbors A thanking Neighbors B and discussing buying a necklace, which aligns with the initial dialogue context about helping each other. These elements make it easier for Neighbors A to relate to the present conversation about mutual support.\n\nChoice: 2"
