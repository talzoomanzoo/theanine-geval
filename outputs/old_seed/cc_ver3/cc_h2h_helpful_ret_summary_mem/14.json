    "prediction": "Explanation: To determine which memory is more helpful, we need to consider the context of the current interaction where the Mentee is expressing gratitude for the Mentor's help in finding their glasses. While the specific subject of sobriety mentioned in both memories may not be directly relevant, the broader themes of support, gratitude, and the Mentor's willingness to help and guide are applicable to the current context.\n\nMEMORY 1 focuses more on the dynamics of support and admiration, with specific instances related to sobriety, which are less directly applicable to misplacing glasses. MEMORY 2, however, includes more direct references to ongoing support, guidance, and the Mentor's willingness to help, which aligns well with the gratitude expressed by the Mentee for the Mentor's assistance.\n\nChoice: 2"
