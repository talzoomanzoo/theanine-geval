How does it work?\nParent: Well, I create the ads myself, and then I post them on my website. People who want to view the ads can pay a small fee, and then they can see them. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. The Parent expresses a desire to be a better role model for the Child and their siblings because the Parent agrees to make an effort to start pulling their weight around the house and to follow the chore schedule. The Child is caring and offers help to the Parent.\n   \n2. The Parent acknowledges being lazy about washing dishes and promises to contribute more to keeping the home clean because the Child feels it is unfair that they have to do certain chores because the Parent is too tired.

The Parent has seen a doctor and is taking medicine for their illness.\n\n3. The Parent witnessed a terrible accident while walking to work and was deeply affected by it because the Parent is working and feels tired after a long day.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 includes details about the Parent's desire to be a better role model and contribute to household chores, which although helpful in a domestic context, is not directly relevant to the project of creating a website for advertisements. MEMORY 2 provides information that is more closely related to the Parent's work status (point 3), which may pertain to how they manage their time and energy for side projects like the website. However, neither memory provides direct information about web development or advertisement strategies.\n\nChoice: 2"
