    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Co-workers B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager!\nCo-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge.\nCo-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail.\nCo-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of new products, remember when you used to fantasize about being a great leader?\nCo-workers A: Ha, yeah. That seems like ages ago.\nCo-workers B: Well, now you can finally take on that leadership role and make your dreams a reality.\nCo-workers A: That's true. It's amazing how life works out sometimes. But it hasn't always been smooth sailing. Remember when I was really stressed about you not liking me?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, I remember. But we worked through it, didn't we?\nCo-workers A: We definitely did. And it taught me to just take things one step at a time, like I am with this new role.\nCo-workers B: Exactly, and I'm sure you'll apply that same mentality to your training as well. I remember you were really dedicated to it a couple of years ago.\nCo-workers A: Oh yeah, I still try to keep up with it whenever I can. It's important to stay physically and mentally fit, especially with this new job.\nCo-workers B: Just don't let your anger get the better of you again. Remember when you exploded and started throwing things?\nCo-workers A: Ugh, let's not even go there. My parents gave me a good scolding for that. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nCo-worker A fantasizing about being a great leader led to them emphasizing the importance of communication and aspiring to be respected and admired.\n\nCo-worker B encouraging Co-worker A to pursue a leadership position resulted in them stressing the significance of communication, conflict resolution, and taking small steps in conversations.\n\nCo-worker A's fantasies of being a great leader influenced them to prioritize getting along and working smoothly with Co-worker B, despite feeling stressed about their past relationship. This stress caused Co-worker B to advise Co-worker A on managing emotions and addressing the issue openly.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker B encourages Co-worker A to consider pursuing a leadership position and highlights the qualities of a good leader.\n2. Co-worker A used to fantasize about being a great leader and being respected and admired.\n3. Co-worker A has fantasies of being a great leader.\n4. Co-worker A has aspirations of being a great leader and emphasizes the importance of communication.\n5. Co-worker A has grown and become more confident over the years.\n6. Co-worker A considers taking on more responsibility at work as a start towards being a leader.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 is more helpful because it directly relates to the context of the conversation, highlighting Co-worker A's past stress about their relationship with Co-worker B and the need to address emotions and communication proactively. This is relevant to the dialogue, where they discuss past challenges and how Co-worker A is applying lessons learned to their new role. MEMORY 2, while providing a general history of Co-worker A's leadership aspirations, lacks specific connection to the current dialogue context regarding stress management and their relationship with Co-worker B.\n\nChoice: 1"
