It's always so crowded.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it was pretty busy today. But I needed to get this package sent out.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of packages, remember that time when you got stranded because you couldn't drive yourself home from a night out with friends? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- Co-worker B is supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable, as both co-workers show a supportive and caring attitude towards each other.\n- Co-worker B advises Co-worker A to be more disciplined and plan ahead for their actions, causing Co-worker B to be supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable.\n- Co-worker B is concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits, reacting to Co-worker A's struggles with late nights out and expensive Uber rides, while still wanting Co-worker A to be more responsible and avoid such situations.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker B is aware of Co-worker A's struggles with late nights out and expensive Uber rides.\n2. Co-worker A is trying to be more responsible but still working on avoiding late nights out and expensive rides.\n3. Co-worker B is concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits.\n4.

    "prediction": "Explanation: In the dialogue, Co-worker B mentions a specific past situation where Co-worker A got stranded due to an inability to drive home after a night out, which relates to drinking and transportation issues. Memory 2 explicitly matches this context by detailing Co-worker A's struggles with late nights, drinking, and transportation, and it provides relevant information about Co-worker A's efforts to improve their punctuality and drinking habits, which Co-worker B seems to reference. Memory 1, while discussing similar themes, does not provide as much specific detail about avoiding expensive Uber rides and being late to work.\n\nChoice: 2"
