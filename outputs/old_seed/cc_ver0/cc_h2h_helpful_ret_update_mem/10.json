    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses on Classmates A and B discussing starting a marketing agency and becoming business partners, which implies a professional and ambitious context. MEMORY 1 contains general social activities and advice for working through feelings, which is less relevant. MEMORY 2, while still focusing on social aspects, contains an additional point about Classmate B admiring Classmate A's outgoing nature. This admiration and desire could be indirectly related to embarking on a business venture together, as outgoing and confident traits can be valuable in such a project. However, neither memory provides substantial support related to the specific business context of starting an agency, making them equally less helpful. \n\nChoice: tie"
