    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit.\nNeighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water.\nNeighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it.\nNeighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbors A and B started off not knowing each other well but wanting to spend more time together. As time passed, they became good friends and enjoy reminiscing about past events. Neighbors B, who is supportive, suggests making something together and shows consideration by suggesting having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\n2. Neighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A.\n3. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n4. Neighbors A and B have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside.\n5. Both Neighbors A and B enjoy spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn.\n6. Neighbor A's mom scolds them for ripping off the tag from their new shirt.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The MEMORY that captures more relevant and useful information about the relationship and dynamics between Neighbors A and B would be the most helpful. Given the context of a disagreement about pushing into cold water as a joke, it is useful to understand if there is a pattern or past behavior that influences their interaction.\n\nMEMORY 1 provides information about the progression of Neighbors A and B's relationship, how they became good friends over time, and their supportive interactions. This context is relevant to the dialogue as it shows that despite their good friendship, there are boundaries and actions that can cause friction, such as the incident discussed.\n\nMEMORY 2 contains more details and breadth of interactions and topics, including considerations for comfort like water on hot days and their outdoor activities. However, it does not as directly address the history or dynamic that would clarify the handling of jokes or pranks between themâ€”key to the current dialogue.\n\nChoice: 1"
