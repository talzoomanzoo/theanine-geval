    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 2 contains information about Classmates A attending a seminar on starting a business, which could relate to how they got into carpentry, making it somewhat relevant to the conversation context. Additionally, it includes details about Classmate B's supportive nature, which might provide context for B's encouragement. Although the information about singing is less relevant, the focus on entrepreneurship and support is useful. Memory 1, however, includes additional unrelated information about Classmate A's appreciation for the President and lacks specific mentions that could directly tie into how Classmate A got into carpentry.\n\nChoice: 2"
