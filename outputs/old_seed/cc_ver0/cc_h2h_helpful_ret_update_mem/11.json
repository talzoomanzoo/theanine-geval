    "prediction": "Explanation: When evaluating the relevance and usefulness of the MEMORIES in relation to the current context, it is important to focus on information that can support Classmate A and Classmate B's immediate conversation about starting a marketing agency. MEMORY 1 highlights a bond through social activities and shared intention of taking steps towards a better future, which is aligned with the positive collaboration context in the dialogue. MEMORY 2 also mentions shared activities and a positive outlook, which could be relevant, but it is presented as a list without direct ties to the project's context. Overall, MEMORY 1 provides a more coherent backstory that enriches the understanding of their teamwork potential and why they might make good business partners. \n\nChoice: 1"
