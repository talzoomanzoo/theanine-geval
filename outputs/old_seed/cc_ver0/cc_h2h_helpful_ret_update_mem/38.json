    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Husband to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together.

Where do you want to go?\nHusband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city.\nWife: Oh, that sounds like a perfect idea! It will be nice to have some peace and quiet for a change.\nHusband: Yes, and we could cook our meals together, go for a hike, and just relax. What do you think?\nWife: That sounds lovely, husband. I'm really looking forward to it. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nThe husband is excited about his progress on long-awaited plans and is putting in a lot of effort to make them a reality. This excites him and makes him want to commit even more to his plans. The husband and wife are committed to each other and excited about their future together. \n\nThey discussed setting specific times for updates on progress and waiting for each other for certain events to avoid similar situations. This discussion was caused by the husband's long-awaited plans and his action towards them.\n\nThe wife supports the husband's goals but wanted to be involved in them. This support from the wife makes both the husband and wife supportive of each other's dreams and aspirations.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. The husband is excited about his progress on long-awaited plans and is putting in a lot of effort to make them a reality.\n2. The husband is inspired by his wife to take action on his dreams and goals.\n3. The husband apologized and promised to involve the wife in his plans in the future.\n4. The husband and wife are committed to each other and excited about their future together.\n5. The husband values the wife's encouragement and positivity in his pursuit of his goals.\n6. The wife is supportive and proud of her husband for working towards his goals.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: In the dialogue context, the husband is proposing a plan for a weekend getaway, and the wife is expressing enthusiasm and support for the idea. The memory should provide context that allows the husband to respond appropriately to this exchange. MEMORY 2 includes the husband's appreciation for the wife's encouragement and positivity, which aligns well with the ongoing discussion about shared plans and enjoyment of each other's company. It also explicitly mentions that the husband values the wife's involvement in his plans, which is relevant given they are planning a getaway together. MEMORY 1, while similar, does not specifically emphasize the husband's appreciation or the wife's encouragement in the same explicit manner as MEMORY 2, making MEMORY 2 slightly more helpful for this specific context.\n\nChoice: 2"
