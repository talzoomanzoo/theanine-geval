Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nCo-worker B showed a willingness to assist others by helping a customer resolve an issue last week.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains more context and relevant information for Co-workers B's role in guiding and advising Co-workers A. It mentions Co-worker B's supportive nature, their tendency to reassure Co-worker A, and a specific incident where similar emotions (guilt) were involved. This aligns well with the conversation where Co-worker B needs to correct Co-worker A's mindset using understanding and empathy.\n\nChoice: 1"
