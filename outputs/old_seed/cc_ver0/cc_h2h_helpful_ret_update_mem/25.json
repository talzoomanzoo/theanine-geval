I'm a millionaire now!\nNeighbors B: Wow, that's incredible! How did it happen?\nNeighbors A: I inherited it from a distant relative. It's still sinking in, to be honest.\nNeighbors B: That's amazing, congratulations!

After that, I think I'll take a nice long vacation and maybe donate some to charity.\nNeighbors B: That's very generous of you. Have you thought about investing any of it?\nNeighbors A: Yes, actually. I've been doing some research and I think I want to invest in some stocks and maybe even start my own business.\nNeighbors B: That sounds like a great idea. You have the opportunity to do so much with your newfound wealth.\nNeighbors A: Definitely. It's funny how things can change so quickly. Just a few years ago, I was stuck in a job I hated and now I have all this freedom.\nNeighbors B: Speaking of jobs, have you thought about what you want to do now? You don't really have to work if you don't want to.\nNeighbors A: I know, but I don't think I could ever completely give up working. Plus, I have some ideas for businesses that I want to pursue.

You're definitely one of the most driven people I know. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbors A made a big career change recently and is much happier now.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is about Neighbors A becoming a millionaire and considering what to do next with their life, including plans for a business and a discussion about career goals. Memory 1 is more concise and focused on the relevant past career change and motivation for growth, which ties into Neighbors A's current situation. Memory 2, while detailed, includes information about needing to update a resume and looking for opportunities, which is less relevant as Neighbors A is now considering starting their own business and is no longer financially required to seek a job. The more focused approach of Memory 1 makes it more useful in the context of a conversation about future plans and ambitions now that they are a millionaire.\n\nChoice: 1"
