    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Wife to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I'm feeling stuck with my writing. I've been searching everywhere for new ideas, but nothing seems to work.\nWife: Have you tried brainstorming with me? Sometimes bouncing ideas off of someone else can help.\nHusband: I have, but I don't want to bother you too much with my writing stuff.\nWife: Nonsense! You can always come to me with anything. Plus, I enjoy helping you with your creative process. Have you also tried revisiting some of the writing prompts we did in our creative writing class?\nHusband: I have, but I feel like I'm just repeating the same stories over and over again.\nWife: Maybe it's time to take a step back and try something new. Have you ever tried writing in a different genre or experimenting with different styles?\nHusband: That's a good idea. I guess I just haven't had the courage to step out of my comfort zone. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nThe husband and wife both express a desire for happiness and understanding in the situation, showing a willingness to support each other. The wife reassures the husband that it's okay to be different and encourages him to embrace who he is. The husband agrees to try adapting to modern language for better communication with his wife. The husband, who gave a fifth-grade presentation in the past, is open to learning more about movies and trying again.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Wife suggests that husband should try using more modern language to be better understood.\n2. The wife reassures the husband that it's okay to be different and encourages him to embrace who he is.\n3. Wife brings up Sarah, the husband's previous partner, but husband says he hasn't thought about her much.\n4. Husband agrees to try adapting to modern language for better communication with his wife.\n5. The wife compares the situation to when the husband fell asleep during a movie she recommended, indicating past issues in their relationship.\n6. The wife remembers the husband being nervous before the presentation.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories mention the wife supporting the husband and encouraging him to embrace who he is, which is relevant to the encouragement she is offering in the current conversation. However, Memory 1 is more focused on the positive aspects of their interactions and the husband's openness to trying new things, which aligns more closely with the current dialogue where the wife is suggesting trying new writing styles. Memory 2 includes more distracting details about past partners and issues with watching movies, which may not be as directly relevant to the writing discussion.\n\nChoice: 1"
