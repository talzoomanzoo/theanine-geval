    "prediction": "Explanation: The last utterance in the dialogue context is about whether Co-worker A has ever been in a physical altercation. Memory 1 focuses on Co-worker A's experience and determination in presenting evidence and their confidence in their arguments. Memory 2, on the other hand, does not specifically address anything about physical altercations but provides additional context about Co-worker A's experience with evidence, clients, and communication. Although neither memory directly addresses physical altercations, Memory 2 contains more relevant information about Co-worker A's interaction style and communication, which could provide some insight into how Co-worker A might handle confrontations, even if not physical ones.\n\nChoice: 2"
