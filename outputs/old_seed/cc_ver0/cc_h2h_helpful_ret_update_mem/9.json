    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Classmates A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I have some exciting plans for the future that I wanted to share with you.\nClassmates B: Oh really? What are they? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- Classmate A encourages Classmate B to initiate conversations and be friendly to make new friends. This causes Classmates B to appreciate Classmates A's gesture of buying coffee. As a reaction, Classmates A agreed to try the suggestion and thanked Classmates B for it, wanting Classmates B to encourage them to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n\n- Classmate A and Classmate B enjoy singing karaoke together and look forward to future outings. They both plan to relax at home later in the day, having had trouble sleeping and trying natural remedies like chamomile tea and lavender oil.\n\n- Classmate A and Classmate B both enjoy socializing and going out to parties together. This shared interest leads Classmates A to be social and enjoy meeting new people, while also considering talking to a therapist or counselor to address past issues.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n2. Classmate A and Classmate B enjoy singing karaoke together and look forward to future outings.\n3. Classmates A is social and enjoys meeting new people.\n4. Classmates A is looking forward to meeting up with Classmates B again after getting better sleep.\n5. Classmate B admires Classmate A's outgoing nature and wants to be more like them.\n6. Classmates A and B are open to meeting for coffee again in the future.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The MEMORY that provides more relevant and useful information for the context in which Classmate A is about to share their exciting plans for the future should ideally link to their interest or aspirations. MEMORY 1 includes relevant context about Classmate A considering talking to a therapist or counselor to address past issues and their general social nature, which could be relevant to their future plans. MEMORY 2, however, presents facts that would be more directly and broadly relevant to a variety of potential future plans without specific insights into their current intentions.\n\nBoth memories provide insights into Classmate A's social interests and dynamics with Classmate B, but MEMORY 2 provides a broader overview that Classmate A is social and enjoys meeting new people, along with Classmate Bâ€™s admiration, which could signal encouragement for Classmate A's plans. The fact that they could meet for coffee again shows they maintain ongoing close social interactions that may support future plans discussion.\n\nChoice: 2"
