I've been doing it every day for the past week and it's made such a difference.\nNeighbors B: That's really interesting.

That was a stressful time for both of us.\nNeighbors A: It definitely was. But I'm so glad that we've been able to move past that and have a good neighborly relationship now.\nNeighbors B: Me too. And remember when you found that great park a few years ago?\nNeighbors A: Yes, I loved that park!

Have you been back recently? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbor A ordered a large cheese pizza with extra sauce for Neighbor B as a gesture of appreciation. This act caused Neighbor A to recently discover a park on Main Street with a playground and water park area.

This gesture of appreciation also led Neighbor B to value their friendship with Neighbor A.

    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories provide some context about Neighbors A and B's past interactions, particularly involving a park they found together, which relates to the current dialogue about visiting a park. However, MEMORY 1 directly mentions that memory of the park on Main Street, which ties more closely to the last statement in the dialogue context about being back to visit the park. MEMORY 2 provides broader information about their relationship and how Neighbor A showed appreciation for Neighbor B, but it doesn't add any additional details specifically relevant to the question of visiting the park recently.\n\nChoice: 1"
