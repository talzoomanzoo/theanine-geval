I don't want any misunderstandings in the future.\nNeighbors B: I understand.

As a result, Neighbor A offers to help Neighbor B with getting into a workout routine. In response, Neighbor B offers to be more supportive and check in on Neighbor A more often. \nNeighbor A's favorite book is \"The Great Gatsby,\" which causes Neighbor B to admire Neighbor A's career advancement and express interest in borrowing the personal development book. Neighbor B's admiration leads Neighbor A to offer help with getting into a workout routine. Both neighbors then emphasize the importance of taking care of each other as neighbors.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nNeighbors A is a secretary turned manager at a small marketing agency who recently got promoted. They strive to be more important at work and have been applying personal development principles to their job.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context centers around the clarification of property boundaries between Neighbors A and B, indicating a need for clear communication and understanding. MEMORY 2 is more helpful because it provides a background on the supportive relationship between the neighbors, which is relevant to their current communication about property boundaries. It emphasizes their mutual support and shared experiences, suggesting that they have a strong foundation for resolving issues amicably. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, focuses more on personal development and interests, which are less pertinent to the property boundary discussion.\n\nChoice: 2"
