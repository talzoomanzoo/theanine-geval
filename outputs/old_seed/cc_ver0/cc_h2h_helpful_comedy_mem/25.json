You don't really have to work if you don't want to.\nNeighbors A: I know, but I don't think I could ever completely give up working. Plus, I have some ideas for businesses that I want to pursue.

You're definitely one of the most driven people I know. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbors A made a big career change recently and is much happier now.

    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories provide background context about Neighbors A and B's relationship and previous interactions, but Memory 1 is more specific to Neighbors A's career change and the emotions involved in making that decision. Given the current dialogue about Neighbors A's newfound wealth and potential for a career change, Memory 1 is more directly relevant as it highlights the career-oriented discussion and Neighbors A's previous desire for change. \n\nChoice: 1"
