    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 does not provide much relevant information to directly address the current issue of the husband's writing challenges, whereas Memory 2 highlights the supportive nature of the wife's encouragement. This ties directly into the current context where the wife is trying to encourage the husband to explore new writing styles and genres. Furthermore, Memory 2 contains more specific details, such as the husband's tendency to use old-fashioned language and his past experiences of feeling judged, which can be connected to his fear of stepping out of his comfort zone in writing. This context is relevant to the wife's encouragement to embrace uniqueness and try something new.\n\nChoice: 2"
