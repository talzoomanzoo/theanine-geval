    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains details about the student's recent stress and excitement about retirement, which are not relevant or helpful to the current conversation about hot sauce. MEMORY 2 provides a more general background of the student and teacher's supportive relationship, which, while also not highly relevant to the topic of hot sauce, does not introduce unrelated topics. However, neither memory is particularly helpful in the context of discussing the student's love-hate relationship with spicy food. Thus, MEMORY 2 is slightly more helpful due to its focus on character traits and relationship dynamics that could be peripherally relevant.\n\nChoice: 2"
