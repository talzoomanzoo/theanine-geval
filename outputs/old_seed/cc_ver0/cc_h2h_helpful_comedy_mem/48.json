    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories suggest an overall positive and productive relationship between Neighbors A and B, which can motivate A to follow B's advice on changing their scenery for better focus. However, Memory 2 contains specific information about A's penchant for taking care of flowers and organizing community events, which could inspire Neighbors A to incorporate those interests into their study environment to increase their productivity. This makes Memory 2 more contextually relevant and potentially helpful than Memory 1.\n\nChoice: 2"
