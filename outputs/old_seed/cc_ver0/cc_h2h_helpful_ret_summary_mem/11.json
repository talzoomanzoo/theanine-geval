    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is about Classmate A and Classmate B discussing potential business collaboration, emphasizing their complementary skills (creative and analytical). Useful memories for this context would focus on their professional and collaborative dynamics or unique skill sets rather than solely social interactions. MEMORY 1 highlights supportive interactions and a gesture of buying coffee that can translate to professional appreciation and support. MEMORY 2, while highlighting mutual admiration and encouragement, focuses more on social settings and karaoke, which is less relevant to a business proposal. Therefore, MEMORY 1 is more directly useful for the professional collaboration conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
