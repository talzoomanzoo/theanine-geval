    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is about property boundaries, which is a topic more related to neighborly relationships, cooperation, and mutual support rather than individual career advancements or personal development. While neither memory directly addresses property or boundary issues, MEMORY 2 contains broader contextual information about their relationship, including mutual support and offers to help, which could lead to more relevant and supportive dialogue about resolving boundary issues.\n\nChoice: 2"
