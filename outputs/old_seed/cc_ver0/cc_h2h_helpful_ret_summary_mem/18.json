    "prediction": "Explanation: The MENTEE's recollection of substance abuse and the impact it had on their life is a key topic in the dialogue context. MEMORY 2 provides a direct and comprehensive summary of the Mentee's experiences, crediting the Mentor and outlining the Mentee's history of substance abuse, their sobriety journey, and the changes they have made. It covers the background information on the Mentee's struggles and the Mentor's support, making it highly relevant and useful for the Mentor to respond in context. MEMORY 1, while similar, introduces less pertinent details such as yoga and lacks the comprehensive overview that MEMORY 2 provides.\n\nChoice: 2"
