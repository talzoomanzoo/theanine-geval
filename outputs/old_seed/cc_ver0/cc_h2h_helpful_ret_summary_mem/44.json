    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about Classmates A being concerned that Classmates B knows something about their past that even their closest friends don't know. Classmates A is seeking reassurance about privacy and trust. Therefore, a MEMORY that discusses trust, past interactions, friendship, or related personal dynamics would be most helpful. MEMORY 1 mentions Classmates B being well-liked and emphasizing positivity, which could be relevant to building trust. In both memories, Classmates B appreciates the friendship and exhibits an optimistic approach after the conversation, but MEMORY 2 explicitly mentions the friendship and positive attitude of Classmates A, which directly aligns with the dialogue's concern about trust and assurance about confidentiality.\n\nChoice: 2"
