    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey, can you keep a secret?\nNeighbors B: Of course, what's up?\nNeighbors A: I can't be seen because I am hiding from my mom behind the door.\nNeighbors B: Oh, why are you hiding from her?\nNeighbors A: She wants me to go to a family dinner tonight, but I'm too tired and just want to relax at home.\nNeighbors B: Maybe you should talk to her about it and let her know how you feel.\nNeighbors A: I know, but I don't want to disappoint her.\nNeighbors B: It's important to take care of your own needs and speak up for yourself. Plus, maybe you can compromise and go to the dinner for a little while and then come back home to relax.\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, thanks for the advice.\nNeighbors B: No problem. Speaking of compromise, remember that dinner we went to a few days ago? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbors B is interested in Neighbors A's cooking and asks about the vegetables and quinoa preparation. Neighbors A mentions the practical uses of telekinesis, like grabbing things from a distance, which causes Neighbors A to gain the ability to move objects with their mind. \nNeighbors B is open to trying new recipes and is excited to receive the chickpea curry recipe from Neighbors A. This leads to Neighbors A and B joking about the fun aspects of using telekinesis to surprise people, causing Neighbors A to feel overwhelmed but also excited about their new ability.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbor B offers support and suggests planning a dinner to celebrate Neighbor A's new adventures in learning.\n2.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around Neighbors A seeking advice about hiding to avoid a family dinner and ends with a mention of a past dinner, indicating a shared experience or memory. MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 both contain elements of interest in cooking and shared meals but MEMORY 2 includes specific points that highlight Neighbors B's supportive nature, enjoyment of Neighbors Aâ€™s cooking, and enjoyment of trying new things. These elements are more closely tied to the context of compromising and discussing a shared meal, making it potentially more helpful for engaging in further conversation about dinners and support.\n\nChoice: 2"
