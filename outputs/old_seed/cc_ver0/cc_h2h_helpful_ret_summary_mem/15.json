    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 focuses more on the professional relationship and communication between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, which is directly relevant to the context of their discussion on differing perspectives and contributions to the team. It emphasizes the importance of valuing communication and understanding, which aligns well with the dialogue context where Co-worker B is highlighting the need for considering different ideas. MEMORY 1 contains personal details like giving massages, which are less relevant to the professional context of their dialogue about leadership and teamwork dynamics.\n\nChoice: 2"
