    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is about a student discussing their mixed feelings about consuming hot sauce. Neither memory directly relates to hot sauce or food preferences; however, Memory 2 does include brief notes on the student experiencing stress, which might relate to their feelings of tolerance toward the hot sauce's intensity. The memories mostly focus on unrelated topics, such as stress management and apologies, which are not immediately relevant, but Memory 2 is slightly more useful because it is concise and better organized, allowing the teacher to draw on the positive relationship aspect as a way to discuss the student's enjoyment of spicy food in a supportive manner.\n\nChoice: 2"
