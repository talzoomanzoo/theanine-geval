    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context focuses on the husband wanting to organize a weekend getaway with his wife, emphasizing spending quality time, relaxation, and involving the wife in activities like cooking and hiking. The helpful memory should relate specifically to the couple's dynamic in collaboration, plans, and mutual involvement. \n\nMemory 1 highlights the husband's excitement about achieving plans and the couple's commitment to each other's dreams, showing how they plan to support and update each other.

However, both memories are similarly helpful, outlining their relationship dynamics and the commitment to shared experiences.\n\nChoice: tie"
