    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context suggests that Classmate B is feeling frustrated and doesn't want to be a burden. Memory 1 highlights that Classmates A and B have a supportive relationship and enjoy collaborating on music, which could be relevant for offering support or suggesting an enjoyable activity to uplift Classmate B's mood. Memory 2, on the other hand, focuses on the excitement over new cars and the sense of freedom they bring, which doesn't directly relate to the current feelings of dependency and frustration expressed by Classmate B. Thus, Memory 1 provides more useful and relevant information that could help Classmates A respond appropriately by offering support.\n\nChoice: 1"
