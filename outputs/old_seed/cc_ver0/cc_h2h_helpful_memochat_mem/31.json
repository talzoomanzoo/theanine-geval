This new job eventually caused Neighbors A to be promoted to manager and take on more responsibilities, leading to them feeling overwhelmed and stressed with a lot on their plate.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: ``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nNeighbors A: I marked the boundary line with a pen on the wall so that we can both be clear about where my property ends and your property begins. ### \n\n``` Neighbors A Input:\nRecent Dialogs: Neighbors A: I marked the boundary line with a pen on the wall so that we can both be clear about where my property ends and your property begins. ### \n\n``` Neighbors A Input:\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides information about Neighbor A's job and stress levels, which is not relevant to the current topic of property boundaries. MEMORY 2 repeats the same statement from the dialogue context but does not add any new information. However, its content is directly related to the boundary discussion. Although MEMORY 2 lacks additional useful information, it pertains directly to the current topic, unlike MEMORY 1.\n\nChoice: 2"
