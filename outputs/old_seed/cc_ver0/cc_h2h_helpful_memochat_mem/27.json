    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 2 is more helpful because it connects to the theme of weekend activities, which is what Co-worker A's singing at church was a part of. It provides a relevant context by showing that Co-worker A and B share personal activities, and Co-worker A is someone who likes to engage in mentally stimulating activities during the weekends. Memory 1, on the other hand, talks about Co-worker A and B planning a dinner, detective work, and social media research, which are unrelated to the discussion about singing at church and don't provide any meaningful context for Co-worker B's last statement.\n\nChoice: 2"
