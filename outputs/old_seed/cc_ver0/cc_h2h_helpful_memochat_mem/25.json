    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories discuss Neighbors A's previous dissatisfaction with their job and their desire to seek more fulfilling work. However, Memory 2 provides more detailed context about Neighbors A's past conversations about quitting their job and starting a new career, which ties directly to Neighbors A's current situation of having the financial freedom to pursue their business ideas.
