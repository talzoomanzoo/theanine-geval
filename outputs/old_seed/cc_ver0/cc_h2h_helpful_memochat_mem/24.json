    "prediction": "Explanation: The current dialogue context revolves around Neighbor A having inherited a significant amount of money and thinking about ways to manage it, including investments and starting a business. Neither MEMORY 1 nor MEMORY 2 is directly related to financial advice or managing sudden wealth. However, MEMORY 2 mentions Neighbor A discussing dissatisfaction with current job and potential career changes, which could relate to starting a new business, while MEMORY 1 primarily focuses on a career change and fatigue which doesn't align with the investment discussion. MEMORY 2 might somewhat help Neighbors B understand Neighbor A's mindset regarding starting a new business.\n\nChoice: 2"
