    "prediction": "Explanation: When responding to a question about keeping a secret, it is more relevant to choose a memory that involves sharing and discussions of significant personal events, as it implies trust and intimacy in communication. Memory 2 specifically includes a dialogue where Neighbor A shares their telekinetic ability with Neighbor B, which seems aligned with the context of sharing a secret. This suggests that Neighbors A trusts Neighbors B with personal, potentially sensitive information.\n\nChoice: 2"
