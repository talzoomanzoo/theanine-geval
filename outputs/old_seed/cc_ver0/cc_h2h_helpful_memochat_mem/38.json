    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 is focused on the husband's goals, effort, and support from the wife, which relates to their shared commitments and aspirations. This is relevant to the couple's plan to spend quality time together. MEMORY 2 highlights a specific past event where the husband disappointed the wife by leaving without her, but it also emphasizes positive relationship moments such as dancing together. Although it provides insight into their past interactions and the importance of promises, it lacks direct relevance to planning a getaway. MEMORY 1 ties more directly to the couple's plans and enthusiasm for future endeavors, which is aligned with the current conversation about going on a weekend getaway.\n\nChoice: 1"
