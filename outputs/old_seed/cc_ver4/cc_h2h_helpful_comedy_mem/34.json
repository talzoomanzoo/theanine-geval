Having a supportive boss can make all the difference in how you feel about your job.\nCo-workers A: Definitely. It makes me feel secure in my position and motivated to do my best work.\nCo-workers B: It's great to have that kind of positive reinforcement. Do you remember when we were working on that movie together and you were feeling really frustrated?\nCo-workers A: Oh yeah, I remember. I was so angry after blowing up that rabbit with the dynamite. But talking it out with you really helped me work through my emotions.\nCo-workers B: That's right. It's important to have someone to talk to when you're feeling overwhelmed or upset. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- Co-worker A mentioned a past event involving blowing up a rabbit with dynamite, indicating a history of poor coping mechanisms for frustration, which led to Co-worker B expressing disapproval and suggesting talking to the director to address the stressful situation.\n- Co-worker A felt remorse for what they did and appreciated Co-worker B's understanding during their collaboration, leading to personal growth in empathy and compassion.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description: Co-workers B is a director with no specific personal information available such as age, birthday, gender, height, weight, zodiac sign, Chinese zodiac sign, hometown, occupation, employer, education, or location. Their relationship status is also undisclosed.\n\nRelationship Description: Co-workers A and Co-workers B met on set and developed a good friendship. Despite initial intimidation, Co-workers A realized that Co-workers B is down-to-earth and easy to work with. They brought out the best in each other during the shoot, collaborated to make the movie successful, and are excited about future projects, possibly starting their own production company.\n\nEvent Description: Co-workers A blew up a rabbit with a stick of dynamite, which caused anger and frustration. Co-workers B questioned this action and advised Co-workers A to talk to the director about easing up on the schedule. Co-workers A acknowledged their mistake, felt bad, and thanked Co-workers B for the support and reminder to learn from mistakes. Additionally, Co-workers A saw a spider on the way to work and freaked out, revealing a childhood fear of spiders. Co-workers B suggested facing this fear as part of the process of dealing with frustrations. Co-workers A also surprised Co-workers B with their jewelry making talent, reflecting on personal growth and progress.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides more relevant details about the past event mentioned in the dialogue, offering context to Co-worker A's emotional history with stress and frustration. It adds depth to the current conversation by illustrating Co-worker A's previous outburst involving the rabbit and acknowledging their personal growth, supporting Co-worker B's remark on the importance of having someone to talk to. In contrast, MEMORY 1 primarily focuses on the disapproval by Co-worker B and lacks the additional context found in MEMORY 2 about their relationship dynamics and Co-worker A's personal progress.\n\nChoice: 2"
