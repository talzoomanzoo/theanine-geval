    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides detailed information about the relationship between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, highlighting A's gratitude, acknowledgment of mistakes, and overall personal growth. This aligns more closely with the dialogue context of gratitude toward a supportive boss, as it offers specific past interactions and themes of support and personal development that are relevant to the conversation. The context of being surprised by Co-worker A's personal growth and talent could also contribute to reinforcing themes of feeling supported and valued. MEMORY 1, while sharing some thematic similarities around collaboration and positivity, doesn't directly engage with the boss-employee gratitude dynamic.\n\nChoice: 2"
