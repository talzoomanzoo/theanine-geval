    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 focuses on Classmates A's activities in the community, their attempts at self-care, and their allergic reactions. While community involvement is an admirable trait of Classmates A, this MEMORY does not directly address the topic of camping or provide information related to being prepared for camping. It mostly talks about Classmates A's growth and actions rather than their practical knowledge around outdoor activities.\n\nMEMORY 2, on the other hand, describes Classmates B as supportive and action-oriented, values which align with the context of being prepared for camping. The MEMORY also mentions discussions about taking precautions for allergic reactions and carrying necessary medication. This aligns well with Classmates B's last utterance regarding the importance of being prepared with camping gear, including items like first-aid and extra supplies, making this MEMORY highly relevant and useful in the given context.\n\nChoice: 2"
