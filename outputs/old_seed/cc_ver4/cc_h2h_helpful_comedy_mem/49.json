    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 contains a specific reference to the husband's past experience of facing his fear of public speaking during a fifth-grade presentation, which aligns directly with the wife's suggestion in the dialogue context for him to take a risk and try something new in his writing. This information is directly relevant and useful as it reinforces the wife's encouragement with a personal and relatable example. Memory 2 does mention the same event, but it is part of a broader, less focused description of the relationship, which makes it less directly relevant to the current context of writing and creativity. \n\nChoice: 1"
