    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context involves Classmates A and B discussing Classmate B's red and splotchy face due to embarrassment. In this context, it would be useful to have information that either relates to Classmate B's feelings or their interaction dynamics. MEMORY 2 provides information about Classmate B's feelings of gratitude and their struggles with parking, which are more relevant to emotional states and their dynamic. This could help Classmate A respond with empathy or further support. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, focuses more on Classmate A's attributes and past situations related to driving tests, which are less pertinent to the current discussion about embarrassment.\n\nChoice: 2"
