    "prediction": "Explanation: The Mentee has been struggling with loneliness after moving to a new city and has mentioned that they have recently made a new friend at work. The MEMORY should provide information related to making connections or experiences related to moving and starting anew. \n\nMEMORY 1 includes relevant information about the Mentee accepting a job in the new city, which is directly related to their current situation. MEMORY 2 also mentions this information. However, MEMORY 1 includes additional details about the Mentor's overall long-term guidance and support, which could be relevant for further discussions about ongoing support and transition into the new job. Both memories contain some relevant information, but MEMORY 1 provides a more comprehensive context for the Mentor's role.\n\nChoice: 1"
