I was promoted to product manager!\nCo-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge.\nCo-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail.\nCo-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of new products, remember when you used to fantasize about being a great leader?\nCo-workers A: Ha, yeah. That seems like ages ago.\nCo-workers B: Well, now you can finally take on that leadership role and make your dreams a reality.\nCo-workers A: That's true. It's amazing how life works out sometimes.

I remember you were really dedicated to it a couple of years ago.\nCo-workers A: Oh yeah, I still try to keep up with it whenever I can. It's important to stay physically and mentally fit, especially with this new job.\nCo-workers B: Just don't let your anger get the better of you again.

    "prediction": "Explanation: To respond appropriately to the last utterance about managing anger and past explosive behavior, Co-worker A needs a reminder about both the importance of leadership qualities, including emotional management and effective communication. MEMORY 1 explicitly addresses these points, highlighting the need for Co-worker A to manage emotions and the history of stressed interactions resolved through communication. This is more directly relevant to the dialogue context than MEMORY 2, which focuses more generally on leadership aspirations without delving into the necessary personal qualities and past interactions related to the current topic.\n\nChoice: 1"
