    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is about camping, discussing the suitability and features of the camping spot. Neither MEMORY is directly related to camping, but considering Classmate A and B's shared interest in community involvement can indirectly relate to responsible camping or environmental consciousness. MEMORY 1 focuses more on Classmate A's actions and notions of positive impact, while MEMORY 2 touches more on shared experiences (e.g., attending a party together) and includes concerns about a party, which are less relevant to the camping context.\n\nChoice: 1"
