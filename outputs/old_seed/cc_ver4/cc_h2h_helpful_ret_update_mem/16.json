    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context revolves around Co-worker A singing a solo at church and discussing their love for singing. Neither memory directly addresses singing or church, but Memory 2 provides a little more context about personal relationships and histories between the co-workers, which could be relevant in understanding the dynamics between them. Memory 1, on the other hand, mostly focuses on plans unrelated to the current conversation. \n\nChoice: 2"
