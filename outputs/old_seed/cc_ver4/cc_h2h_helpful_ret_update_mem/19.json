I feel like we have something special going on here.\nClassmates B:  You're right. Our class definitely has a unique energy about it. What do you think sets us apart from other classes?\nClassmates A:  I think it's our sense of community. We all support each other and work together to achieve our goals.\nClassmates B:  That's definitely a big factor.

Classmates A confessed their love for Classmates B, who does not feel the same way.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around the unique dynamics and qualities of the classmates' cohort, emphasizing community support, diversity, and shared goals. Neither MEMORY explicitly addresses these elements directly; however, MEMORY 2, with details of verbal compliments and acknowledgment of past conversations, could hint at interactions contributing to camaraderie. Details like wearing suits for events might relate to more group activities. In contrast, MEMORY 1 largely focuses on personal feelings and interests that seem less linked to the participatory and supportive group aspects mentioned. Therefore, MEMORY 2 offers slightly more relevance as it contains social interactions potentially reflective of the communal and cohesive class spirit discussed.\n\nChoice: 2"
