Trust me, it's for your own good.\nClassmates A: I guess you're right. But if I ever feel comfortable enough to share, will you promise not to tell anyone else? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Classmates A was nervous about fitting in but saw Classmates B as well-liked and wanted to be friends with them, which made Classmates A believe in the power of positivity and its impact on life.\n2.

    "prediction": "Explanation: In the Dialogue Context, Classmates A is concerned about Classmates B knowing something about their past that even their closest friends don't know. Classmates A wants reassurance that Classmates B will not share this information with anyone else if Classmates A decides to confide further in the future. Therefore, the most relevant information should revolve around trust, comfort, and the nature of their friendship. MEMORY 2 contains more specific information about the appreciation and encouragement within their relationship, particularly Classmates B's appreciation of Classmates A's genuine friendship and positive attitude, which speaks more directly to trust and comfort in their dynamic. MEMORY 1, while mentioning optimism and striving towards goals, doesn't address the underlying issue of trust any better than MEMORY 2 does.\n\nChoice: 2"
