    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context involves Neighbors A discussing their efforts to find a buyer for their new workout equipment product and expressing gratitude for Neighbors B's support. The memory that best supports this context would include information about the supportive dynamic between Neighbors A and B, rather than unrelated details about Neighbors B's dog or Neighbors A's behavior at work. Both memories provide context about the supportive relationship, but Memory 2 offers a more comprehensive view of their mutual support, specifically mentioning efforts and changes related to work, which could relate to Neighbors A's business endeavors.\n\nChoice: 2"
