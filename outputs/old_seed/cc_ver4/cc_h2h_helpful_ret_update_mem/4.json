    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Co-workers A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I'm the boss!\nCo-workers B: Yeah, we know. You don't have to remind us every five minutes.\nCo-workers A: I just want everything to go smoothly and according to plan.\nCo-workers B: I understand that, but it doesn't always have to be your way or the highway.\nCo-workers A: Well, I just think that my way is usually the best way.\nCo-workers B: And sometimes it is, but we all have different ideas and perspectives to bring to the table. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nCo-worker A is known for being competent and is trusted with important projects. This is reflected in how both Co-worker A and Co-worker B excel at working well with others and resolving issues. Additionally, Co-worker A is giving Co-worker B a massage to help them relax.\n\nBoth Co-worker A and Co-worker B value communication and understanding in relationships. This aligns with how they enjoy taking moments to connect with each other, finding these moments make work more enjoyable. Moreover, Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's competence and effort in their work, seeing Co-worker A as competent and reliable.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker A and Co-worker B excel at working well with others and resolving issues.\n2. Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace.\n3. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B value communication and understanding in relationships.\n4. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's competence and effort in their work.\n5. Co-worker A strives to do their best in their work.\n6. Co-worker A is seen as competent and reliable by Co-worker B.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 2 is more helpful in this context because it directly highlights the positive qualities and recognition Co-worker B has for Co-worker A's work ethic and competence, which can be relevant for Co-worker A to better appreciate the different perspectives and contributions to team discussions. On the other hand, Memory 1 includes irrelevant information about giving a massage, which doesn't contribute positively to the conversation about differing ideas and perspectives in the workplace.\n\nChoice: 2"
