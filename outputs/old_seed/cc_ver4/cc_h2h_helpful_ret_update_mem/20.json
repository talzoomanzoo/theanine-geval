    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Co-workers A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today?\nCo-workers B: No, you didn't. What did you do there? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- Co-worker B advises Co-worker A to be more disciplined and plan ahead for their actions. This leads to Co-worker B being supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable. Co-worker A recently moved to a new duplex with two floors, having their bedroom on the first floor and another room on the second floor. This change indicates that Co-worker A and their ex have both moved on from the breakup.\n\n- Co-worker B is concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits, which prompts Co-worker B to be supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable. As a result, Co-worker A is open to taking things slow and potentially finding a special person.\n\n- Co-worker A has been getting written up for being late to work, which is a reaction to Co-worker A going through a painful breakup and finding it hard to trust people.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker B is concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits.\n2. Co-worker B advises Co-worker A to be more disciplined and plan ahead for their actions.\n3. Co-worker A has been successful in not being late to work for weeks.\n4. Co-worker B is aware of Co-worker A's struggles with late nights out and expensive Uber rides.\n5. Co-worker A is trying to improve their punctuality and cut back on drinking.\n6. Co-worker A is trying to be more responsible but still working on avoiding late nights out and expensive rides.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 mainly focuses on the living situation of Co-worker A and Co-worker A's personal life, such as moving on from a breakup. However, it does not provide any specific information related to visiting the post office or tasks that might include visiting such a place. On the other hand, Memory 2 provides details about Co-worker A's efforts to improve punctuality, discipline, and reliability, which seem indirectly related to planning and executing daily activities like visiting a post office. Memory 2 offers more specific information about Co-worker A's habits and efforts to change, which might be relevant to the context of discussing task completion or daily errand habits, even though it still isn't directly about the post office visit.\n\nChoice: 2"
