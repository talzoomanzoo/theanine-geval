    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 provides a comprehensive and relevant background to the dialogue context. It highlights the mutual support between the co-workers during the movie set incident, ties in the personal growth and understanding Co-worker A experienced, and demonstrates Co-worker B's supportive role, which aligns with the context of having a supportive boss. Memory 2 does touch upon facing fears and managing frustrations, but it lacks the explicit detail of the movie set scenario and the specific emotional support Co-worker B provided. Therefore, Memory 1 is more directly helpful and relevant to understanding Co-worker A's gratitude towards supportive figures.\n\nChoice: 1"
