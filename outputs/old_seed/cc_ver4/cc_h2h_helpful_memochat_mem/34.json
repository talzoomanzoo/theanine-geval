It's important to have someone to talk to when you're feeling overwhelmed or upset. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- Co-worker A mentioned a past event involving blowing up a rabbit with dynamite, indicating a history of poor coping mechanisms for frustration, which led to Co-worker B expressing disapproval and suggesting talking to the director to address the stressful situation.\n- Co-worker A felt remorse for what they did and appreciated Co-worker B's understanding during their collaboration, leading to personal growth in empathy and compassion.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Facing Fears and Managing Frustrations', 'Related Summaries': 'Co-workers A discusses facing fears, managing frustrations, and seeking healthier coping mechanisms with Co-workers B.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Co-workers A: I was so embarrassed yesterday.

I remember running to my mom and dad whenever I saw one. ### Co-workers B: That's understandable. I mean, some people just have a fear of certain things. ### Co-workers A: Remember when I blew up the rabbit with dynamite? I think I was frustrated with myself and took it out on the poor thing. ### Co-workers B: Yeah, I remember you regretting that decision later on.

    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 is more helpful as it directly addresses the past event referenced in the dialogue context (blowing up a rabbit with dynamite) and includes information about Co-worker A's remorse, appreciation of Co-worker B's understanding, and personal growth in empathy. This information is relevant to continuing the conversation in a meaningful way, showing progression from past events to present feelings of gratitude for a supportive environment. Memory 2 provides additional context but is less focused on the specific emotional growth and support discussed in the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 1"
