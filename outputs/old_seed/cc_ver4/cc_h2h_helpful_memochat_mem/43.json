    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 2 is more helpful as it directly relates to Classmates A and B's conversations about environmental impact and action committees. This provides a relevant context for them to discuss community activities related to the outdoors, such as a potential clean-up during camping. Memory 1, on the other hand, is more focused on broader community involvement and personal care, which is less directly relevant to the camping situation.\n\nChoice: 2"
