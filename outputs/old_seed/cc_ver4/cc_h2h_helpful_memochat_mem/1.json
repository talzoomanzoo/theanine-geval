    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 repeats the conversation and contains fragments of past interactions which may not provide any additional insight or context for the current discussion. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, provides background on the characters, highlighting Co-worker A's character traits, such as past behavior of feeling guilt, and Co-worker B's supportive characteristics. This context might better enable Co-worker B to construct a response that takes into account their history of interactions.\n\nChoice: 1"
