MEMORY 2 is more closely related to the current situation, providing a detailed and relevant recollection of Neighbors B settling into the new home built by Neighbor A, which connects to their recent conversation about the completed house project. Additionally, it emphasizes gratitude and reflects on the outcome of previous efforts, which aligns with the dialogue's context of achieving goals and overcoming distractions.\n\nChoice: 2"
