    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides information about Classmates A's determination and competitiveness, their experience of feeling worried about being the best at everything, and the importance of enjoying the effort rather than just focusing on winning. This memory aligns well with the dialogue context where Classmates A mentions proving their brother wrong in a race and reflecting on determination. It is useful for Classmates B to respond in the context of motivation, determination, and the balance of enjoying the process.\n\nMEMORY 2 relates to past events of competitiveness and seeking support, including Classmates A's past race with their brother. While this is relevant, it is less directly connected to the current theme of focusing on personal development through studying algebra. It is more focused on past support from friends rather than the current context of self-improvement and determination in studying.\n\nChoice: 1"
