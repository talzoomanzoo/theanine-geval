The memories should provide useful information related to teamwork, school life, or experiences that highlight their collective approach and values. Memory 1 mostly discusses the relief and continued friendship between Classmates A and B after a personal conversation. Memory 2 describes similar aspects of their friendship and interactions but includes additional relevant details like the compliment on a suit and a wedding event, which might play into a broader context of social interactions but doesn't directly relate to the class's dynamics or characteristics.\n\nChoice: 1"
