It's perfect!\nClassmates B: Wow, this view is amazing!\nClassmates A: I know, right? And it's completely level and free of any debris. We won't have to worry about rolling off our sleeping pads or anything like that. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- Classmate A hopes to encourage others to get involved and create a ripple effect for positive change, expressing a desire to find alternative ways to have fun and make a positive impact in the community. Additionally, Classmate A agrees to take better care of themselves in the future.\n- Classmates B finds Classmates A's involvement in the community admirable and important, as Classmate B is involved in an action committee working on organizing a community clean-up day. Furthermore, Classmates A was part of an action committee in high school to improve the community.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Classmates B finds Classmates A's involvement in the community admirable and important.\n2. Classmate A and Classmate B are classmates who attended a party together.\n3. Classmate A expresses a desire to find alternative ways to have fun and make a positive impact in the community.\n4. Classmates B remembers Classmates A's previous involvement in community improvement projects and acknowledges their passion for making a difference.\n5. Classmate A is concerned about the party being discovered and getting in trouble with the school.\n6. Classmate A agrees to take better care of themselves in the future.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 includes information about Classmate B's involvement in a community action committee, which is irrelevant to the current context of a camping trip and the practical aspects of setting up a camp. Memory 2, though containing similar information, doesn't provide any additional useful details that would help Classmates B respond specifically to the camping situation. Since both memories focus more on community involvement rather than camping, there's no added advantage of one over the other in terms of relevance to the current dialogue.\n\nChoice: tie"
