Having a supportive boss can make all the difference in how you feel about your job.\nCo-workers A: Definitely. It makes me feel secure in my position and motivated to do my best work.\nCo-workers B: It's great to have that kind of positive reinforcement. Do you remember when we were working on that movie together and you were feeling really frustrated?\nCo-workers A: Oh yeah, I remember. I was so angry after blowing up that rabbit with the dynamite. But talking it out with you really helped me work through my emotions.\nCo-workers B: That's right. It's important to have someone to talk to when you're feeling overwhelmed or upset. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- Co-worker A mentioned a past event involving blowing up a rabbit with dynamite, indicating a history of poor coping mechanisms for frustration, which led to Co-worker B expressing disapproval and suggesting talking to the director to address the stressful situation.\n- Co-worker A felt remorse for what they did and appreciated Co-worker B's understanding during their collaboration, leading to personal growth in empathy and compassion.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B feel that their collaboration brought out the best in each other during the shoot.\n2. Co-worker A felt remorse for what they did and appreciated Co-worker B's understanding.\n3. Co-worker A and Co-worker B met on a movie set and are now good friends.\n4. Co-worker B acknowledges that some people have fears and suggests finding healthy ways to deal with frustrations.\n5. Co-worker B emphasized the importance of learning from mistakes and working together as a team.\n6. Co-worker A had a tough week on set, feeling overwhelmed and chaotic.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories provide useful context about Co-worker A's past experiences and emotions when dealing with frustration on set. However, MEMORY 1 provides more specific information about Co-worker A's action of blowing up a rabbit with dynamite and the subsequent conversations that led to personal growth, which is directly relevant to the current dialogue context discussing the importance of having someone to talk to when upset. MEMORY 2 contains several points, but they are broader and less focused on the particular event referenced in the dialogue context. Therefore, MEMORY 1 is more helpful in adding depth to the conversation and allowing Co-worker A to further reflect on their past experiences.\n\nChoice: 1"
