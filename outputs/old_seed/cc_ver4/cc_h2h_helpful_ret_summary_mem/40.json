What about it?\nCo-workers A: Well, I wanted to share some good news with you. I've been recently promoted to the night shift and have been doing a great job.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context highlights Co-worker A's insecurities, achievements, and progress over the years, particularly focusing on their love for singing and being promoted at work. Memory 2 succinctly captures key elements relevant to the dialogue context, such as Co-worker A's nervousness and self-doubt despite achievements and their passion for music, while also highlighting the dynamics of support and encouragement from Co-worker B. Memory 1, on the other hand, is repetitive and less clear, with excessive focus on past mistakes and a change in Co-worker A's behavior, which are not directly pertinent to the current dialogue. Memory 2's clarity and direct relevance make it more helpful.\n\nChoice: 2"
