    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just tried this breathing exercise and it really helped me relax.\nNeighbors B: What kind of breathing exercise?\nNeighbors A: It's just a simple one, where you inhale for four seconds, hold your breath for seven seconds, and then exhale for eight seconds. I've been doing it every day for the past week and it's made such a difference.\nNeighbors B: That's really interesting. I've heard that breathing exercises can be really helpful for reducing stress and anxiety.\nNeighbors A: Yes, it definitely has helped me with that. Plus, it's something that I can easily do anywhere, whether I'm at home or out running errands.\nNeighbors B: That's great. It's always good to have a simple tool like that to help manage stress. \nNeighbors A: Speaking of managing stress, remember a few years ago when I pushed your shoulder because I wanted you to accept me?\nNeighbors B: Oh yeah, I do remember that. That was a stressful time for both of us.\nNeighbors A: It definitely was. But I'm so glad that we've been able to move past that and have a good neighborly relationship now. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbors A surprised Neighbors B with a pizza, showing appreciation for their actions in the neighborhood. This gesture made Neighbors B value their friendship with Neighbors A. This led to both neighbors enjoying discovering new things in their neighborhood and spending time with their children, looking forward to new adventures and possibilities in the future.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbor B reassures Neighbor A about past embarrassing incidents and emphasizes their current friendship.\n2. Neighbors B values their friendship with Neighbors A.\n3. Neighbors A is willing to take things slow in their relationship with Neighbors B.\n4. Neighbors A did this as a gesture of appreciation for Neighbors B's actions in the neighborhood.\n5. Neighbor A is embarrassed about a past incident where they pushed Neighbor B's shoulder to gain acceptance.\n6. Neighbors A has developed romantic feelings for Neighbors B.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context centers around a past incident where Neighbors A pushed Neighbors B's shoulder and reflects on how they have moved past a stressful time to have a good neighborly relationship now. Memory 2 directly addresses the past incident and the reassurance given by Neighbors B, making it more relevant and useful for understanding the context of their relationship dynamics. Memory 1, while similar in mentioning friendship, emphasizes a pizza gift and does not adequately address the past incident mentioned by Neighbors A regarding acceptance and stress.\n\nChoice: 2"
