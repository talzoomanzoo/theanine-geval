MEMORY 1 is directly relevant to this as it mentions Speaker B's involvement in motivational speaking, which they got into to combat personal challenges, thereby offering a substantial connection. In contrast, MEMORY 2 focuses more broadly on the relationship and other background details, without emphasizing specific motivational speaking expertise.\n\nChoice: 1"
