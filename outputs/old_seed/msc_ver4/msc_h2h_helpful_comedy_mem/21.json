    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go?\nSpeaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \nSpeaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on?\nSpeaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study?\nSpeaker B: Ah, English should be easier than History. Sure, I can help you. What do you need to do exactly? Write an essay?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, we have to write an essay and we have a spelling component towards the end of the exam, I sure could use a little help!\nSpeaker B: No problem! I like correcting and editing essays. Although, it seems like your English is pretty good. I doubt you even need much help. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B is on their way to college and studying sports medicine, while Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\nSpeaker B feels overwhelmed by their mother's strictness and is eager to finish school to escape it, similar to how Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring.\nSpeaker A wishes to get better grades and is hopeful for a soccer scholarship, just like Speaker B who plays soccer and does not have any siblings.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nSpeaker B is a college student studying sports medicine with a passion for soccer. They are an only child and their mother runs the school they attend. Speaker B is focused on getting good grades and is determined to excel in their studies and soccer career.\n\nRelationship Description:\nSpeaker B and the robot, Speaker A, have a friendly and supportive relationship. They engage in conversations about sports, voting, and personal experiences. Speaker B encourages Speaker A to relax and take breaks when needed.\n\nEvents Description:\n1. Speaker A finished a 5-mile hike with a poorly managed trail.\n2. Speaker B is interested in joining a soccer game and is glad Speaker A made it back safely from the hike.\n3. Speaker A and Dave plan to go hiking, while Speaker B is studying for a sports medicine exam.\n4. Speaker A wants to play soccer on Saturday at 3 pm, and Speaker B agrees to join, planning to bring bottled water. \n5. Speaker B gives tips on sports medicine training to Speaker A, who hopes to get all A's in school and secure a soccer scholarship.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: In the current dialogue context, Speaker A mentioned they have an English exam and asked Speaker B to help study for it. There is no mention of soccer or sports medicine within the context. Therefore, the relevant memory should provide context about Speaker B's ability to help with English or their background in academics rather than something unrelated to the study of English.\n\nChoice: 1\n\nThis is because Memory 1 indicates Speaker B's assistance to Speaker A regarding majors, suggesting struggles in history but no direct help in English. It is not specifically helpful for the current context of an English exam, but it gives more academic context. Memory 2 is more about sports, hiking, and unrelated events that do not help with the English final or essay mentioned in the context. Therefore, neither memory is perfectly helpful, but if forced to choose, Memory 1 may slightly help more with understanding both Speaker A's struggles in other subjects (history) and the context of academic improvement."
