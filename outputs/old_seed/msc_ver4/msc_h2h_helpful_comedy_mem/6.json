Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\nSpeaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach?\nSpeaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option.\nSpeaker A: Yes I think history is interesting, too! Both of those subjects would be great because there are probably lots of teaching jobs. What kind of history do you like?\nSpeaker B: I love all sorts of history. Right now I am really getting into the weeds of World War II. There's so much to unpack.\nSpeaker A: For sure! So much happened and it really affected how the world is today. I like learning about the history of places where I have lived, it's really interesting.\nSpeaker B: That sounds really cool! What have you learned about where you currently live?\nSpeaker A: Oh, I found out that the big sports field used to be a farm where they grew wheat and raised cows! It's really cool to see places in old photos and see how they have changed. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. Speaker B mentions feeling limited in job opportunities and is studying linguistics. Speaker A is studying computer science and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth, as well as being interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nSpeaker A is a kind individual who helps out his grandparents as they are getting older. He works at a pizza shop and is living with his grandparents. Speaker A used to play football a lot and enjoys hanging out with friends or playing video games like Elder Scrolls Series, Witcher, Legend of Zelda, and Super Mario Bros.

Speaker A had a great first practice with the intramural football league.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B talk about their experiences with football and soccer, showing their shared interest in sports.\n3. Speaker A plans to teach courses in computer science at a community college and get involved with robotics.\n4. Speaker B is studying Linguistics and expresses a desire to find job opportunities in the field.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The MEMORY 1 provides relevant information about Speaker B's academic background and career aspirations related to teaching, which aligns with the conversation about career plans and potential teaching subjects. It mentions Speaker B considering further studies to potentially become a college professor, which ties back to the discussion about teaching and career stability. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, primarily contains personal and recreational information about Speaker A, which doesn't contribute to the immediate context of discussing career options and educational interests.\n\nChoice: 1"
