    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither of the MEMORIES directly address the question about whether Speaker A has more exams coming up or if they are on a break. However, MEMORY 2 provides overall context about Speaker B's focus on getting good grades and their supportive relationship with Speaker A, which might help imply that Speaker B would understand if Speaker A also has other commitments or exams. This context can lead Speaker A to respond more empathetically or relate to Speaker B's sentiment about exams, even though it does not directly answer the question.\n\nChoice: 2"
