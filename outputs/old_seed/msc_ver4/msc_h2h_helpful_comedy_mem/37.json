    "prediction": "Explanation: When considering which memory is more helpful for responding to the given dialogue context regarding pet snakes named Hensel and Gretel, MEMORY 2 provides information specifically mentioning the snakes and includes other relevant details that can contribute to an engaging conversation. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, lacks this specific reference to the snakes and instead focuses more broadly on shared interests and experiences unrelated to the current topic of conversation, making it less helpful in the immediate context.\n\nChoice: 2"
