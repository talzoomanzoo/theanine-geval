    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go?\nSpeaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \nSpeaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on?\nSpeaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study?\nSpeaker B: Ah, English should be easier than History. Sure, I can help you. What do you need to do exactly? Write an essay?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, we have to write an essay and we have a spelling component towards the end of the exam, I sure could use a little help!\nSpeaker B: No problem! I like correcting and editing essays. Although, it seems like your English is pretty good. I doubt you even need much help. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B is on their way to college and studying sports medicine, while Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\nSpeaker B feels overwhelmed by their mother's strictness and is eager to finish school to escape it, similar to how Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring.\nSpeaker A wishes to get better grades and is hopeful for a soccer scholarship, just like Speaker B who plays soccer and does not have any siblings.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n2. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n3. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n4. Both speakers value good grades and believe it can lead to better job opportunities.\n5. Speaker B feels overwhelmed by their mother's strictness and is eager to finish school to escape it.\n6. Speaker A advises Speaker B to take breaks and prioritize their own happiness and well-being.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The relevant information from MEMORY 1 highlights Speaker B's eagerness to finish school to escape their mother's strictness, which relates to the current context of handling stress during exams. It also touches on Speaker A's struggle with making good grades, which is pertinent since they are discussing performance in school. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, although it includes general pressures about grades and advice on prioritizing well-being, adds redundant details that are less pertinent to the immediate conversation about studying for finals and getting help with English.\n\nChoice: 1"
