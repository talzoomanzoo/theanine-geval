    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden?\nSpeaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends.\nSpeaker A: That sounds nice! So how is your job going?\nSpeaker B: Always interesting, that's for sure! I have been training to nurse on a new floor, so that'll give me a change of scenery.\nSpeaker A: Does that add a lot of extra work to your plate? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses, which causes Speaker A to consider visiting their cousin in Sweden and save money for the trip. Speaker B recommends checking out the volcanoes in Sweden for a unique experience, which they would like to do together. Speaker B grew up in Sweden and developed an interest in good coffee and chocolates, which was discussed with Speaker A.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n4. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n5. Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n6. Speaker B recommends checking out the volcanoes in Sweden for a unique experience.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The current dialogue context involves Speaker A asking Speaker B about their job, specifically if training to nurse on a new floor adds extra work to their plate. Therefore, memories related to their careers or any relevant personal information about their work experience would be more helpful for Speaker B to respond appropriately.\n\nMEMORY 1 contains information about Speaker B's interest in good coffee and chocolates due to their time in Sweden but does not mention anything about their career, job, or nursing experience. MEMORY 2 does not contain any relevant information related to Speaker B's job or their recent training experience, either.\n\nBoth memories are equally unhelpful for the current context as they focus on travel to Sweden, which is not relevant to the current job discussion.\n\nChoice: tie"
