Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \nSpeaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along!\nSpeaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them.\nSpeaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me! \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A has a pet parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten. Speaker A is a country girl who loves animals and is considering adopting a rescue kitten despite having a parrot. Speaker A is interested in training tips for the kittens and is open to adopting one despite having a parrot. Speaker B has an older mellow cat and is concerned about training the new energetic kittens.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n2. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n3. Speaker A is interested in training tips for the kittens and is open to adopting one despite having a parrot.\n4. Speaker B has two sick kitties and recently received a rescue.\n5. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n6. Speaker A's parrot Tasha has seen cats before and ignores them.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context has shifted from discussing pets to the topic of hiking and the hot summer weather. Memory 1 contains information that is more relevant and helpful for this new topic as it hints that Speaker A is a country girl who loves animals and might relate to outdoor activities like hiking. Memory 2, on the other hand, focuses more on the specifics of pet adoption and training, which is somewhat irrelevant to the current discussion about hiking. Additionally, Memory 1 does mention Speaker B's older mellow cat, which could be linked to the idea that hot weather might also affect pets who like to be outdoors.\n\nChoice: 1"
