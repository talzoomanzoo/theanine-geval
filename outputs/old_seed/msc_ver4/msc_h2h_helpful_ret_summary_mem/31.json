    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides detailed and relevant context for the conversation, including Speaker B's recent purchase of Resident Evil VIII and their habit of playing it alone in the dark to enhance the experience. This directly addresses the question asked by Speaker A and could lead to meaningful further discussion based on Speaker B's experiences with the game. MEMORY 1, while also providing some relevant details, lacks the specific personal experience with Resident Evil that MEMORY 2 includes, making it less directly useful for responding to the question.\n\nChoice: 2"
