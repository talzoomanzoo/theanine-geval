Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden?\nSpeaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends.\nSpeaker A: That sounds nice! So how is your job going?\nSpeaker B: Always interesting, that's for sure! I have been training to nurse on a new floor, so that'll give me a change of scenery.\nSpeaker A: Does that add a lot of extra work to your plate? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses, which causes Speaker A to consider visiting their cousin in Sweden and save money for the trip. Speaker B recommends checking out the volcanoes in Sweden for a unique experience, which they would like to do together. Speaker B grew up in Sweden and developed an interest in good coffee and chocolates, which was discussed with Speaker A.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discussed the differences between Sweden and the US, including coffee breaks.\n4. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n5. Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n6. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: In this dialogue context, Speaker A is inquiring about Speaker B's job and how the training might affect their workload. The memories should ideally provide context or background on Speaker B's job or their current workload to help respond to the question.\n\nMemory 1 contains information about Speaker B's past in Sweden and their recommendations for visiting, but it does not provide any relevant information about Speaker B's current job situation. Similarly, Memory 2 mostly discusses travel plans to Sweden and Speaker A's cousin, with no mention of Speaker B's job.\n\nNeither memory provides relevant context to Speaker B's situation at their job or their ongoing training. However, Memory 2 does mention Speaker A and Speaker B's travel discussions, which could be indirectly useful if it relates to future job plans or time off.\n\nChoice: tie"
