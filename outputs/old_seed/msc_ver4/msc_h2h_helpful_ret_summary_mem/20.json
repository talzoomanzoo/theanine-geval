    "prediction": "Explanation: The Dialogue Context involves a discussion about exams, specifically mentioning Speaker A's history exam and querying whether Speaker A has upcoming exams. Both MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 provide relevant information about the academic pressures and subjects each speaker is dealing with, which can help in relating to the conversation about exams. However, MEMORY 2 provides a more comprehensive picture of Speaker A's struggles with history and gym, which is directly relevant to the context as the current topic is about exams and academic performance.\n\nChoice: 2"
