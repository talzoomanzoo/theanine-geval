Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\nSpeaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it.\nSpeaker A: Cool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot. What is your favorite part about camping?\nSpeaker B: I love being out in the wilderness and sleeping under the stars in the fresh air. It makes you realize how beautiful life is and how small we really are in comparison to the universe.\nSpeaker A: I miss doing that! I have done lots of picnics with my family but it's been a long time since I've slept in a tent! Looking forward to it again when the kids are older. Where was the last place you went?\nSpeaker B: We went up to an island in the middle of nowhere in Canada. There were lots of bears and huge moose!\nSpeaker A: Wow, that sounds like such an adventure! I love to visit Canada. I have seen moose but never a bear! That must have been scary! \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout. Speaker A is involved in church activities and mentioned a church retreat. Speaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat. Speaker B plans to earn the Eagle Scout badge for college applications.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat.\n2. Speaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout.\n3. Speaker A is involved in church activities and mentioned a church retreat\n4. Speaker B is busy with scouts, school, work, and tennis, but willing to take vacation days for the retreat.\n5. Speaker A suggested that Speaker B join one of the church retreats in the future.\n6. Speaker B is a member of the boy scouts and works at a fast food place\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The current dialogue context revolves around Speaker B's experience with Boy Scouts, camping, and adventures in Canada. Memory 1 provides a relevant context related to scouting and the aim of attaining the Eagle Scout badge, which might relate to their motivation and dedication within the scouting experience. Memory 2, however, contains additional information about Speaker B's busy schedule and their work, which is not directly relevant to the current conversation about the camping trip and the experiences there. Therefore, Memory 1 is more pertinent to the conversation at hand, focusing on scouting and personal aspirations within that framework.\n\nChoice: 1"
