Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone?  \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- Speaker A, a runner who dislikes traveling but has visited 20 countries, wants to improve their mile time and train for a marathon. This causes Speaker A to seek advice on marathon training and recovery. As a result, Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and scheduling a beach meeting at 0600.\n\n- Speaker B, who travels frequently for work and misses their wife and kids, wants to work on improving their mile time and train for a marathon like Speaker A. This causes Speaker A to seek advice on marathon training and recovery. Speaker B is considering running a marathon and has mentioned fishing and feeling depressed, which is a similar topic to Speaker A's marathon training.\n\n- Speaker A, a runner who dislikes traveling but has visited 20 countries, wants Speaker B to get into motivational speaking. This change occurred after Speaker B ran a marathon and found it tough but rewarding. Speaker B got into motivational speaking as a way to battle depression and anxiety, a topic they joked about while mentioning fishing and feeling depressed.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Motivational Speaking', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker B shares about being a motivational speaker and how it helps them overcome personal struggles.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: I'm a motivational speaker! I get invited to different schools and conferences to give a little pep talk! ### Speaker A: That sounds amazing. Do you motivate people to be successful? Do go after their dreams? That kind of a thing? ### Speaker B: Basically yes. And to strive forwards through hardships. Just like your injury! ### Speaker A: We all go through struggles. Sometimes we need people to pull us up out of the abyss. How did you get into motivational speaking? ### Speaker B: I think it began because I needed motivational speaking myself. I've always needed to battle bouts of depression and anxiety. Motivational speeches and being in nature both help me to this day.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: How did the speech go?

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is directly relevant because it focuses on Speaker B's role as a motivational speaker and how they have used it to overcome personal struggles. This is precisely the context needed since Speaker A is inquiring about a motivational speaker to help their friend. MEMORY 1 contains more background information about running and personal experiences but lacks a direct connection to Speaker B's experience and involvement in motivational speaking.\n\nChoice: 2"
