Does your school have any good connections to those type of internships? ### Speaker B: It isn't the best school in the country for sports medicine, but the program is pretty well regarded. I've spent the past few hours asking some of my professors to write letters of recommendation to a couple of clinics around the area. ### Speaker A: Ah, that's a great idea.
