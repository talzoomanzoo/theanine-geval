Speaker A, who works as a personal trainer leading hikes, is nervous about the Appalachian Trail hike as they don't usually do full day hikes.

Considering a cruise instead next year for something different. ### Speaker B: Ah that sounds nice, I reckon you'll love cruises too. I've not been camping for a long time, I love been out in the outdoors ### Speaker A: I enjoy looking for wild animals in the woods.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides specific context about Speaker A's recent and upcoming hiking plans, including their concerns about taking part in the Appalachian Trail and undertaking full day hikes. This directly relates to Speaker B's question about whether Speaker A has been hiking lately and would help Speaker A in providing a detailed response. MEMORY 2, while it provides general information about outdoor activities, does not directly address recent hikes or plans, making it less immediately useful for responding to the question of recent hiking activities.\n\nChoice: 1"
