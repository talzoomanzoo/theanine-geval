    "prediction": "Explanation: The purpose of selecting a helpful memory is to assist Speaker B in responding appropriately and contextually to Speaker A's excitement about winning an origami contest and their plans to include this achievement in their CV. Memory 1 provides specific details about Speaker A's personal interest and activities related to origami, such as enjoying art, learning origami independently, and volunteering while making origami crafts. This information can allow Speaker B to make a more personalized and relevant response, acknowledging Speaker Aâ€™s skills and interests. Memory 2, however, contains broader conversations about origami between the speakers but lacks specific personal details about Speaker A's recent achievements or interests that would directly align with Speaker A's current context of winning a contest. \n\nChoice: 1"
