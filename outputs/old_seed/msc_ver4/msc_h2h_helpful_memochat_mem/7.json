    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains specific information that Speaker B might use to connect with Speaker A about the zoo visit, specifically mentioning Joshua, the tiger, which is relevant to the ongoing discussion. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 provides a broader context about zoo visits but doesn't mention Joshua explicitly. Speaker A has just mentioned seeing Joshua in the zoo which was followed with a direct question about ticket types, making MEMORY 1 more aligned in terms of specific user interests and facilitating further specific conversation about the zoo visit.\n\nChoice: 1"
