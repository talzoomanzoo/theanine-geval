Do you miss it?\nSpeaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \nSpeaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living.\nSpeaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime?\nSpeaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with.\nSpeaker A: Sounds great! Now the tough question: when do you have time?\nSpeaker B: It would have to be sometime when I'm off work, maybe on the weekend.  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket and is a member of a soccer team, enjoying playing in tournaments. \nSpeaker A played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United. \nSpeaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week, being a fan of Arsenal and enjoying watching international teams play.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Sports and Soccer', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A talks about playing soccer and an upcoming tournament, while Speaker B shares past soccer experiences.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: Well at least you like the work for now! I am still on the soccer team. We have a tournament coming up next week that I'm really excited for. I think we might have a chance to win it! ### Speaker B: Striker, right? How're you scoring these days? ### Speaker A: Right! It definitely feels like I'm on a hot streak. Hopefully it keeps up through the tournament. One of our other players is injured, though. Did you ever play sports? ### Speaker B: I played intramural soccer in college. Nowadays I mainly just watch it. I like Manchester United, they're my favorite team. Do you like a particular US or FIFA team? ### Speaker A: I love Arsenal, even though they aren't doing so well lately. I can't wait for the season to start up again. I do enjoy watching the international teams in the meantime. Having the tournaments on is so fun!' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college? ###Speaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position.  ###Speaker A: Exciting when it really counts though!
