I'm leaning towards Pulp Fiction, have you ever seen it? ### Speaker B: Oh yes. It's a classic. It has so many great actors and actresses. The whole movie is amazing. Have you seen it before? ### Speaker A: No, I haven't. I think Uma Thurman looks so exotic though.  It just sounds like a very unique kind of movie. I'm not sure why I've never watched it before. ### Speaker B: Wow! I don't want to make you feel too bad for not seeing it after all this time. But I must encourage you to go see it as soon as possible! I can't spoil it for you. You'll love it! ### Speaker A: Thank you!  With your background, I bet you have a lot of great suggestions for movies, some of them fairly off the beaten path. I'll have to rely upon you for suggestions I think!  ### Speaker B: If you want more suggestions, just let me know! Just tell me what kind of movie you're looking for and I'll give you suggestions! ### Speaker A: I like all types of movies really. It mostly depends on the mood I'm in at the time.  I'm almost always in the mood for a good comedy though! ### Speaker B: Well then you gotta check out Coming 2 America! It has Eddie Murphy in it.

Eddie Murphy has teamed up so well with a lot of actors.  I had high hopes for the movie he was in with DeNiro, but I was disappointed. ### Speaker B: Are you talking about Showtime? I'm surprised. Eddie Murphy was a cop in Beverly Hills trilogy which was hilarious, and he's a cop in this film.
