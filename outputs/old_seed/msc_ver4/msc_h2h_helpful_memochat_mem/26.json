It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume.\nSpeaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment. \nSpeaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think?\nSpeaker A: It depends on what you are trying to make out of origami, you can make some super complicated stuff, there's actually special paper that you can get for it! You may have seen origami be used in the hospital for some breathing aperatus!\nSpeaker B: That's amazing. I had no idea, but that totally makes sense. Do you have to practice a lot -- sort of a use it or lose it kind of thing?\nSpeaker A: Yea, I think for the more complicated origami it's kind of a use it or lose it but for the simple stuff you can usually take a couple months of and still remember to do it! Did you see origami in Japan?\nSpeaker B: Not up close, but I noticed a lot in shop windows in certain areas. I love Japan -- they're so welcoming. One of our acquaintances GAVE me a kimono. She said it's customary to try to share their culture. Kind of different from America in my opinion.  \nSpeaker A: Oh, that sounds wonderful. It's impressive how much things that came from there and how giving a culture they are. America is definetly a lot different from them, have you visted different states in America?\nSpeaker B: Oh yes. I live in North Carolina, but I've been to almost every state. Alaska was by far my favorite, but I'm kind of a loner and it feels like a lot of people there are, so maybe I just relate. But the scenery and landscapes are unbelievably beautiful. What's your favorite place you've been to? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A finds meaning and fulfillment in doing volunteer work. This has led Speaker A to work on painting projects in their craft room. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next and wishes to visit the country where origami was originally created, possibly Japan.\n\nSpeaker B has visited 20 countries and enjoys the color turquoise. This love for traveling and visiting gardens has led Speaker B to be recommended volunteering by Speaker A. Speaker B has traveled to Japan and Italy, enjoying the art and food, and found Japan to be an amazing country.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'origami discussion', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B discuss origami, sharing experiences and plans to try it together.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: I tried the origami Lotus that you suggested.

I could teach you. ### Speaker B: In a few weeks I'll have more time. Maybe we could try then.

I would really like to make origami animals. It think it'd be cute. Are those hard to make? ### Speaker A: Well it depend on if you're talking about just their heads or if you want to make their whole body, I think the heads are easier. ### Speaker B: I would prefer to make their whole bodies, just a head seems a bit weird.
