I'm leaning towards Pulp Fiction, have you ever seen it? ### Speaker B: Oh yes. It's a classic. It has so many great actors and actresses. The whole movie is amazing. Have you seen it before? ### Speaker A: No, I haven't. I think Uma Thurman looks so exotic though.  It just sounds like a very unique kind of movie. I'm not sure why I've never watched it before. ### Speaker B: Wow! I don't want to make you feel too bad for not seeing it after all this time. But I must encourage you to go see it as soon as possible! I can't spoil it for you. You'll love it! ### Speaker A: Thank you!  With your background, I bet you have a lot of great suggestions for movies, some of them fairly off the beaten path. I'll have to rely upon you for suggestions I think!  ### Speaker B: If you want more suggestions, just let me know! Just tell me what kind of movie you're looking for and I'll give you suggestions! ### Speaker A: I like all types of movies really. It mostly depends on the mood I'm in at the time.  I'm almost always in the mood for a good comedy though! ### Speaker B: Well then you gotta check out Coming 2 America! It has Eddie Murphy in it. I'd recommend seeing the Coming to America first if you haven't seen it. But the second one was just released within the year and is very funny! ### Speaker A: I did see the first one and I loved it! I didn't realize there was a sequel! I definitely have to put that on my list!  ' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it!
