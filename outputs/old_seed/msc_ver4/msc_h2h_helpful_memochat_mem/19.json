Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B enjoys painting and taking naps, but is not entirely satisfied with their current job and wishes it was more rewarding. They have a government job that pays the bills but dreams of working in interior design. Speaker B also feels conflicted about their government job, likening it to having tenure as a college professor.\n\nSpeaker A recently moved to a new city and has two older brothers. The change in location has made job searching challenging for Speaker A, who hopes to settle in the new city soon with a steady income. They are currently preparing for an upcoming interview and feeling nervous about it.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Hobbies and Job Satisfaction', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker B discusses hobbies, job satisfaction, and aspirations in interior design.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: You'll do great! Don't sweat it too much. Eh, you know I don't love my job, but it pays the bills. I kind of wish I could work in interior design since I like painting. But THAT wouldn't pay the bills. ### Speaker A: Yeah i know that feeling the things we have passion wont help us in terms of money, but producing horror movies i'm sure you love that job, all people love horror movies ### Speaker B: That's not true, haha! My sister hates them! She won't get anywhere near us when my dad is working on a film.  ### Speaker A: I love watching horror movies with those people i would feel a little better as they are more scared than me. Have you worked in big budget hollywood horror movies ### Speaker B: No, my dad is kind of small potatoes. If he hears about a good project, he'll work with it, but he's never been on a major film. It's more of a side hobby than an actual career for him. ### Speaker A: Seems like a good hobby i wish you would grow big to produce movies like the conjuring ### Speaker B: You never know! It's possible if he gets himself attached to a big-budget script. But for now we're content with smaller projects. At least it gives him more free time to fish!' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time?

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides detailed insights into Speaker B's government job, dissatisfaction, and dream to work in interior design, which directly answers the question asked by Speaker A about pursuing creative and fulfilling work. It also briefly mentions painting as a hobby, which could be relevant if Speaker B considers pursuing it creatively. While MEMORY 2 discusses Speaker B's job satisfaction and aspirations, it doesn't expand on their current job situation, feelings, or other creative outlets they might be interested in, making MEMORY 1 more directly helpful.\n\nChoice: 1"
