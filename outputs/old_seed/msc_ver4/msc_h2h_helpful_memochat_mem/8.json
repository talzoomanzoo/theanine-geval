I think my grandpa used to get indigestion when they first got together so she toned it down. I learned a couple on my own though. ### Speaker A: Well, I just know they are always so fantastic. What was it like growing up?  Did she always fix huge meals when you visited? ### Speaker B: Yep. She was definitely the matriarch and kept us together with family dinners. Whenever we'd go over, it would be about 12 of us, with my parents, uncles and aunts, and two of my cousins. We'd pitch in in different ways but grandma was the boss. Come to think of it, I'm not sure I ever visited her and not smelled something in the kitchen as soon as we got in. That garlic chicken especially was a staple.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it?
