Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\nSpeaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it.\nSpeaker A: Cool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot. What is your favorite part about camping?\nSpeaker B: I love being out in the wilderness and sleeping under the stars in the fresh air. It makes you realize how beautiful life is and how small we really are in comparison to the universe.\nSpeaker A: I miss doing that! I have done lots of picnics with my family but it's been a long time since I've slept in a tent! Looking forward to it again when the kids are older. Where was the last place you went?\nSpeaker B: We went up to an island in the middle of nowhere in Canada. There were lots of bears and huge moose!\nSpeaker A: Wow, that sounds like such an adventure! I love to visit Canada. I have seen moose but never a bear! That must have been scary! \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout. Speaker A is involved in church activities and mentioned a church retreat.

But I love it.  I want triplets the next time!  I want enough kids to start my own choir! ### Speaker B: That's a lot of kids! But since you love the church so much having enough for a church choir sounds like a good idea! Have you had any luck finding volunteers? When is your next retreat? ### Speaker A: We've gotten some volunteers, but always need more!  Thank you for getting your scout troop involved.  We are having another retreat next month.  It'll be a youth retreat if you and your friends would be interested. ### Speaker B: That sounds like a great idea! I could use some of my vacation days at work and we could come to the retreat! ### Speaker A: They are always worth the time.  So spiritually uplifting!  I'll be having to bring the babies along, so I hope they won't fuss too much. ### Speaker B: I'm sure they will be just fine. They are probably going to be little angels. ### Speaker A: I think they can read each other's minds.  It always looks like they are plotting something! haha ### Speaker B: I've heard that twins are connected in ways that most siblings aren't. Something about them sharing a womb and all that. I would not doubt the possiblities. ### Speaker A: How's life going.
