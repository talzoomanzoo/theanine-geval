What was your experience like? ### Speaker B: I was a little nervous because of all the training and equiprments, but the guides I had in Hawaii were amazing.

I can't even imagine how amazing that would be.  ### Speaker B: You will love it. Once I did it the first time, I was hooked.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides a personal history and interests of Speaker B, such as their divorce, scuba diving, and plans to study neuroscience, which are unrelated to the current conversation about pet snakes and why Speaker B likes them. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 contains direct references to Speaker B's snakes, including their names and a previous conversation about them, making it specifically helpful for responding to the topic being discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nChoice: 2"
