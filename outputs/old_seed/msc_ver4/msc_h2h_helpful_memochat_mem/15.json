Speaker B has two sick kitties and recently received a rescue, and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.

And good news, all kittens are feeling better and are healthy again. I love them. ### Speaker A: That's great news! Do you have any names picked out for them or are you going to keep their names? ### Speaker B: I do not have any names picked out for them yet. I have been trying to get to know their personalities better before I give them a name. Two of them are very spunky and one is shy. Maybe I will give them a Mandarin name! Do you have any recommendations as you are learning Mandarin? ### Speaker A: Hm, maybe Zhao for one of them! I always thought that name sounded cool ### Speaker B: Oh, how interesting! I have a friend who's surname is Zhao. What does Zhao mean in Mandarin? ### Speaker A: I believe it's just the name of a state, it doesn't really have a meaning.  ### Speaker B: Oh, okay. Are you able to adopt any cats since you have a parrot? I do not know if those two species get along. ### Speaker A: I can! My parrot would be fine with the extra friend, I would just need to train the kitten to see him as a friend rather than a foe, ha! ### Speaker B: I will pass on any training tips that I acquire as I train the new kittens. My older cat is so mellow that I have never had any issues training her. But two on the little kittens seem like they will be a handful to train.
