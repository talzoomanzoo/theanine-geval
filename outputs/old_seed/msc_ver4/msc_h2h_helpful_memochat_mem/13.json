Did they purr like household cats? ### Speaker A: They sure did! It was just much, much louder. It makes me wonder how your pups would react. ### Speaker B: I'm sure they'd be running the opposite way with their tails tucked if they saw a tiger. Haha. If you're talking about the music, than I'm sure they'd enjoy it and jump all over you. Are there any other animals you've tried playing to? ### Speaker A: Haha Journey and Sid have experienced quite a few home concerts! I'll have to invite you over one of these nights to witness it all. ### Speaker B: It sounds really fun!
