Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\nSpeaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach?\nSpeaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option.\nSpeaker A: Yes I think history is interesting, too! Both of those subjects would be great because there are probably lots of teaching jobs. What kind of history do you like?\nSpeaker B: I love all sorts of history. Right now I am really getting into the weeds of World War II. There's so much to unpack.\nSpeaker A: For sure! So much happened and it really affected how the world is today. I like learning about the history of places where I have lived, it's really interesting.\nSpeaker B: That sounds really cool! What have you learned about where you currently live?\nSpeaker A: Oh, I found out that the big sports field used to be a farm where they grew wheat and raised cows! It's really cool to see places in old photos and see how they have changed. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. Speaker B mentions feeling limited in job opportunities and is studying linguistics. Speaker A is studying computer science and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth, as well as being interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Teaching and Career Paths', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B explore the idea of teaching and career options related to their fields.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: Yup I already volunteer at my mom's after school program.

There is a lot of opportunity in this field and being able to teach it can really help advance my expertise. ### Speaker B: Yeah I feel like you could do so much with a computer science degree. It's really cool there are so many options! I feel a little bit stuck studying linguistics.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides detailed information on Speaker B's consideration of a master's degree and becoming a college professor, which relates directly to Speaker B's interest in teaching and expanding career options. Additionally, it mentions both speakers' fields of study, which could help contextualize the conversation about teaching career paths. MEMORY 2 includes relevant topics on teaching and career options but lacks the specific information about Speaker B's consideration of advanced education and potential career paths, making MEMORY 1 more relevant and useful in this context.\n\nChoice: 1"
