Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her?\nSpeaker B: Hi there, hope you are wlll and managing to save up for your Italy trip?  Thank for asking about the Greek mythology study, we are doing very well. It helps because i am so passionate about it and hope to get to the Greek islands soon\nSpeaker A: Yes I have been saving up for another trip to Italy! I can't wait. It's planned for next Spring. Do you have any plans to go back to Italy in the future?\nSpeaker B: I would love to get back to Italy but need to save up and the hopeful priority is to Greece this year.  You have friends in Europe are you in contact to see what plans you can make?\nSpeaker A: Yes I've been talking to them quite a bit so they know what's going on. I'll be staying with some of them while I'm over there. I have never been to Greece....I'd like to go though. Maybe I'll add it to my itinerary! Maybe we could plan to be in Greece at the same time?!\nSpeaker B: That would be so good.  There is so much history and the roman statues i take my daughter to see in the museums and through our local resources is fab.  She is building up the passion which is lovely to see.  Have you still got your hair blue or has it grown out now?\nSpeaker A: That's awesome! Maybe you can teach me a little about all the mythology. I think I've never liked it before only because I didn't understand it. My hair is back to being its natural brown - lol I'm being boring for the moment.\nSpeaker B: Never boring you will keep styling it all sorts of interesting styles im sure.  Yes i would be lovely to be your guide for the day out in Greece.  Bring some decent walking boots and some sun cream, its a different heat out there but your tan is probably topped up with going to the beach each day.\nSpeaker A: That's good advice! Thank you! I saw on the news Cali has been getting a lot of rain. Have you still been able to run on the beach each day? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B has been to Italy in the past and enjoyed the food there, while Speaker A is fascinated by the architecture of Italy and enjoys studying history, especially through reading and watching documentaries.\n\nSpeaker A is planning to travel to Italy alone for Spring Break and has friends from Europe meeting up with them, while Speaker B does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology. Speaker B appreciates the idea of superhuman powers and is interested in historical events that involve such figures.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Greek Mythology', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B talk about Greek mythology, specifically Poseidon and historical interest', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: Oh that's awesome. Did you major in History at school? ### Speaker A: No, but I took a history class or two before I dropped out. I read a lot about history, though, and watch a lot of documentaries on the History Channel. I guess that only place that would be better to visit to study history would be Greece.  ### Speaker B: Ah fair enough. What kind of history are you into? I really enjoy Greek mythology. I did a case study on Poseidon once. ### Speaker A: Really? I don't even know what a case study is. lol! Is that like a further in-depth study? Wasn't he God of the Sea or something like that? ### Speaker B: Yes, it is essentially a study based on a few accounts from all the way back in that time. I compiled that information and made a study on how he contributed to the aid of Zeus at the time. He is the God of the Sea, Earthquakes, and Horses. ### Speaker A: He's a busy guy! lol! I guess I haven't ever been able to get into Greek mythology because it's just that - mythology. Real historical accounts, people, and ruins have always fascinated me much more.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing?
