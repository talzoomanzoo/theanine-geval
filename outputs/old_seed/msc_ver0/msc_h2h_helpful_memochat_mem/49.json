Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon?\nSpeaker A: Yes!  As a matter of fact, I'm visiting my son that lives in Spain next month.  This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now!\nSpeaker B: Oh nice. You must be looking forward to it. He must have told you a lot about her. Do you think you would like her?\nSpeaker A: I think so.  She seems like a very sweet girl and she seems to care deeply about my son, so that's what matters most.  You know, maybe I can stop by and visit you as well, since you live in Europe.  France, Spain, Italy?  Where are you living now?\nSpeaker B: Bless her, that's good to hear. That would be great! I live in Portugal. It's not too far from Spain. We can always arrange something. How long would you be there for?\nSpeaker A: I'm planning to stay in Spain for three weeks.  Since you live in Portugal, I'd love to stop by for a visit if you're free this coming month.  I've always wanted to visit Lisbon.  It has the world's longest bridge!\nSpeaker B: That'a great idea. We have a holiday house just outside of Lisbon. You are welcome to lodge with us.\nSpeaker A: Sounds great!  I'm already very excited about my trip to Spain, and now I get to visit you in Lisbon!  I need to brush up on my Spanish and also start studying Portuguese.\nSpeaker B: Haha, you've got your hands full then. Portuguese would be easier I believe. Spanish is a bit harder because it is spoken quicker. Would you be travelling with any company? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A has two sons who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next. Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe.\nSpeaker A has multiple sons, at least one of them is in a relationship with a Spanish girlfriend. Speaker B has two sons, one of whom has had a girlfriend for several years and the other is secretive. \nSpeaker B's younger son would be jealous of Speaker A's sons' European tour. Speaker B's sons would possibly get along well with Speaker A's sons.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Son's Spanish Girlfriend', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A discusses his son's new Spanish girlfriend.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: My younger son would be so jealous.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides more relevant information related to the current context of the conversation. It includes specific topics about Speaker A's son with a Spanish girlfriend and the meeting plans between Speaker A and Speaker B. This aligns well with the current discussion, where Speaker A talks about visiting his son in Spain and possibly meeting up with Speaker B in Lisbon. On the other hand, MEMORY 1 provides broader context about the sons' activities in Europe but lacks the specific details of meeting plans or the discussion on the son's Spanish girlfriend, which are key subjects of the recent dialogue.\n\nChoice: 2"
