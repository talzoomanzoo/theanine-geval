If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice.  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B mentions living in a rural area with a farm and being able to relate to cooking. Speaker A also talks about primarily cooking Indian food and baking rice dishes. Additionally, Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work. \n\nSpeaker A enjoys cooking and baking, and is considering turning it into a business. Speaker B mentions having a farm with animals like chickens, ducks, pigs, and goats, as well as growing crops like corn, strawberries, and pumpkins. This resonates with Speaker A, who owns a farm and also enjoys cooking and baking. This has led Speaker A to become a cook who uses a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n\nSpeaker B's rural lifestyle and farming background have sparked Speaker A's interest in running a business with their cooking skills. Speaker B, who is not a cook, is intrigued and wants to learn more about cooking with a pressure cooker.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Pressure Cooker and Cooking Tips', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A explains the use of a pressure cooker in cooking and provides tips on its benefits, recipes, and recommendations.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: What a tandoor? Is it similar to a pressure cooker? ### Speaker A: No, a tandoor is a special type of oven which they use in India to make tandoori chicken. It helps give it its flavour. It is made from clay. ### Speaker B: Oh I see! I've never used a pressure cooker before. Does it cook other things other than lentils? I hear it makes the cooking go much faster. ### Speaker A: Yes, you can do lots of things in pressure cookers like stews and soups. Most of the time, I use it to soften meat. I love putting my lamb shanks in there. It makes the meat fall right off the bone. Do you have a pressure cooker? ### Speaker B: I don't, but hearing what you're saying makes me want to purchase one for my husband. He's an avid cook but sometimes that makes the cooking process a lot longer than I want! ### Speaker A: I would recommend a pressure cooker. It is a great item for beginner cooks. You throw it all in, pop the lid on and wait for the whistle really. I gave one to my sister for Christmas and she uses more often than me now.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try.
