Thank you for the recommendation.\nSpeaker B: Of course. I recommend that movie to everyone I meet. I think I've watched it over one hundred times. So what is the next movie on your list to watch soon?\nSpeaker A: Yeah it was great and I will also recommend to people when they ask what movie is good. So next is another one you recommended which is coming to America. What’s the next movie your going to watch? \nSpeaker B: There is a horror genre movie that was released just this week which I'm going to watch tonight. It is called \"Girl Next.\"\nSpeaker A: Oh that sounds interesting, I will look into that and put it on my list. How has your job been going? Is there where you get all these great ideas for what to watch?  \nSpeaker B: My Film Studies professor job has been going absolutely great lately. I love all my students, because they really get into the lectures and ask lots of questions. Yes, my job requires me to watch movies all the time, so that is how I find the best ones. Is your programmer job going all right lately?\nSpeaker A: That sounds amazing. Super lucky to have students that really enjoy what they are learning about and I’m sure that’s down to the way you teach and what you teach them. I’m so glad it is all going well for you. Yeah it is going much better now, I’m really getting in the swing of things thank you for asking. \nSpeaker B: You're welcome. So, returning to the subject of Pulp Fiction, did you think it was funny? Did you think it was too violent for kids to watch?\nSpeaker A: Yeah there was some funny parts in that movie. I kinda think it may be a little to violent for kids, but I would just allow it to each parent to decide I would probably let my grandkids watch. What is your opinion? \nSpeaker B: I agree with you. As long as the parent can explain what's going on regarding the violence, and make sure the kid knows it is just a movie and not real life, I think most kids would be able to watch the movie without really being harmed or negatively influenced. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B, who has kids and enjoys watching movies with them, used to teach Film Studies and carefully chooses what movies to watch. Speaker B, who just turned 40 and considers themselves too old for certain activities, allowed their kids to watch Disney, Pixar, and older films like screwball comedies from the '30s and '40s, causing Speaker B to recommend \"Coming 2 America\" and \"I-SPY\" starring Eddie Murphy.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Movie Preferences', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker B shares about his love for movies and his viewing habits.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: So what kind of movies do you usually watch? ### Speaker B: Lots of different things. I used to teach Film Studies with a creative arts conservatory, so I chose what I watch carefully. I mostly follow the films of directors I like... ### Speaker A: Do you have any particular favorite genres? ### Speaker B: I like suspense films, action, SF, horror, westerns, drama, an occasional good comedy.... ### Speaker A: That's cool! Do you like to watch any movies with your kids? ### Speaker B: When the kids were young, they got Disney and Pixar of course, but I also let them watch older films, like the screwball comedies from the '30s and '40s. They just love them.

I'm leaning towards Pulp Fiction, have you ever seen it? ### Speaker B: Oh yes. It's a classic. It has so many great actors and actresses. The whole movie is amazing. Have you seen it before? ### Speaker A: No, I haven't. I think Uma Thurman looks so exotic though.  It just sounds like a very unique kind of movie. I'm not sure why I've never watched it before. ### Speaker B: Wow! I don't want to make you feel too bad for not seeing it after all this time. But I must encourage you to go see it as soon as possible! I can't spoil it for you. You'll love it! ### Speaker A: Thank you!  With your background, I bet you have a lot of great suggestions for movies, some of them fairly off the beaten path. I'll have to rely upon you for suggestions I think!  ### Speaker B: If you want more suggestions, just let me know! Just tell me what kind of movie you're looking for and I'll give you suggestions! ### Speaker A: I like all types of movies really. It mostly depends on the mood I'm in at the time.  I'm almost always in the mood for a good comedy though! ### Speaker B: Well then you gotta check out Coming 2 America! It has Eddie Murphy in it. I'd recommend seeing the Coming to America first if you haven't seen it. But the second one was just released within the year and is very funny! ### Speaker A: I did see the first one and I loved it! I didn't realize there was a sequel! I definitely have to put that on my list!  ' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it!
