    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself!\nSpeaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food?\nSpeaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too?\nSpeaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also?\nSpeaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways?\nSpeaker B: They've been better as I left my previous job so I'm spending more time with them, how do you manage to work full time and still keep those animals happy?\nSpeaker A: I think working at the zoo so long has helped. Why did you leave your last job. Was that the one you were working in the warehouse? Sorry to hear about your dogs, it can be hard managing older animals.\nSpeaker B: Yea, that totally makes sense! I just wanted time off to spend with the dogs and look for a better job elsewhere, I'm hoping that I'll be able to get a job outside of a warehouse!\nSpeaker A: That is understandable. I didn't always think I would end up a zookeeper. Do you have anything in mind?\nSpeaker B: Well, I really enjoy animals so I might think of applying to work in a zoo aswell! Is it a super busy job?\nSpeaker A: That sounds like a great idea! You would be surprised how busy it can be. Not every job is high demanding and you don't have to work with all the animals either. Is there anything you don't like to do? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A enjoys working with animals at the zoo, including penguins, and offers Speaker B a chance to help out. Speaker B, who has two terrier dogs as pets, is excited about the opportunity at the zoo and is looking for a new job. Speaker A is willing to help Speaker B get an entry-level position at the zoo, mentioning that it involves cleaning enclosures and feeding less dangerous animals but offers decent pay, training, benefits, and assistance with schooling.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nSpeaker A is a zookeeper who loves animals, particularly the white tiger. They have a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid. Speaker A enjoys playing music for animals and has a playful and caring nature.\n\nRelationship Description:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B share a friendly and supportive relationship. Speaker A offered to help Speaker B secure a position at the zoo, showing kindness and generosity. Speaker B expressed gratitude and excitement for the opportunity, leading to a humorous exchange about starting with less dangerous animals for music playing.\n\nEvent Description:\nSpeaker A tried playing music for the white tigers at the zoo, which they enjoyed. Speaker A also mentioned bringing out the guitar for a pet concert with Speaker B's dogs in the future. Speaker B expressed interest in a playdate for their terriers and Speaker A's raccoon, showcasing a shared love for animals and a potential bonding opportunity. Speaker B shared their aspiration of taking a Disney cruise and their relaxed attitude towards finding a new job, highlighting their adventurous spirit. Speaker A received a baby raccoon from a friend and had a heartwarming experience letting the raccoons play together, demonstrating their caring nature.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is focused on Speaker B's interest in potentially working in a zoo and seeking advice from Speaker A about it.
