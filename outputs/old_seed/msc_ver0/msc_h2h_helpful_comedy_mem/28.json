Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \nSpeaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along!\nSpeaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A, a country girl who loves animals and is a lacto-ovo vegetarian, has a pet named Tasha who speaks Mandarin. Speaker B, who lives in the city they grew up in and loves animals, has two sick kitties and recently received a rescue kitten. Speaker A, with a pet parrot named Tasha and red hair that makes them stand out, is interested in adopting a rescue kitten despite having a parrot.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description: Speaker A is a country girl with red hair who loves animals, particularly their pet parrot named Tasha. They are a locto-ovo vegetarian and enjoy hiking. Speaker A is planning a trip to China and wants to visit New York City first.\n\nRelationship Description: Speaker A and Speaker B have a friendly and intimate relationship, sharing stories about their pets and discussing travel plans together. They show concern for each other's animals and are open to adopting rescue kittens.\n\nEvent Description: Speaker A is planning to visit Speaker B and stay for a couple of days. They discuss bringing their parrot, Tasha, and are willing to adopt one of Speaker B's rescue kittens. Speaker A also shares that Tasha speaks Mandarin and has picked up the language from them.

Speaker B has a playful sense of humor, suggesting the parrot could teach the kittens Mandarin.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 directly addresses Speaker A's parrot, Tasha, that can speak Mandarin, which is relevant to the last utterance where Speaker A mentions the parrot in the context of watching the kittens. MEMORY 2, while also relevant, contains more extraneous information about travel and hiking that is not pertinent to the current dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 1"
