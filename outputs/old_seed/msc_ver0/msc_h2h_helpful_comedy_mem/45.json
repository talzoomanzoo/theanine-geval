Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\nSpeaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B is involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout. \nSpeaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat. \nSpeaker B is considering attending a local community college for the first couple of years.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description: Speaker B works at a fast food place and loves ice cream. Speaker B hasn't started college yet but hopes to become an Eagle Scout. Speaker B uses scouts to make friends and has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years. \n\nRelationship Description: Speaker B is interested in volunteering at Speaker A's church and has done a lot of volunteer work in Boy Scouts. Speaker B wants to come to the church retreat and thinks twins are little angels. \n\nEvent Description: Speaker A manages work, school, and scouts.

Speaker B's work is going well, and the hardest part is managing scouts, work, and school. Speaker B plans to attend the local community college and get his Eagle Scout badge.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The MEMORY 2 provides comprehensive information about Speaker B's involvement in Boy Scouts, which aligns with the context of discussing the benefits and activities within scouting. It mentions Speaker B's aspirations of becoming an Eagle Scout and their experience over 7-8 years, which is directly relevant and useful to the discussion about survival skills and social skills gained through scouting. MEMORY 1, while mentioning Speaker B's involvement for 7-8 years and being a Life Scout, lacks the additional context provided in MEMORY 2 about aspirations and experiences that could enrich the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 2"
