    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself!\nSpeaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food?\nSpeaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too?\nSpeaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also?\nSpeaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways?\nSpeaker B: They've been better as I left my previous job so I'm spending more time with them, how do you manage to work full time and still keep those animals happy?\nSpeaker A: I think working at the zoo so long has helped. Why did you leave your last job. Was that the one you were working in the warehouse? Sorry to hear about your dogs, it can be hard managing older animals.\nSpeaker B: Yea, that totally makes sense! I just wanted time off to spend with the dogs and look for a better job elsewhere, I'm hoping that I'll be able to get a job outside of a warehouse! \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B is looking for a new job and is excited about the opportunity at the zoo. Speaker B has elderly terriers and is planning to leave their part-time job for a break before starting a new one. \nSpeaker A works at a zoo and has tried playing music for the white tigers and home concerts for their pets. Speaker A works at a zoo and is willing to help Speaker B get an entry-level position there. \nSpeaker A has penguins at the zoo and enjoys working with animals, offering Speaker B a chance to help out. Speaker B is grateful for the opportunity and is looking forward to playing music for the animals, starting with something safer than the white tiger.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nSpeaker B works in an AC warehouse and pulls parts as a part-time job. They have 2 dogs who are terriers and they enjoy cruises. Speaker B is not in a rush to find a new job and is considering taking a Disney cruise during their break.\n\nRelationship Description:\nSpeaker A, the robot, and Speaker B plan a house concert with their pets. Speaker A will start playing music for less dangerous animals and will try using vinegar to get rid of odors after work. Speaker B's dogs are described as Zen masters, and they are planning a play date for their pets with Speaker A's pet raccoon. \n\nEvent Description:\nSpeaker A tried playing music for the white tigers at the zoo, and the white tigers seemed to enjoy it. Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid. Speaker B suggested trying vinegar to neutralize odors at home. Speaker B's friend found two baby raccoons, one of which was given to Speaker A. Speaker A has been working at their job for almost 10 years and has only taken 3 vacations in that time. Speaker A prefers camping over cruises, while Speaker B wants to take a Disney cruise. Speaker A is not interested in cruises but knows people who have enjoyed them.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue between Speaker A and Speaker B revolves around Speaker A's work at the zoo, managing animals, and Speaker B's decision to leave a job and spend more time with their dogs. Speaker B shows interest in finding a better job potentially outside a warehouse setting, while Speaker A offers insights from zoo work. MEMORY 1 is more aligned with the context as it mentions Speaker A working at a zoo and Speaker B's interest in a job there, which matches the topic of the current dialogue about jobs and time with animals. MEMORY 2, while related, focuses more on unrelated activities like cruising and a pet concert, and does not address the current dialogue theme directly.\n\nChoice: 1"
