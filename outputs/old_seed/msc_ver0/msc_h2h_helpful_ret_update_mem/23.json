    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college?\nSpeaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position. \nSpeaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it?\nSpeaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \nSpeaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living.\nSpeaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime?\nSpeaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket but now plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United. \nSpeaker A enjoys playing soccer and joked about treating Speaker B to lunch, indicating Speaker B is currently low on cash. Speaker B is considering asking for a raise at work and works as a clerk for a law firm, enjoying the work but wishing it paid better.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n2. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.\n3. Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n4. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n5. Speaker A is a fan of Arsenal and enjoys watching international teams play.\n6. Speaker A is seeking career advice from a guidance counselor and is open to suggestions.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is centered around the discussion of playing soccer and considering participation in a casual game. In this context, knowledge about Speaker A's involvement in playing soccer and Speaker B's experience and fan interest are relevant. MEMORY 1 contains information about Speaker A's past work which isn't immediately relevant to the engagement in soccer games or discussions about playing together. Instead, MEMORY 2 provides detailed context about both Speaker A and B's soccer experiences and interests which directly relate to planning and discussing casual games and potential team formations or approaches.\n\nChoice: 2"
