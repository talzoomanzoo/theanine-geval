Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B's mom is a nurse and busy with work, which led Speaker B to become a therapist, mentioning the ups and downs of the profession. Speaker B is concerned about the cost of owning horses, including medical fees and expenses like horse shoes, and is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n\nSpeaker A is involved in horse breeding and taking care of horses, working at a stable and enjoying being around horses. Speaker A mentions that horses often hurt themselves while exercising, leading to potential medical costs.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n2. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n3. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n4. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n5. Speaker B is a professional in a practice, where it is illegal for them to have relationships with clients.\n6. Speaker A is married and has been for four years.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The last utterance from Speaker A comments on the potential difficulty of being a therapist because of the challenge in listening to people and providing the right advice. Both memories mention different aspects of Speaker B's profession and personal interests, but Memory 2 provides a direct context for responding, as it mentions Speaker B having their own practice for six years and being a professional where client relationships are illegal. These aspects directly connect to Speaker A's consideration of the difficulties in the therapist's role, making Speaker B's experience and professional environment more relevant to the conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
