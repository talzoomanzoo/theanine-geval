There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you?\nSpeaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions?\nSpeaker B: Unfortunately I mainly play games similar to RE. I don't know why I like them so much. I remember when I was little my brother play Doom and it gave me nightmares for a week. What genre of games you like?\nSpeaker A: I like all kinds of games. I like party, fighting, RPGs, shooters, action, adventure, and puzzle games. I enjoy playing Jurassic Park: World but I'd like to find another game to play. The storm means I'll be inside for a bit, so I think I'll curl up with some pizza and just zone out. Do you like to do anything else besides game when it's rainy?\nSpeaker B: Well, I might help around the house with cleaning or laundry, but not that much. Mostly gaming. If I feel I sat too long, I'll switch to Nintendo Switch's Ring Fit Adventure to get my body moving a bit. Do yo know that game?\nSpeaker A: I've heard of it. I think I need to get some exercise, so that might be a good idea. I'd like to stay in shape as much as I can. I guess games are the best way to do that! That's a good suggestion. How about you? Do you only like games like RE? What other genres do you like?\nSpeaker B: I like fighting too, but not RPG types. I tried racing games before, but clearly not good at it so I'm not enjoying them that much. \nSpeaker A: Maybe when you get the chance, we should play an online game together. I'm not a competitive person. I mainly play games for fun and I don't care if I win or lose. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: Sure! Do you have any suggestion for the game? I also not that competitive, which probably is the reason why I don't enjoy RPG types that much with all their groups and clans and ranks. I always thought RPG players are all these serious gamers.\nSpeaker A: Maybe we can a play fighting game like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat. It's a good way to pass the time. I've always wanted to learn martial arts myself.
