    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends?\nSpeaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do.\nSpeaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars.\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I think they go dark for a couple months and then have daylight for a couple months! I actually like night time, but having daylight all the time will make me crazy lol. Yeah I kind of hope it's dark for the camping but it will be very cold. I have heard Alaska has delicious ice cream. I want to try that while I'm there, \nSpeaker A: You'd have to get some serious blackout curtains for when it was daylight lol! You'll have to stock up on some warm essentials before heading out. You definitely don't want to get stuck in a bad situation in the cold, especially if you're alone. I bet they have great ice cream! You'll have to tell me about it when you get back!\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I need to call my friend and find out what season they are in so I can pack accordingly. I will take pictures of the ice cream too so I can tell you about it. I wonder if there are a lot of bears there? I don't like bears either. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing their upcoming trip to Alaska and planning activities together.\n- Speaker B is going to Alaska for a vacation in two weeks and has some experience with flying on airplanes. Speaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking. Speaker A mentions the outdoor activities they plan to do in Alaska, such as hiking.\n- Speaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet. Speaker A has the impression that Alaska is cold and snowy, wondering if there are ski slopes there.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A mentions the outdoor activities they plan to do in Alaska, such as hiking.\n2. Speaker B is unsure about what else there is to do in Alaska besides hiking.\n3. Speaker A has the impression that Alaska is cold and snowy, wondering if there are ski slopes there.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together.\n5. Speaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet.\n6. Speaker A mentions that Alaska has mountains and glaciers, unsure if skiing is possible there.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 contains more specific details about the perceptions of Alaska and mentions potential activities like skiing, which could be relevant to the discussion about packing appropriately for the cold and the interest in exploring outdoor activities. It also includes the notion of glaciers and mountains, which could be tied to the concern about bears, making it slightly more applicable to the discussion than MEMORY 1.\n\nChoice: 2"
