    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 provides specific relevant information about Speaker A having a pet raccoon named Journey, which directly relates to the dialogue context where Journey is mentioned. Memory 2 also mentions Journey but has additional unrelated content that could distract from the current dialogue context about pets and food access. However, Memory 2 specifies Speaker B's pets as terriers, which is directly relevant to Speaker A's question about Speaker B's dogs. Therefore, Memory 2 includes more relevant details for Speaker B to respond effectively about dogs and managing food access.\n\nChoice: 2"
