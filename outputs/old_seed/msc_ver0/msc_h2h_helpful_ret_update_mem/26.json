But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out!

How are your dogs doing anyways?\nSpeaker B: They've been better as I left my previous job so I'm spending more time with them, how do you manage to work full time and still keep those animals happy?\nSpeaker A: I think working at the zoo so long has helped. Why did you leave your last job. Was that the one you were working in the warehouse? Sorry to hear about your dogs, it can be hard managing older animals.\nSpeaker B: Yea, that totally makes sense!
