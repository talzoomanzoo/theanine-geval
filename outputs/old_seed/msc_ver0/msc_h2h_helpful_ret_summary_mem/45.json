Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\nSpeaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B is involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout. \nSpeaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat. \nSpeaker B is considering attending a local community college for the first couple of years.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat.\n2. Speaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout.\n3. Speaker B is a member of the boy scouts and works at a fast food place\n4. Speaker B plans to earn the Eagle Scout badge for college applications.\n5. Speaker B is busy with scouts, school, work, and tennis, but willing to take vacation days for the retreat.\n6. Speaker B is not yet in college but hopes to become an Eagle Scout.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context involves a discussion about Boy Scouts and the survival skills and social skills it imparts. Speaker A is interested in these aspects for their kids. Therefore, helpful memories would include information about Speaker B's experience and level of expertise with Boy Scouts, as this could provide credibility and further insight into the benefits of joining scouts.\n\nMEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 both mention Speaker B's level of involvement and current status with Boy Scouts, which are relevant to the dialogue. However, MEMORY 2 contains more detailed information about Speaker B's involvement with the Boy Scouts, including the intention to earn the Eagle Scout badge and balancing numerous activities, which could add additional context and credibility to their suggestion that Speaker A's kids should join. This additional detail in MEMORY 2 about Speaker B's deep engagement and responsibility might reassure Speaker A about the positive impact of Boy Scouts.\n\nChoice: 2"
