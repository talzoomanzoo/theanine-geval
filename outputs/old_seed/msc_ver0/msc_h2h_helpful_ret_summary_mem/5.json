    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is asking about Speaker B's decision to become a therapist. Therefore, the MEMORY that provides information relevant to Speaker B's journey as a therapist, including aspects such as the duration of their practice and possibly influences from other interests or fields, would be most helpful. MEMORY 1 mentions both Speaker A's involvement with horses and Speaker B's work as a therapist, as well as aspirations related to city living and horses and their support for a football team, which could speak to personal interests that might have influenced their career choice. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 detailed several aspects of Speaker B's professional life and other considerations, but lacks specific elements that might directly answer Speaker A's question about becoming a therapist.\n\nChoice: 1"
