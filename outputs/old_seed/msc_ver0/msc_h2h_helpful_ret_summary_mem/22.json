    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is asking specifically about what position Speaker A played when playing soccer in college. While both memories provide information about Speaker A's current position as a striker, MEMORY 2 includes a concrete answer by mentioning Speaker A plays as a striker. All other details like the employment history or college major are not directly relevant to the position question. MEMORY 2 is slightly more helpful because it organizes the relevant responses clearly, while MEMORY 1 mixes it with less relevant information.\n\nChoice: 2"
