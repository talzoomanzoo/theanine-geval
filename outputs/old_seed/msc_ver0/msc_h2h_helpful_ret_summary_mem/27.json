    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself!\nSpeaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food?\nSpeaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too?\nSpeaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also?\nSpeaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways?\nSpeaker B: They've been better as I left my previous job so I'm spending more time with them, how do you manage to work full time and still keep those animals happy?\nSpeaker A: I think working at the zoo so long has helped. Why did you leave your last job. Was that the one you were working in the warehouse? Sorry to hear about your dogs, it can be hard managing older animals.\nSpeaker B: Yea, that totally makes sense! I just wanted time off to spend with the dogs and look for a better job elsewhere, I'm hoping that I'll be able to get a job outside of a warehouse!\nSpeaker A: That is understandable. I didn't always think I would end up a zookeeper. Do you have anything in mind?\nSpeaker B: Well, I really enjoy animals so I might think of applying to work in a zoo aswell! Is it a super busy job?\nSpeaker A: That sounds like a great idea! You would be surprised how busy it can be. Not every job is high demanding and you don't have to work with all the animals either. Is there anything you don't like to do? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A enjoys working with animals at the zoo, including penguins, and offers Speaker B a chance to help out. Speaker B, who has two terrier dogs as pets, is excited about the opportunity at the zoo and is looking for a new job. Speaker A is willing to help Speaker B get an entry-level position at the zoo, mentioning that it involves cleaning enclosures and feeding less dangerous animals but offers decent pay, training, benefits, and assistance with schooling.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A has penguins at the zoo and enjoys working with animals, offering Speaker B a chance to help out.\n2. Speaker A works at a zoo and is willing to help Speaker B get an entry-level position there.\n3. Speaker B is looking for a new job and is excited about the opportunity at the zoo.\n4. Speaker A mentions that entry-level positions at the zoo involve cleaning enclosures and feeding less dangerous animals but offer decent pay, training, benefits, and assistance with schooling.\n5. Speaker A works as a zookeeper and loves animals, especially white tigers.\n6. Speaker A works at a zoo and has tried playing music for the white tigers and home concerts for their pets.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nIn this dialogue, Speaker A inquires if there's anything Speaker B dislikes doing as they consider working at a zoo. The relevant and helpful information would include specific zoo-related job details, including any potential support Speaker A could provide. Both Memory 1 and Memory 2 provide relevant details regarding job duties and opportunities at the zoo, but Memory 1 also mentions that Speaker B has two terrier dogs as pets, which aligns with the ongoing conversation about dogs. While neither Memory is perfect, this additional context about the dogs in Memory 1 could make it somewhat more relevant due to its coherence with the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 1"
