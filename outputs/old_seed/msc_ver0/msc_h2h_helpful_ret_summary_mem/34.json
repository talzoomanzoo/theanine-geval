Speaker A is planning to take their clients salsa dancing for fun.\n6. Speaker A plans to grab dinner with their brother before dancing.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The question from Speaker B is about the plot of the Black Widow movie, and Speaker A's interest in Brazilian foods was already mentioned. Thus, knowing Speaker A's affinity for Brazilian steakhouse dinners and their brother's fondness for Brazilian food is more directly relevant to the conversation about Brazilian foods than any bartending or dancing background. MEMORY 2 provides this relevant detail that can guide a response incorporating Brazilian food experiences, though it still does not directly address the movie plot question.\n\nChoice: 2"
