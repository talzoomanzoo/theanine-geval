    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\nSpeaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach?\nSpeaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option.\nSpeaker A: Yes I think history is interesting, too! Both of those subjects would be great because there are probably lots of teaching jobs. What kind of history do you like?\nSpeaker B: I love all sorts of history. Right now I am really getting into the weeds of World War II. There's so much to unpack.\nSpeaker A: For sure! So much happened and it really affected how the world is today. I like learning about the history of places where I have lived, it's really interesting.\nSpeaker B: That sounds really cool! What have you learned about where you currently live?\nSpeaker A: Oh, I found out that the big sports field used to be a farm where they grew wheat and raised cows! It's really cool to see places in old photos and see how they have changed. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. Speaker B mentions feeling limited in job opportunities and is studying linguistics. Speaker A is studying computer science and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth, as well as being interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\n3. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n4. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n5. Speaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\n6. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides relevant details about Speaker A's computer science and robotics teaching interests, which is connected to the dialogue where Speaker A expresses an interest in teaching robotics. It also mentions Speaker B's consideration of a masters degree and college professorship in linguistics, which ties in with Speaker B's ongoing journey of choosing between teaching English or history. However, MEMORY 2 repeats similar information but adds extra unrelated details, like Speaker A working at a pizza shop. This detail dilutes the focus, making MEMORY 1 more concise and pertinent.\n\nChoice: 1"
