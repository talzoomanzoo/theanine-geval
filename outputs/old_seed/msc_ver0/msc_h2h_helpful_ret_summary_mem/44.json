Ha!\nSpeaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes?\nSpeaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe. \nSpeaker A: You make them sounds so fascinating. Will you take them with you to your college dorm? \nSpeaker B: I'll be living off campus, so absolutely. How about you? Are you staying in the dorms?\nSpeaker A: I'm glad your taking them with you. My mum wants me to stay in dorms. But I think I just want my own place, less drama and more freedom that way. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A is a student planning to go to college next year and wants to study neuroscience.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 contains specific information that ties back to the last utterance in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically regarding Speaker B's interest in studying marine life or different animals, which could relate to their educational and living arrangements discussed in the context. This also adds context to Speaker B's lifestyle choice and preferences, enhancing the conversation about college life and living situations.
