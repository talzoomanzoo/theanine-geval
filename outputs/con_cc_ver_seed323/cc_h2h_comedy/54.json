    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are consistent with the past memories, as they align with the supportive and encouraging attitude displayed by Co-worker B towards Co-worker A's efforts to be more responsible. Response 2 expands on Co-worker A's journey by acknowledging their resilience and highlights past difficulties, which is consistent with the memories of their struggles, breakup, and leadership experiences. Response 1 is also consistent but does not elaborate as much on the specific journey Co-worker A has been on. Therefore, both responses are consistent in context, but Response 2 offers a richer acknowledgment of Co-worker A's progress.\n\nChoice: tie"
