    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are consistent with the past memories in that they offer support and guidance to the Mentee, showing empathy and understanding, which is the Mentor's established approach. However, Response 1 focuses on encouraging the Mentee to be themselves and open to experiences, aligning with the aim of making an impact and inspiring others.

Both responses are consistent and appropriate, but Response 2 provides a specific actionable suggestion that doesn't contradict past memories and offers practical steps for social integration.\n\nChoice: 2"
