    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 is consistent with the past memories as it aligns with the advice and supportive attitude Classmate B has shown Classmate A previously, by encouraging them to seek help when needed. It also shows Classmate A acknowledging the need for help with financial struggles, which resonates with their past openness to guidance from Classmate B. \n\nResponse 2 contains a contradiction. Classmate A is speaking as if they are Classmate B, addressing themselves in the second person (\"You were facing financial difficulties\"), which is inconsistent with the current conversation where Classmate A is admitting fault to Classmate B.\n\nChoice: 1"
