Just remember, you're not alone in this transition.\nRESPONSE 2\nMentor: It's completely normal to feel that way when you're in a new place. Remember, building new friendships takes time and effort.

    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are consistent with the past memories as they acknowledge the Mentee's current feelings of loneliness in the new city where they took a job. Neither response contradicts past memories, and both provide reassurance to the Mentee. However, Response 1 slightly edges out Response 2 in terms of consistency with the mentor's supportive role by explicitly stating that the Mentee is \"not alone in this transition,\" which aligns well with the mentor's behavior of providing reassurance as seen in past memories.\n\nChoice: 1"
