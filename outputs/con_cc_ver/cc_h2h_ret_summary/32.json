    "prediction": "Explanation: The consistency criterion requires that the response aligns with past memories and fits appropriately within the current conversation without introducing contradictions. Response 1 discusses work stress and personal issues, which is a reasonable explanation for being frustrated but doesn't directly connect with any of the shared memories. Response 2 aligns better with past memories, particularly Neighbor A's detail-oriented nature and tendency to strive for perfection, as well as emphasizing appreciation and gratitude, which are inherent themes in their relationship.\n\nChoice: 2"
