    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 2 includes information that contradicts the past memories. It incorrectly implies that Co-worker A sang the solo, but it was Co-worker B who sang. Additionally, Co-worker A is not known for having a talent for singing, as mentioned in response 2, which contradicts the focus on their talent for solving mysteries and puzzles. Response 1, however, is an appropriate response from Co-worker B, who acknowledges the event and asks for further details without introducing any inconsistencies.\n\nChoice: 1"
