    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses acknowledge the mentee's loneliness and address the need to build a new support system. However, Response 2 is more consistent with past memories as it aligns the advice with the mentee's established advocacy work for gender equality, suggesting community involvement as a potential solution, which can help them connect with like-minded individuals. It also reinforces the mentor's role of guidance and support, which is consistent with their past interactions. Response 1, while offering empathy and reassurance, is more generic and doesn't connect to past shared experiences or the mentee's interests.\n\nChoice: 2"
