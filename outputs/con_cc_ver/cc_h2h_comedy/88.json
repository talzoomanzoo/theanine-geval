    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses deal with the financial struggle mentioned in the conversation, however, Response 2 seems to inaccurately flip the speakers, as Classmates A was caught cheating and Classmates B is the one responding. Furthermore, Response 2 contradicts past memories where Classmate A is portrayed as someone who believes in hard work and dedication, and not someone who would typically resort to cheating. Hence, Response 1 is more consistent as it acknowledges regret and aligns more closely with the established memories of Classmate A's character.\n\nChoice: 1"
