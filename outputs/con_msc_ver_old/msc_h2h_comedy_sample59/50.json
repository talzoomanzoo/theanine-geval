    "prediction": "Explanation: \nBoth responses are consistent with past memories. Response 1 acknowledges Speaker A's positive experiences with horses and invites Speaker A to consider therapy without pressuring them. There is no mention of Speaker A being a current client, which aligns with the fact that Speaker B cannot have relationships with clients. Response 2 also allows for the personalized aspect of therapy and acknowledges Speaker A's finding of support in their horses. It explains that therapy can have an endpoint and offers support. Both responses fit within the legal and ethical boundaries mentioned in the past memories and do not contradict the information provided.\n\nChoice: tie"
