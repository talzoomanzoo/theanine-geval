    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 1 does not directly address the specific request for a motivational speaker and provides a vague promise to \"let me check and get back to you,\" which shows less enthusiasm and does not align as closely with the motivational aspect of Speaker B's character. On the other hand, Response 2 acknowledges the successful speech, directly addresses the request for a motivational speaker, and provides an encouraging, motivational message in line with Speaker B's profession and personality as a motivational speaker. There's no inconsistency with the previous memories, as Speaker B is a motivational speaker, and providing such information is within their expertise.\n\nChoice: 2"
