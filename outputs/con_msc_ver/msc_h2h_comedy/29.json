Looking forward to it!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 1 is consistent because Speaker A talks about trying new foods, aligning with their enjoyment of cooking and making new dishes. The mention of spicy shrimp tacos fits with their known liking for cooking and spicy food, and there is no contradiction in the information about the \"recently tried\" part. Response 2, however, contains inconsistencies. Speaker A incorrectly mentions cooking their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe, which violates consistency since it is Speaker B's grandmother who has a famous garlic chicken recipe. Furthermore, Response 2 doesn't address the question about any new foods Speaker A has tried lately and shifts the focus to cooking together, which deviates from the current conversation context.\n\nChoice: 1"
