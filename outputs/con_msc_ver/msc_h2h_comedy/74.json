You should definitely get your kids into it.\nSpeaker A: Cool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot.

However, Response 2 is slightly more consistent in its encouragement for Speaker A to take children camping in the future, aligning with Speaker A's interest in such activities for the kids.\n\nChoice: 2"
