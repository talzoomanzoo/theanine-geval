    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are not directly contradicted by past memories, as there are no details about a specific movie adaptation status of a book that Speaker A is reading. However, Response 1 presents a currently existing movie adaptation, which could contradict the scenario of a new book without known adaptations, whereas Response 2 leaves open the possibility of a future adaptation without asserting a current adaptation. This makes Response 2 slightly more consistent as it aligns with Speaker A's known situation of currently reading a book like this without contradicting any past information.\n\nChoice: 2"
