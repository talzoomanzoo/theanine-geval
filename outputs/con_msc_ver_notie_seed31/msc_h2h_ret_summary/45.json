Just be careful with your own physical activities, especially with soccer and surfing. Your health is important too.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are consistent with the past memories; however, Response 1 is slightly less consistent because it does not directly mention or align with the specific past memory that Speaker Aâ€™s knee issues are due to hiking along the coast and collecting shells, as stated in the past memories. Response 2, on the other hand, aligns better since it attributes the knee issues to consistent hiking, which is stated in the past memory.\n\nChoice: 2"
