One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha!\nSpeaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes?\nSpeaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe. \nSpeaker A: You make them sounds so fascinating. Will you take them with you to your college dorm? \nSpeaker B: I'll be living off campus, so absolutely. How about you? Are you staying in the dorms? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I'll be living off campus too. I'm looking forward to having more space and a quieter environment for studying.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: I agree, snakes are truly fascinating creatures! And that's great that you'll be able to bring them with you. I'll actually be staying off campus as well, so no dorm life for me either. It's nice to have a bit more freedom and space.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nThe past memories do not specify where Speaker A plans to live during college, only that they are planning to go to college and are interested in neuroscience. Both potential responses do not contradict this information as neither contains specific past information about Speaker A's housing plans for college.\n\nChoice: 1"
