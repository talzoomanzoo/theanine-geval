Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\nSpeaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise? \nSpeaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows.\nSpeaker A: That sounds wonderful! You'd get to just be out in nature all day. Sounds like a great job, especially if you're a bit introverted like me. That's why hiking is my favorite -- a good solitary activity. \nSpeaker B: Yes, I agree. What kind of hours would this new job have?\nSpeaker A: It's third shift, which isn't the greatest, but it pays a bit more than the other shifts, and I think I'll like getting off early in the morning. Then I can just go down and get in my hammock and have a nice relaxing moment after work. \nSpeaker B: Would you feel safe being out there all alone, possibly falling asleep? That just sounds a bit risky. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I've thought about that. I plan to set up my hammock in a safe spot and not too far from the house, so I'll be cautious. Plus, I can always set an alarm to make sure I wake up on time.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: I understand your concern about safety. I always make sure to take necessary precautions when hiking alone and falling asleep in a hammock. I choose safe locations and stay alert. Thank you for looking out for me!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nThe key aspect to consider is Speaker A's plan regarding their hammock. In the past memories, Speaker A mentioned leaving a hammock by the river for anyone to use at a hidden spot and purchasing a hammock online with their earnings. There's no mention that the hammock would be set up near their house, as suggested in Response 1. Response 2 aligns more closely with the past memories, as it focuses on choosing safe locations and taking precautions when using the hammock. \n\nChoice: 2"
