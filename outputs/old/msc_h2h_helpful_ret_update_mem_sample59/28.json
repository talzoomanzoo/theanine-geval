A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal.\nSpeaker B: That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab!\nSpeaker A: Oh! I did not know that. Well if you can clone cows that's more ice cream for you! Haha. What's your favorite ice cream flavor?\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker B has a deaf dog named Sparky, a beagle breed. Speaker A is considering getting a dog and already walks Speaker B's dog, Sparky. Speaker B has invented a chili dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try. \nSpeaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n2. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n4. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n5. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n6. Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides more contextual information relevant to the dialogue. It mentions that Speaker B works at a research lab and is planning to major in molecular biology, which connects to the conversation about cloning and lab work. This information can help Speaker B provide more insight into their background and knowledge about the cloning process, which has been a topic of interest in the dialogue. Additionally, MEMORY 2 includes details about their involvement in molecular biology, which directly relates to the topic of cloning discussed in the context.\n\nChoice: 2"
