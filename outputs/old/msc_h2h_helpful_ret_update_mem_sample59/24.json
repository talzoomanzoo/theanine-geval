    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should benefit Speaker B in making a next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker A is a high school student planning to go to college, achieving straight A's. Speaker A wants Speaker B to continue working in the lab and school instead of giving up their night job. Speaker B is also a high school student preparing for college, working at a diner at night. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner.\n2. Speaker B is considering giving up their night job to focus on lab work and school.\n3. Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n5. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n6. Speaker B is also a high school student preparing for college, working at a diner at night.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides more contextually relevant information for Speaker B in making their next response in the dialogue context. It includes multiple facets of Speaker B's situation, including their interest in neuroscience, their field of molecular biology, and their consideration of quitting their night job, which ties directly into the dialogue context regarding balancing lab work, school, and job duties. These details are more relevant and enriching compared to MEMORY 1.\n\nChoice: 2"
