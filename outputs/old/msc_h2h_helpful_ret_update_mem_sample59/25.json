A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience. Speaker A offers to take Sparky for a walk to help out and spend time with the dog. Speaker A is considering getting a dog and already walks Speaker B's dog, Sparky. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n3. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n4. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n5. Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\n6. Speaker B is considering giving up their night job to focus on lab work and school.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nMEMORY 2 provides information specifically relevant to the dialogue context, such as hamburgers and Speaker B's involvement in lab work. This relates to the discussion about cloned cow hamburgers, plant-based burgers, and Speaker B's interest in lab work. Additionally, the mention of Speaker B majoring in molecular biology and considering giving up a night job aligns with the conversation about balancing work and school commitments. MEMORY 1, while mentioning Speaker B's interest in lab work, does not provide specific tie-ins with the hamburger topic.\n\nChoice: 2"
