A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal.\nSpeaker B: That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab!\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker B, a high school student preparing for college, works at a diner at night. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner. Speaker A had cheesy ham and potato soup for dinner. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n2. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner.\n3. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n4. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n5. Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\n6. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a more detailed and comprehensive background for Speaker B, which can be more beneficial in the context of the conversation about cloning, lab work, and food. It mentions that Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology, which directly relates to the current dialogue about lab research and cloning. Therefore, it offers richer information related to the ongoing topics of cloning, lab involvement, and interest in biological sciences.\n\nChoice: 2"
