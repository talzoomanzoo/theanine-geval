    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories mention Speaker A and Speaker B's plans to travel to Sweden together and Speaker A's consideration of visiting their cousin. However, Memory 1 provides additional context about prior discussions regarding differences between Sweden and the US, coffee breaks, volcanoes in Sweden, and Speaker A's plan to earn money by getting a second part-time job. This extra information about saving money and planning around work schedules would be beneficial for Speaker A when discussing the trip's progress. Memory 2, while detailed, focuses more on Speaker B's sentimental connection to Sweden, which is less directly relevant to planning the trip.\n\nChoice: 1"
