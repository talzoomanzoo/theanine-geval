A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break. This excitement led Speaker B to dye their hair with henna and enjoy experimenting with different hair colors. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one. Both Speaker A and Speaker B have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation. Speaker A has a granddaughter who is a cosmetologist and helped dye their hair in streaks. Speaker A is getting their hair dyed turquoise by their youngest grandchild, who wants to pursue hairdressing as a profession. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet, showing their excitement for the upcoming adventure.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n2. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n3. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\n4.

Both Speaker A's mother and Speaker A were librarians, but Speaker A is retired.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 contains relevant information that can be tied back to the dialogue context, specifically addressing Speaker B's excitement for the trip and planning for an adventurous spring break. Additionally, it provides context about Speaker B's plans, including the new car they will be using and their focus on driving during the break. This could lead to conversations about Speaker B's travel plans and preparations. MEMORY 1, while it does mention Speaker B's eagerness for the upcoming trip, it includes more irrelevant information about hair dyeing and humor, which are less likely to direct the next response related to travel or spring break discussions.\n\nChoice: 2"
