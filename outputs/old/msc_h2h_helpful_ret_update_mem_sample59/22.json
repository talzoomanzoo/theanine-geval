A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker B, a high school student preparing for college, works at a diner at night but is considering giving up their job to focus on lab work and school. Additionally, Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, displaying an interest in neuroscience. Speaker A offers to take Sparky for a walk to help out and spend time with the dog, as Speaker B's dog is deaf and needs to be kept on a lead due to recall difficulties.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\n2. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n3. Speaker B is considering giving up their night job to focus on lab work and school.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the challenges and rewards of having a dog with hearing issues.\n6.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 contains more detailed and relevant information that aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It provides insights into Speaker B's academic ambitions and specific interests in molecular biology and neuroscience, which are directly related to the lab work being discussed. Additionally, it references Speaker B's job considerations in relation to lab work. This richer context can support a more informed response from Speaker B regarding their plans to continue working in the lab.\n\nChoice: 2"
