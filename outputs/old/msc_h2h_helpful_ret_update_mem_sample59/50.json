A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker B, as a therapist, discusses the challenges and rewards of the profession. They also express concerns about the costs associated with owning horses and explore the psychological aspects of horse ownership in relation to Freudian theories. \nSpeaker B's mother being a nurse led to their career as a therapist. They express a desire to have a horse in the future and contemplate the psychological aspects of horse ownership through Freudian theories. \nSpeaker A is experienced in horse breeding and care, working at a stable and enjoying being around horses. They transition from their expertise in horses to their lack of knowledge in psychology.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n2. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n3. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n4. Speaker B lives in the city and is interested in having a horse in the future.\n5. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n6. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B could pay a fee to a ranch to take care of a horse.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides more context that directly relates to Speaker B's profession as a therapist, including aspects of their career journey and personal interests, thus aligning more closely with the ongoing conversation about therapy. It connects with the topic of horse ownership, which could be relevant to the conversation about therapy. On the other hand, MEMORY 2, while providing a broader range of topics, offers less depth on any singular aspect that could directly enhance the current dialogue about therapy. Therefore, MEMORY 1 offers richer information related to the current conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
