A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal.\nSpeaker B: That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab!\nSpeaker A: Oh! I did not know that. Well if you can clone cows that's more ice cream for you! Haha. What's your favorite ice cream flavor?\nSpeaker B: Yes, more ice cream is always good, haha! I like a good rocky road, or pretty much any chocolate ice cream with nuts or stir-ins! I like most of Jeni's brand too. How about you? What is your favorite kind?\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker A has hobbies of running and listening to music, and is interested in getting a dog. Speaker A had a hamster named Leonardo in the past and currently walks Speaker B's dog, Sparky. Speaker A is considering getting a dog and wants to try the chilli dog casserole invented by Speaker B. \nSpeaker B, a high school student preparing for college, works at a diner at night. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner, and had cheesy ham and potato soup for dinner. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce, and has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n2. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner.\n3. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n5. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n6. Speaker A had cheesy ham and potato soup for dinner.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 contains more relevant information about the current dialogue context. It highlights the overlap of interests in food, with details about Speaker B's culinary pursuits outside of the lab that relate to the previous discussion on plant-based and cloned foods. Specifically, it provides information about Speaker B's cooking inventions, Speaker A's interest in trying these foods, and Speaker B's dual involvement in cooking and lab research, which connects to the cloning discussion. \n\nMEMORY 1, on the other hand, includes extraneous information about Speaker A’s hobbies and pets, which are not directly pertinent to the ongoing conversation about food and cloning.\n\nChoice: 2"
