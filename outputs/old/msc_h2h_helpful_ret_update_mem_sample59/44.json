A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker A is involved in horse breeding and taking care of horses, which has caused Speaker B to work in their own therapy practice for about six years. \nSpeaker B, a therapist and football fan supporting the Chiefs, mentions the ups and downs of the profession, and wants to live in the city and have a horse in the future.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n2. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n3. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n4. Speaker B is a professional in a practice, where it is illegal for them to have relationships with clients.\n5. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n6. Speaker A is married and has been for four years.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more informative as it provides various insights into Speaker B's background and thoughts, specifically those that deal with Speaker B's professional life and considerations related to psychology. This includes how Speaker B potentially relates personal interests, like horses, to their work in therapy, incorporating aspects like Freudian theories. Such details can help Speaker B articulate their journey into becoming a therapist by connecting personal interests to their professional knowledge and decision-making. MEMORY 1, although helpful, doesn't offer as many links between Speaker B's interests and their decision to become a therapist as MEMORY 2 does.\n\nChoice: 2"
