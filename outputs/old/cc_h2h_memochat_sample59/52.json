    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 1 is consistent because it maintains a coherent and logical interaction between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, who are already having the conversation. Co-worker B acknowledges the offer and politely declines, aligning with the earlier part of the conversation where Co-worker B indicates they can manage. Response 2 introduces an \"Unknown\" speaker, which is inconsistent given that the conversation is ongoing between Co-worker A and Co-worker B. Introducing a new speaker disrupts the continuity and consistency of the participants in the dialogue without any prior context to support such an introduction.\n\nChoice: 1"
