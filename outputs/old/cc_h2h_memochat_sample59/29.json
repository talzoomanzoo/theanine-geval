    "memory_text": "Neighbors A and B initially wanted to spend more time together as they didn't know each other well. Now, they are on friendly terms and enjoy spending time together. Additionally, both neighbors enjoy spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn. As a result, Neighbor B agrees that mowing the lawn is a lot of work but acknowledges the exercise it provides. Furthermore, they plan to hang out once a week, possibly watching a movie, getting coffee, or just talking. This indicates that Neighbors A and B have not seen each other in a while and are catching up. Moreover, Neighbor A mentioned mowing the lawn with an old push mower, suggesting they are responsible for the yard work. This is related to Neighbor A feeling pressured to look perfect all the time by their mom, who scolds them for ripping off the tag from their new shirt.",
