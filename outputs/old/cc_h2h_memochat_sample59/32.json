    "memory_text": "Neighbors A and B, who have known each other for years, enjoy spending time together and want to get to know each other even better. They reminisce about past events and plan to hang out once a week, possibly watching a movie, getting coffee, or just talking. Both neighbors enjoy spending time outside and doing chores like mowing the lawn. Additionally, Neighbor A particularly enjoys spending time in Neighbor B's cozy home and wants to hang out more often.",

    "prediction": "I'm sorry, it seems there was an error in your response. Here is the correct response:\n\nExplanation: \nResponse 1 is consistent with the current conversation. Neighbors B acknowledges Neighbors A's expression of enjoyment in spending time together and reciprocates the sentiment, aligning well with Neighbors A's statement about wanting to get to know them better. Response 2 introduces a third-party \"Unknown\" speaker who is not part of the conversation, which is inconsistent as there is no indication of an additional person present in the dialogue. \n\nChoice: 1"
