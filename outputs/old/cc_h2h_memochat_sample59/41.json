You can't just take someone away like that. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers A: I was just joking, Co-worker B. I would never actually do something like that.\nRESPONSE 2\nUnknown: I understand your concern, Co-worker B. It's important to respect the autonomy and choices of others, including the bride.

    "prediction": "Explanation: There are no past memories provided for context, but based on the current conversation, Response 1 is more consistent. It addresses Co-worker B directly and provides a plausible explanation that Co-worker A was joking, aligning with the initial tone of the conversation. Response 2 introduces an individual who wasn't part of the conversation (Unknown), which creates inconsistency due to the lack of introduction or previous mention of this speaker.\n\nChoice: 1"
