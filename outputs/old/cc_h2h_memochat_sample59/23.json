    "memory_text": "1. Neighbors A and B are excited to start this weekend and are looking forward to it. They haven't seen each other in a while and are catching up. Neighbor B is being comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A.\n\n2. Neighbors A and B, who are not well acquainted, express their desire to spend more time together. As they catch up after a long time, they discuss the temperature inside the house compared to the hotter weather outside. This leads to Neighbor A's mom scolding them for removing the tag from a new shirt.\n\n3. They make plans to hang out weekly, considering activities like watching a movie, getting coffee, or simply talking. Neighbor B, who enjoys cooking, suggests cooking together. Furthermore, Neighbor B's thoughtful suggestion of having extra water available for when Neighbor A mows the lawn shows mutual consideration.",

Response 2 introduces an \"Unknown\" speaker, which contradicts the setting as there has been no indication or memory of an additional person being involved in the conversation between Neighbors A and Neighbors B.\n\nChoice: 1"
