I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends.\nMentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\nMentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nMentor: It's completely normal to feel that way, Mentee. Building new friendships takes time, but I believe you'll find your place soon. Just keep being yourself and open to new experiences.\nRESPONSE 2\nUnknown: It's completely understandable to feel that way, Mentee. Starting over in a new city can be challenging, but remember that many others have felt the same at some point. It's an opportunity to step out of your comfort zone and make new connections. Perhaps try joining clubs or social events to meet like-minded individuals. Building new friendships takes time, so be patient and kind to yourself during this transition period.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",

The Mentee hopes to inspire others to join the cause of gender equality and fighting discrimination, so the Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process, even though the Mentee is feeling overwhelmed with the college application process.",

    "raw_prediction": "It's completely normal to feel that way, Mentee. Building new friendships takes time, but I believe you'll find your place soon. Just keep being yourself and open to new experiences.",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are consistent with the conversation, as they address the Mentee's feelings of loneliness and the challenges of starting in a new city. Both responses offer encouragement and advice on making new connections. However, the criterion is to evaluate based on past memories, and in this case, there are no specific past memories provided to contradict either response. Response 1 is more personal and simpler, while Response 2 offers more detailed suggestions on how to make friends. Neither of them contradicts any information from the conversation. However, the distinction as the speaker (\"Mentor\" in response 1 and \"Unknown\" in response 2) could suggest a lack of context for response 2 being part of this specific conversation between Mentor and Mentee. Therefore, Response 1 is slightly better in terms of consistency given this context.\n\nChoice: 1"
