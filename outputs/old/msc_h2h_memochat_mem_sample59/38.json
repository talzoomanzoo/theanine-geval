    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden?\nSpeaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: That sounds like a great plan for next summer! I'll make sure to check out the beach spots you mentioned when I visit Sweden.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: That sounds like a fun plan for next summer! Have you been to any beach spots in Sweden before?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses refer to Speaker B's mention of beach spots and future plans to visit Sweden, but Response 1 is more closely tied to Speaker B's past memories mentioned in the conversation. Speaker A actively recalls and acknowledges Speaker B's enjoyment of beach spots in Sweden, indicating that they will also take an interest in these spots when visiting. Response 2, on the other hand, questions Speaker B if they have been to beach spots before, which is redundant because Speaker B already mentioned enjoying beach spots in the past. Therefore, Response 1 better reflects the past memories shared in the conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
