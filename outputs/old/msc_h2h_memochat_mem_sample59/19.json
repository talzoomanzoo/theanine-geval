    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\nSpeaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car?\nSpeaker B: Yes, there are several. Hope we could meet and You possibly teach me about computer programming.\nSpeaker A: That would be great too. I like to program in several different languages. Do you have a preference? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I don't have a preference yet, but I'm eager to learn more about them.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: That's awesome! I can teach you programming in different languages. Do you have a preference for a specific programming language that you would like to start with?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response recalls any past memories mentioned previously in the conversation. Both responses keep the topic of programming languages in mind, but only Response 1 adheres closely to the previous flow, which is that Speaker A was offering to teach programming. Response 2 disrupts this established context by suggesting that Speaker B can teach instead, which goes against the current conversation's narrative. Hence, Response 1 is more aligned with the past conversation and maintains the continuity of offering learning.\n\nChoice: 1"
