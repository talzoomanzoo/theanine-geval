    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: That would be awesome! I'll make sure there's some time for swimming and programming on the cruise too.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: That sounds like a great idea! We could incorporate some swimming lessons and programming study sessions into our cruise plans. It will be a fun and productive trip!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses refer back to the themes of the upcoming meetup and the mentioned activities of swimming and programming. However, neither response references any additional past memories. In terms of reflecting on the current conversation, both responses incorporate the idea of including swimming and programming in a future cruise plan, but they do not differ in how they connect these to past memories because no specific past memory is shared. Thus, both are similar in terms of memorability.\n\nChoice: tie"
