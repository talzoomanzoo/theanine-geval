    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I totally get what you mean. It's always good to be informed about what we're eating. Would you be up for trying a plant-based burger together sometime?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: It's great to have an open mind about trying plant-based options! Understanding more about the cloning process can definitely influence our food choices. What are your thoughts on the ethical considerations of cloning animals for food production?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response directly references any past memories because the conversation seems to happen without specific recalled instances from memory. Therefore, the focus is on how well each response reflects or acknowledges the topics discussed earlier in the conversation, such as cloning or plant-based burgers. Response 1 follows up on the plant-based burger conversation and offers a social activity related to it, maintaining continuity. Response 2 takes a different approach and introduces a new topic about ethical considerations, which isn't directly covered in the past conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
