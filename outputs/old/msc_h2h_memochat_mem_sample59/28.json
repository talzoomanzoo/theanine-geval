    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal.\nSpeaker B: That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab!\nSpeaker A: Oh! I did not know that. Well if you can clone cows that's more ice cream for you! Haha. What's your favorite ice cream flavor? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I love mint chocolate chip ice cream! It's so refreshing and has just the right amount of sweetness. What about you, what's your favorite flavor?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: That's a fun perspective! My favorite ice cream flavor is mint chocolate chip. What's yours?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nBoth responses recall the mention of ice cream in the conversation and respond to Speaker A's question about favorite ice cream flavor with \"mint chocolate chip.\" However, Response 1 adds personal details about why Speaker B likes mint chocolate chip ice cream, making it slightly more memorable as it gives more depth to the recollection of past events related to the conversation. Response 2 is more straightforward and repeats information already acknowledged, without further elaboration.\n\nChoice: 1"
