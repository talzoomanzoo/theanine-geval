    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you  \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Thank you, I appreciate your willingness to teach me how to swim. I'm excited for our meetup this weekend!\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: That's great to hear! I can help you learn how to swim before our meetup this weekend. Just let me know if you're interested in giving it a try.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response directly recalls specific past memories, as no past memories have been provided. However, Response 1 is more consistent with the current conversation because it acknowledges Speaker A's offer to teach Speaker B how to swim and expresses excitement for the upcoming meetup. Response 2 incorrectly implies that Speaker B is offering to teach Speaker A how to swim, which contradicts the conversation's flow and context. Therefore, Response 1 indirectly reflects more attentive listening to the immediate context.\n\nChoice: 1"
