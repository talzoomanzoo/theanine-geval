    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Therapy can definitely be helpful in processing past experiences. It's great that you find solace in riding your horses though, there's something special about that bond.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: It's great that you have found therapy in riding your horses, but talking to someone could also be beneficial for addressing any unresolved childhood trauma. Therapy can provide a safe space for exploring and processing these experiences.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither of the responses directly recalls specific past memories beyond the current conversation. Both responses acknowledge the Speaker A's mention of finding solace in riding horses and the idea of having unresolved childhood trauma. However, Response 1 simply shows understanding of Speaker A's current sources of solace without delving into therapy, while Response 2 builds on the current conversation with context about the potential therapeutic benefits regarding childhood trauma. While Memorability typically looks to past memories beyond the conversation at hand, here both are tied because neither one refers to any past memories, only seen in the current conversation.\n\nChoice: tie"
