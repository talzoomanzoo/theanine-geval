    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response includes information from past memories, as there are no past memories provided. However, both responses acknowledge Speaker B's trip to Costa Rica and express excitement. Response 2 adds an extra detail about Costa Rica being a beautiful destination with amazing wildlife and nature, which doesn't necessarily reflect on past memories since no such details were mentioned. Both options lack the use of any past conversations or experiences with traveling to Costa Rica.\n\nChoice: tie"
