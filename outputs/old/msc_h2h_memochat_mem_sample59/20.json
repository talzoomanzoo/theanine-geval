    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\nSpeaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car?\nSpeaker B: Yes, there are several. Hope we could meet and You possibly teach me about computer programming.\nSpeaker A: That would be great too. I like to program in several different languages. Do you have a preference?\nSpeaker B: No, I'm just getting started so I don't have a preference. Maybe you could show me what you prefer and we could start there. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: Perfect, we can start with Python, it's a great language to begin with. I'll show you the basics.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: Pizzaburgers, punk music, programming, and swim time! Let's incorporate all of those into our learning sessions together. I can show you some programming languages and we can start from there.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither of the responses explicitly reflect any specific past memories since no past memories have been given. However, Response 2 more closely calls back to elements from the conversation, such as \"punk music,\" \"programming,\" and \"swim time,\" indicating an effort to tie these elements together for memorable and contextual learning sessions. \n\nChoice: 2"
