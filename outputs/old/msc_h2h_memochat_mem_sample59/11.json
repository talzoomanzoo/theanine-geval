Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun! \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: That sounds awesome! I can't wait to listen to it while we hang out by the pool and then get into our programming studies.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: That sounds like a great plan! I'm looking forward to our meetup this weekend for punk rock and pizza burgers.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nWithout any past memories provided, we assess the options based solely on the current conversation content. Response 1 directly reflects and acknowledges the mention of \"fun music for the pool\" and \"steady music for our programming studies,\" making it more contextually relevant to the specific details of the playlist described by Speaker A. Response 2 introduces new information (\"punk rock and pizza burgers\") that isn't mentioned in the current conversation, which may imply an independent memory or plan not reflected in the present exchange.\n\nChoice: 1"
