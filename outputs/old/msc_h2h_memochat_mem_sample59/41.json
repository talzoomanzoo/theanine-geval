    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden?\nSpeaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends.\nSpeaker A: That sounds nice! So how is your job going?\nSpeaker B: Always interesting, that's for sure! I have been training to nurse on a new floor, so that'll give me a change of scenery.\nSpeaker A: Does that add a lot of extra work to your plate? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: It definitely keeps me on my toes, but I'm excited for the new challenge.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: It seems like Speaker B has been training to nurse on a new floor, which might add some extra work to their plate. You could follow up by asking how they are adjusting to the new responsibilities or if they are enjoying the change of scenery.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response directly recalls specific past memories from the conversation or indicates an intention to refer back to any previous statements made by either speaker. Both responses primarily deal with the current conversation topic without bringing in additional past details. However, Response 1 directly addresses the question about the workload, which makes it more connected to the conversation, albeit without reference to earlier memories. Response 2 seems to suggest a meta-level analysis of Speaker B's spoken context rather than actually responding as Speaker B would in the conversation, making it less fitting to the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 1"
