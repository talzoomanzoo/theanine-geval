    "prediction": "Explanation: \nNeither response leverages past memories to enhance memorability, as no specific past experiences or shared memories are referenced. However, Response 2 provides a more detailed description of the nature walk, which can create a more vivid mental image and a stronger conversation. Despite no specific recollection of past memories, the detailed nature of Response 2 makes it slightly more memorable than the more generic Response 1.\n\nChoice: 2"
