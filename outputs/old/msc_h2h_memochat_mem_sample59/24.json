    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I agree, it's hard to know for sure where our food comes from. I'll keep working hard in the lab and school.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: It's great to encourage Speaker B to not quit if classes get tough. Your point about the source of beef is interesting and raises questions about food transparency in the future.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The conversation focuses on working in a lab where they are cloning a cow and the potential challenges Speaker B might face if classes become too difficult. The responses should adequately reflect on these points with memories related to Speaker B's interest in the lab work and food cloning. Response 1 mentions the Speaker B’s intention to continue working hard both in the lab and in school, which aligns with the topic's context. Though response 2 acknowledges Speaker A's encouragement, it fails to specifically recall any commitment or detail related to Speaker B’s choices about the lab work or the connection to classes.\n\nChoice: 1"
