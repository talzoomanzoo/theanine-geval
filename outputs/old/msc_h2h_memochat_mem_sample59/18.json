    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\nSpeaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car?\nSpeaker B: Yes, there are several. Hope we could meet and You possibly teach me about computer programming. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: That sounds like a plan! I can definitely help you with computer programming as well during our meetup this weekend.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: That sounds like a great idea! I would be happy to teach you about computer programming, especially if we can incorporate punk music and pizzaburgers into our study sessions like we discussed before. Looking forward to it!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Given that there is no mention of \"pizzaburgers\" or incorporating \"punk music\" into programming study sessions in the current conversation, Response 2 references elements not mentioned or needed in the context, suggesting such elements were possibly discussed prior and not recorded in the provided memories or current conversation. Response 1, however, directly acknowledges the current conversation's mention of computer programming and the meetup this weekend without introducing unsupported elements, which more directly ties to Speaker B's hopes of learning computer programming during their meetup. Thus, Response 1 better reflects memorability of the immediate dialogue and plans discussed.\n\nChoice: 1"
