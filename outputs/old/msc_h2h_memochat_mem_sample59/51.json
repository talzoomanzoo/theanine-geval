    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\nSpeaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient!  \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: That's interesting to know, I didn't realize therapy could be completed in a shorter time frame for some. I'll definitely consider reaching out to you for a session.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: It's true that the duration of therapy can vary greatly depending on the individual and their needs. Some people may only need a few sessions to achieve their goals, while others may benefit from long-term therapy. It's important to listen to your own needs and work with a therapist who can support you in reaching your desired outcomes.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nBoth responses acknowledge the variability in therapy duration that was discussed in the previous exchange. However, Response 1 directly reflects on the newfound knowledge about therapy completion shared by Speaker B and implies a personal consideration of the information. Response 1 also indicates a potential action (\"I'll definitely consider reaching out to you for a session\"), which is a direct result of the conversation, making it more memorable and connected to the specific details provided by Speaker B. Response 2 reiterates the concept but in a more general and impersonal manner, which doesn't directly relate to Speaker A's personal realization or potential actions discussed in Response 1.\n\nChoice: 1"
