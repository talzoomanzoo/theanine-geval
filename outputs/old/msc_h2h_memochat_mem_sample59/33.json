Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: That's exciting! How's the planning going so far?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: That's great to hear about your progress in planning your trip to Sweden! Have you decided on any specific activities or places you want to visit while you're there?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses show interest in Speaker A's trip planning, but Response 2 explicitly recalls the detail about the trip being to Sweden, whereas Response 1 only asks about the planning in general without mentioning any specifics about the trip. This makes Response 2 a better choice for memorability as it more directly reflects the past memory of Speaker A mentioning Sweden.\n\nChoice: 2"
