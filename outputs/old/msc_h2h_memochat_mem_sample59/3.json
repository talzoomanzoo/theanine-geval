    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I'm doing well, thank you for asking. I recently finished reading \"Where the Crawdads Sing\" by Delia Owens, and I highly recommend it. How about you, any new books on your reading list?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: That sounds like an amazing trip to Costa Rica! I'm doing well, thank you for asking. As for books, I recently read a great one about family growth. It made me reflect on how fast my youngest grandchild is growing up at 14 years old.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nIn this context, neither response references any specific past memory since there are none provided. Both responses engage with the recent conversation sentence by Speaker B, acknowledging the question about books. However, Response 2 adds a personal touch by mentioning family growth and a specific detail about a grandchild being 14 years old. The reflection on the grandchild adds a memory or personal anecdote, introducing a new memory into the conversation that could build memorability. In comparison, Response 1 simply talks about a recently read book without adding any distinctive memory component.\n\nChoice: 2"
