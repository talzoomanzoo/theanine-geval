    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden?\nSpeaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends.\nSpeaker A: That sounds nice! So how is your job going?\nSpeaker B: Always interesting, that's for sure! I have been training to nurse on a new floor, so that'll give me a change of scenery.\nSpeaker A: Does that add a lot of extra work to your plate?\nSpeaker B: At the moment, yes. I'll be in Pediatrics, which has always been my passion. It's a completely different environment than the ER.\nSpeaker A: Oh wow! That is so exciting for you. Will you get to stay in pediatrics after the training is complete? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I hope so! It's a new challenge, but I am looking forward to the opportunity.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: That's great to hear about your training in Pediatrics! It sounds like a fulfilling opportunity. Will you have the chance to continue working in that department once your training is finished?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nBoth responses aim to reflect on Speaker B's current work situation and training in Pediatrics. However, Response 2 not only acknowledges Speaker A's comment about Speaker B's training but also rephrases Speaker A's last question about staying in Pediatrics after training, thereby better recalling the immediate context of their conversation about Speaker B's new job role. Response 1 acknowledges the excitement and opportunity but lacks the specificity of Memorability by not directly addressing the inquiry about continuing in Pediatrics after training.\n\nChoice: 2"
