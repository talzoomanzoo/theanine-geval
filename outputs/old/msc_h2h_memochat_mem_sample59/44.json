Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I've always been interested in helping others and psychology, so becoming a therapist felt like a natural fit for me.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: I had to train for a while with other people before I was fully certified and licensed, but I've now been working in my own practice for about six years. It's going alright.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses touch on different aspects of Speaker B's journey to becoming a therapist, but neither directly reflects specific past memories. However, Response 2 provides more detail about Speaker B's past experiences in their career journey, such as training with others and establishing their own practice, which implies memories of those specific events and experiences. This gives it a slight edge in terms of memorability as it anchors Speaker B's decision to become a therapist in their lived experiences.\n\nChoice: 2"
