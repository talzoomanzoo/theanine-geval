    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\nSpeaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing? \nSpeaker B: He's doing well! He just finished theatre camp and he's fighting with my sister because he wants to dye his hair green hahaha. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: Sounds like he's taking after your adventurous side with that hair color choice! Have you ever considered trying a bold color like that?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: It's great to hear that he's doing well after finishing theatre camp! It sounds like he's full of personality and individuality, especially wanting to dye his hair green. Speaking of family growth, my youngest grandchild is also growing up fast at 14 years old.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses connect to the conversation about Speaker B's nephew wanting to dye his hair green, but Response 2 also introduces a point about Speaker A's family by mentioning their grandchild. However, this connection is not based on any previously stated memories in the conversation, so it does not enhance the memorability connected to past dialogues. On the other hand, Response 1 draws a direct implication that the adventurous nature of wanting to dye hair green is similar to Speaker B's own potential adventurous spirit, making a more immediate and relevant link to the recent conversation flow.\n\nChoice: 1"
