Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal.\nSpeaker B: That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab!\nSpeaker A: Oh! I did not know that. Well if you can clone cows that's more ice cream for you! Haha. What's your favorite ice cream flavor?\nSpeaker B: Yes, more ice cream is always good, haha! I like a good rocky road, or pretty much any chocolate ice cream with nuts or stir-ins! I like most of Jeni's brand too. How about you? What is your favorite kind?\nSpeaker A: I am a big fan of cookie dough ice cream, and I love cheesecake flavored ice creams too! Ben & Jerry has some that I like, but I prefer to get ice cream from an ice cream shop.  It's just something about being in that environment, \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: That's true, the atmosphere in an ice cream shop is always special. I think it enhances the whole experience. Do you have a favorite ice cream shop that you like to go to?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: It seems like you really enjoy different flavors of ice cream! Have you tried any unique or exotic flavors at ice cream shops before?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The conversation between Speaker A and Speaker B focuses on the experiences and preferences related to ice cream, with Speaker A expressing an appreciation for ice cream shops. Speaker B could build upon this past memory by further discussing favorite ice cream shops, as the setting enhances Speaker A's experience with ice cream. Response 1 directly addresses this by asking if Speaker A has a favorite ice cream shop, thus making it more memorable based on the recalled detail about enjoying the ice cream shop environment. Response 2, while related to ice cream, shifts the focus away from the specific memory of the ice cream shop experience and more toward flavors, which is less aligned with the detailed recollection by Speaker A about enjoying the atmosphere of ice cream shops.\n\nChoice: 1"
