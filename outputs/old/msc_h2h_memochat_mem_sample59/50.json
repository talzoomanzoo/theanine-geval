    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Therapy can definitely have a beginning, middle, and end, and it's great to hear about your positive experiences with your horses. Let me know if you ever decide to give therapy a try, I'd be more than happy to help.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: Yes, therapy can have an endpoint when the client successfully completes their journey. It's not something that has to last forever.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses acknowledge the idea introduced by Speaker A that therapy can have a completion point. Response 1 reflects on the mention of horses, showing an understanding and recall of Speaker A's past statement about finding therapy in riding horses, which shows better Memorability of the current conversation's details. Although Response 2 ties back to the point about therapy having an endpoint, it misses the opportunity to reflect back on Speaker A's mention of horse riding as their form of therapy.\n\nChoice: 1"
