    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\nSpeaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient! \nSpeaker A: Wow, that gives me a completely different perspective. You'd really be ok with seeing me? You don't think it would be a conflict of interest since we're friends? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I appreciate your concern, but as a professional, I always maintain strict boundaries with my clients. I believe I could provide you with the support you need without any conflicts.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: Given the recent dialogue, it seems like Speaker B has experience in therapy practice and has offered to see Speaker A as a client. Speaker B's willingness to see Speaker A suggests a level of professionalism and care in their practice. It's important to discuss any potential conflicts of interest openly and establish boundaries to ensure a professional therapeutic relationship.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response directly draws on past memories provided, but both responses reflect on the last part of the conversation about boundaries and conflicts of interest. Response 1 more directly addresses Speaker A's concern about conflict of interest by Speaker B explicitly reassuring them of their professionalism. Response 2 is more of a general commentary on maintaining professionalism. Since the criterion is Memorability, neither response strongly utilizes past memories, but Response 1 is more memorable as it directly addresses the immediate concern of conflict of interest.\nChoice: 1"
