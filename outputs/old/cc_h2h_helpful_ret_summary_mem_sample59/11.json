    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a varied set of information points about the Mentee's current life situation, such as feeling overwhelmed with the college application process, adapting to a new job in a city, and being reassured by their Mentor. These points are crucial for addressing the Mentee's current feelings of loneliness in the new city, as they potentially relate to the decision to move, past experiences, and currently feeling overwhelmed. MEMORY 1 mostly duplicates this information and adds irrelevant points, such as the incident with taking shoes without context or resolution. Therefore, MEMORY 2 provides richer and more targeted information to help in the next response.\n\nChoice: 2"
