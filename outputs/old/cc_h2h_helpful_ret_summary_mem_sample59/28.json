A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit.\nNeighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water.\nNeighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it.\nNeighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again.\nNeighbors A: I won't. So, do you remember the time when I mowed the lawn with that old push mower?\nNeighbors B: Yeah, I remember that. That was pretty tough work.\nNeighbors A: It was. But it was also a good workout.\n\nMEMORY 1\nNeighbors A and B plan to hang out once a week, possibly watching a movie, getting coffee, or just talking. They have not seen each other in a while and are catching up. Neighbors A mentioned mowing the lawn with an old push mower, indicating they are responsible for the yard work. This leads to a conversation about both enjoying spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Co-worker A and Co-worker B excel at working well with others and resolving issues.\n2. Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace.\n3. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B value communication and understanding in relationships.\n4. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B enjoy taking moments to connect with each other and find these moments make work more enjoyable.\n5. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's competence and effort in their work.\n6. Co-worker A strives to do their best in their work.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 is more relevant and helpful because it directly relates to the interaction between Neighbors A and B, specifically mentioning the shared memory of mowing the lawn with an old push mower, which is a topic currently being discussed in the dialogue context. It indicates the previous dynamic between the neighbors and shows that they have shared activities and a history of spending time together. This can help in steering the conversation towards mending their relationship after the earlier misunderstanding. On the contrary, MEMORY 2 discusses the dynamics between two co-workers, which is unrelated to the neighbors' situation in this context.\n\nChoice: 1"
