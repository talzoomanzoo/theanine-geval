Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it.\n\nMEMORY 1\nCo-worker B showed a willingness to assist others by helping a customer resolve an issue last week.
