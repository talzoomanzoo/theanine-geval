    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should benefit Unknown in making a next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit.\nNeighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water.\nNeighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it.\nNeighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again.\nNeighbors A: I won't. So, do you remember the time when I mowed the lawn with that old push mower?\nNeighbors B: Yeah, I remember that. That was pretty tough work.\nNeighbors A: It was. But it was also a good workout.\nNeighbors B: I prefer to work out indoors where there's air conditioning.\n\nMEMORY 1\nNeighbors A and B initially wanted to spend more time together as they didn't know each other well. Now, they are on friendly terms and enjoy spending time together. Additionally, both neighbors enjoy spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn. As a result, Neighbor B agrees that mowing the lawn is a lot of work but acknowledges the exercise it provides. Furthermore, they plan to hang out once a week, possibly watching a movie, getting coffee, or just talking. This indicates that Neighbors A and B have not seen each other in a while and are catching up. Moreover, Neighbor A mentioned mowing the lawn with an old push mower, suggesting they are responsible for the yard work. This is related to Neighbor A feeling pressured to look perfect all the time by their mom, who scolds them for ripping off the tag from their new shirt.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace.\n2. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B enjoy taking moments to connect with each other and find these moments make work more enjoyable.\n3. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's competence and effort in their work.\n4. Co-worker A and Co-worker B excel at working well with others and resolving issues.\n5. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B value communication and understanding in relationships.\n6. Co-worker A has a history of helping out Co-worker B and values their friendship.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains specific details about the past interactions and current relationship between Neighbors A and B, including their shared activities, future plans, and perceptions of chores like mowing the lawn. This detailed background is directly relevant to the dialogue context, which involves a conversation between Neighbors A and B about a past incident and a shift in tone towards discussing past shared experiences. In contrast, MEMORY 2 provides information about co-workers and their workplace interactions, which is unrelated to the current dialogue context involving neighbors and their non-work related activities.\n\nChoice: 1"
