You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\n\nMEMORY 1\n1.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains information about Co-worker A and Co-worker B's previous interactions, which might be helpful in understanding their relationship dynamics and motivations for the current conversation about the bride. This memory provides context about Co-worker A's character traits like bravery and positivity, and Co-worker B's admiration and support, which are directly relevant to the dialogue concerning a morally questionable plan. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, is about neighbors with no relevant connection to the co-workers or their current conversation, making it less applicable.\n\nChoice: 1"
