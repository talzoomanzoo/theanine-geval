A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it.\nCo-workers B: That's not the same thing, Co-workers A. Stealing someone and keeping them against their will is illegal and immoral. You need to let go of this obsession and move on.\n\nMEMORY 1\n- Co-worker A felt guilty about borrowing a pencil from Co-worker B without asking, similar to how they intervened to separate two women in a fight.\n- Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that intervening in the fight was not a big deal and suggested making it up by buying coffee next time, showing their supportive nature.\n- Co-worker A's bravery and willingness to help were commended by Co-worker B, who admires their resilience and positivity, even in challenging situations like the accident where they lost their hands and feet.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Neighbors A enjoys living in the neighborhood, feeling comfortable and safe, and has made good friends, including Neighbors B.\n2. Neighbor A has been living in the same place for a long time and enjoys the neighborhood and people there.\n3. Neighbors B has been living in the neighborhood for some time and is supportive of Neighbors A.\n4. Neighbors A values the relationship with Neighbors B and considers them like family.\n5. Neighbors B acknowledges Neighbors A's friendly and outgoing nature.\n6. Neighbors A is excited to explore the neighborhood and make new friends.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains information that is highly relevant to the dialogue context. It discusses Co-worker A's tendency to act impulsively without regard for others' consent, which parallels their scheme to \"never let the bride get married.\" Furthermore, it mentions Co-worker B's reaction to these actions, showing their supportive and corrective nature, which is consistent with their role in the current conversation. In contrast, MEMORY 2 is about Neighbor relationships and lacks relevance to the discussion about kidnapping and obsession, offering no useful information for forming a response to the current issues in the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 1"
