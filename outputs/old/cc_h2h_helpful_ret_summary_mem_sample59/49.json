This information is directly related to the context where Co-worker B might be in a position to offer support again due to Co-worker A's current heavy workload. Meanwhile, MEMORY 2 consists of details from a different relationship context (Classmates A and B) that are not directly relevant to the work environment context of the dialog or helpful in guiding Co-worker B’s response in the given situation.\n\nChoice: 1"
