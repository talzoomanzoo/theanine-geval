Co-worker A strives to do their best in their work.\n6. Co-worker A is seen as competent and reliable by Co-worker B.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 is more relevant because it provides information about the relationship between Neighbor A and Neighbor B, which is directly applicable to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It suggests they have a friendly and considerate relationship, often engaging in activities together like cooking and mowing the lawn, which aligns with the playful communication in the context. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, is entirely about co-workers and their professional relationship, which is unrelated to the neighborly interaction described here.\n\nChoice: 1"
