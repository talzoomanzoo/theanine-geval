    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 is more relevant and helpful because it provides specific information about the relationship between Neighbors A and B, their shared experiences, and their past conversations about temperature and outdoor activities. This information aligns closely with the dialogue context, where the neighbors talk about past experiences and their preferences. Memory 2, on the other hand, is about co-workers and unrelated to the current dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 1"
