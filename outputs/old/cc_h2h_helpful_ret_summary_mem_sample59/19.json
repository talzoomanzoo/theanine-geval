A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends.\nMentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\nMentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here.\nMentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people.\nMentee: Those are good suggestions, Mentor. I'll consider joining a club or volunteering.\nMentor: And remember, it's also important to keep in touch with your old friends. You can schedule video calls or even plan a visit back home.\nMentee: That's true, I'll make sure to keep in touch. Thanks for the advice, Mentor.\nMentor: Anytime, Mentee. Is there anything else you want to talk about or any updates you'd like to share?\nMentee: Actually, I did make a new friend at work. We've been hanging out after work sometimes and it's been nice.\n\nMEMORY 1\n1. The Mentor acknowledges the Mentee's work in advocacy for women and girls and praises their dedication to their values, which caused Mentee to agree to go back to the store to make things right and express gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n2. The Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace, reacting to the Mentor's belief that the Mentee's work has been influential and that they will continue to make an impact in the world.\n3. The Mentor has been guiding and supporting the Mentee in their work for years, leading to the Mentee being offered a job and deciding to take the job in the city.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace.\n2. Mentee agreed to go back to the store to make things right and expressed gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n3. The Mentee has been offered a job and has decided to take the job in the city.\n4. The Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process.\n5. The Mentor is supportive and praises the Mentee for their mature decision-making process.\n6. The Mentee weighed the pros and cons of each option before deciding on the job in the city.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories provide some context about the Mentor's ongoing guidance and the Mentee's decision-making process. However, MEMORY 2 provides a more comprehensive depiction of the Mentee's decision to take a job in the city and the Mentor's supportive role in that process. Although neither Memory perfectly aligns with the current Mentee's feeling of loneliness and exploring new social connections, MEMORY 2 helps infer the Mentee's current context of adjusting to a new environment given that they recently accepted a job in the city. The Mentee's prior decision-making process and the Mentor's support can serve as a foundation for addressing the Mentee’s challenge of loneliness. \n\nChoice: 2"
