    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 is more relevant and helpful to the dialogue context, as it contains information about Co-worker A and Co-worker B's interactions, support, and work-related situations. It demonstrates that Co-worker B has offered help in the past and that there is a spirit of cooperation and gratitude between them. This is directly applicable to the current dialogue where Co-worker A is offering help to Co-worker B regarding workload management. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, involves scenarios related to classmates, not co-workers, and contains unrelated information about school projects and personal achievements.\n\nChoice: 1"
