    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should benefit Unknown in making a next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit.\nNeighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water.\nNeighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it.\nNeighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again.\n\nMEMORY 1\nNeighbors A and B started off not knowing each other well but wanting to spend more time together. As time passed, they became good friends and enjoy reminiscing about past events. Neighbors B, who is supportive, suggests making something together and shows consideration by suggesting having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Co-worker A and Co-worker B excel at working well with others and resolving issues.\n2. Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace.\n3. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B value communication and understanding in relationships.\n4. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's competence and effort in their work.\n5. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B enjoy taking moments to connect with each other and find these moments make work more enjoyable.\n6. Co-worker A strives to do their best in their work.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 is more helpful because it provides context about the relationship dynamic between Neighbors A and B, indicating that they have become good friends and are considerate towards each other. This aligns with the current dialogue context where Neighbor A apologizes and Neighbor B accepts it, suggesting a willingness to maintain a positive relationship. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, focuses on workplace relationships which are unrelated to the neighborly interaction in the dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 1"
