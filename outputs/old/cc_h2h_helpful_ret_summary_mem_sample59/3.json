    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 contains more specific information about the Parent's past and how they've made mistakes and found ways to turn their life around. This relates directly to the Child's inquiry about whether the Parent felt listened to during tough times, such as when they were in detention. Memory 1 also mentions the empathetic relationship between the Parent and Child, which ties into the dialogue about the importance of listening. Memory 2 provides a more general overview of the Parent and Child's supportive relationship, but lacks the specific context of the Parent's experiences with detention and change.\n\nChoice: 1"
