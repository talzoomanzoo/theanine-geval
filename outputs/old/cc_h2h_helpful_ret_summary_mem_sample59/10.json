A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life.\nChild: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you.\nParent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you.\nChild: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you?\nParent: Yeah, it was tough. I felt so alone and scared, and I didn't know if anyone would understand what I was going through. But eventually, I found someone who was willing to listen and it made all the difference.\nChild: I'm glad you found someone to talk to. You know, I remember when we watched the sunrise together a few weeks ago. That was really special.\nParent: It was. I love being able to appreciate the beauty of nature. And you know, having my own place to live in the suburbs makes it even easier to do things like that.\nChild: Yeah, your house is really nice. You've always been good at taking care of yourself.\nParent: Well, I've always valued my independence. Even as a kid, I wanted to do things on my own. That's why I decided to live on my own a few years ago.\nChild: I can see why you would want to do that. You're just really good at being self-sufficient.\nParent: Thanks for saying that. But I still think one of the most important things I can do for others is listen. Whether it's to give advice, or just to let someone feel heard.\n\nMEMORY 1\nThe parent values independence and self-sufficiency, which is why they decided to live on their own a few years ago. This decision was influenced by their desire to provide a safe and stable environment for the child. \nThe parent's past experience of being in juvenile detention and going through a tough time when they got arrested led them to appreciate small moments and find hope even in difficult situations. This ultimately shaped their decision to live in a little house in the suburbs that they love.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations.\n2. The parent values independence and self-sufficiency.\n3. The child is supportive and caring towards the parent.\n4. The child is supportive and proud of their parent for making changes.\n5. The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring.\n6. The parent is currently focused on taking care of themselves and enjoying their independence.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nWhile both MEMORIES provide relevant information about the parent's life values and experiences, MEMORY 1 specifically connects the parent's experiences with the current situation and provides more context on how these experiences have influenced their lifestyle choices, including living on their own in the suburbs. Additionally, MEMORY 1 mentions the parent's past juvenile detention experience, tying it directly to the dialogue context about finding someone to listen. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, provides more general statements about values and relationships without tying them directly to specific life experiences or decisions.\n\nChoice: 1"
