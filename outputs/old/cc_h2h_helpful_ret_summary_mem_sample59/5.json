A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life.\nChild: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you.\nParent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you.\nChild: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you?\nParent: Yeah, it was tough. I felt so alone and scared, and I didn't know if anyone would understand what I was going through. But eventually, I found someone who was willing to listen and it made all the difference.\nChild: I'm glad you found someone to talk to. You know, I remember when we watched the sunrise together a few weeks ago. That was really special.\n\nMEMORY 1\n1. [The Parent's experience in juvenile detention led to a newfound appreciation for small moments, such as watching the sunrise after leaving detention.] - (SameTopic) - [The child reminisces about a special morning watching the sunrise with the parent.]\n   \n2. [The child's supportive and caring attitude towards the parent inspired the Parent to find hope and value small moments even in tough situations.] - (Causes) - [The parent reflects on past mistakes and efforts to make positive changes in life.]\n   \n3. [The child's comforting reassurance towards the parent resulted in the Parent getting to see the sunrise after leaving detention.] - (Changed) - [The parent faced challenges during arrest and had to seek help from a lawyer and the justice system.]\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations.\n2. The child recalls a memorable morning watching the sunrise with the parent.\n3. The Parent eventually got to see the sunrise after leaving detention.\n4. The child is supportive and caring towards the parent.\n5. The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring.\n6. Both the parent and child express love and support for each other.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides context on the Parent's experience in juvenile detention and how it led to an appreciation for small moments like watching the sunrise. It connects directly to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT by mentioning a shared memory of watching the sunrise and elaborates on the child's supportive attitude. It also links the child's reassurance to the Parent's eventual positive experiences post-detention. Therefore, it offers richer, specific information related to the current dialogue about listening and overcoming tough times, which can guide the Parent in responding meaningfully. MEMORY 2, while containing relevant information, is more of a general listing and lacks the direct connections and depth provided by MEMORY 1.\n\nChoice: 1"
