    "prediction": "Explanation: \nMemory 1 provides insights into the dynamics between Co-workers A and B, highlighting their interactions, Co-worker A's actions, and Co-worker B's supportive tendencies. This background information is directly relevant to assessing the current situation where Co-worker A has made an unconventional plan regarding the bride, and Co-worker B is reacting. Understanding their previous interactions and Co-worker B's inclination to provide support can guide how Unknown might further develop the conversation or how Co-worker B might handle the situation.\n\nMemory 2 mainly addresses Neighbors A and B's living situation, feelings about their neighborhood, and their relationship with each other. This information lacks a direct connection to the current dialogue about a problematic plan concerning the bride and offers little insight into how the current dialogue context could be resolved or addressed based on past interactions between the parties involved.\n\nChoice: 1"
