    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should benefit Speaker B in making a next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker A is a high school student planning to go to college, achieving straight A's. Speaker A wants Speaker B to continue working in the lab and school instead of giving up their night job. Speaker B is also a high school student preparing for college, working at a diner at night. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n2. Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule.\n3. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n4. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n5. Speaker B loves the beach and Mediterranean food.\n6. Speaker A is an omnivore.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "As of October 2023, data suggests that the most helpful MEMORY should be related to Speaker B's school-related stress and their interest in lab work. MEMORY 1 provides relevant information, indicating both Speaker A and Speaker B are high school students preparing for college and Speaker B is dealing with managing a night job at a diner alongside schoolwork. This directly ties into their concerns about managing classes and work, making MEMORY 1 more relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. MEMORY 2, however, focuses on Speaker A's job at the restaurant and unrelated personal preferences, failing to address Speaker B's immediate concerns about school, work, and lab involvement.\n\nChoice: 1"
