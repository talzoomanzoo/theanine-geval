A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\nSpeaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient! \nSpeaker A: Wow, that gives me a completely different perspective. You'd really be ok with seeing me? You don't think it would be a conflict of interest since we're friends?\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker A enjoys being around horses, involved in horse breeding and taking care of them. Speaker B is concerned about the cost of owning horses, including medical fees and expenses like horse shoes, and also considers the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories. \nSpeaker B's mom being a nurse and busy with work caused Speaker B to become a therapist, mentioning the ups and downs of the profession, and be a professional in a practice where it is illegal for them to have relationships with clients. \nSpeaker B, a therapist and a football fan supporting the Chiefs, talks about the profession's challenges and the legal restrictions on relationships with clients.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\n3. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n4. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n5. Speaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\n6. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains relevant information about Speaker B's profession as a therapist, including the challenges and legal restrictions associated with the role. This is pertinent to the dialogue context where Speaker B is discussing the nature of therapy and the potential for conflict of interest due to their friendship with Speaker A. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, does not provide any relevant details that could assist Speaker B in responding to concerns about a potential conflict of interest as a therapist.\n\nChoice: 1"
