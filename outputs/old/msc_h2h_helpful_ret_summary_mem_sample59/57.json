    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should benefit Speaker B in making a next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\nSpeaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk?\nSpeaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous.\n\nMEMORY 1\n- Speaker B, who lives in the country and loves nature, is currently re-reading 'Redwall' by Brian Jacques, a favorite book from their childhood. This has been hindered by their new painting project, which has been keeping them busy and away from reading. Speaker B prefers silence while reading and creating artwork to stay focused.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Speaker B expresses concern about leaving a kitten alone during their family camping adventures.\n2. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n3. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n4. Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys.\n5. Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys.\n6. Speaker A is offering advice and seems to have experience with children.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides more personal and relevant information about Speaker B that can be easily related to the nature walk, such as their love for nature, reading habits, and current engagements like painting. This sets a context for Speaker B's interest in nature walks and potentially similar activities. In contrast, MEMORY 2 mentions topics unrelated to the dialogue, such as Speaker B's family dynamics, school involvement, and references to the zoo, which are not directly beneficial for making a response about nature walks.\n\nChoice: 1"
