A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal.\nSpeaker B: That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab!\nSpeaker A: Oh! I did not know that. Well if you can clone cows that's more ice cream for you! Haha. What's your favorite ice cream flavor?\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker B has a deaf dog named Sparky, a beagle breed. Speaker A is considering getting a dog and already walks Speaker B's dog, Sparky. Speaker B has invented a chili dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try. \nSpeaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n2. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n3. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n4. Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule.\n5. Speaker B loves the beach and Mediterranean food.\n6. Speaker A's restaurant plays a mix of songs, mainly easy listening, to create a relaxing environment for diners.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is centered around a conversation about cloning, eating cloned burgers, and plant-based alternatives. Speaker B is explaining the cloning process and discussing food choices, especially plant-based and cloned products. MEMORY 1 provides relevant context about Speaker B's interest in food (their involvement in cooking and intention to try Speaker B's famous hamburgers). It offers insight related to the ongoing conversation about hamburgers and food preferences. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 focuses more on Speaker A's work environment and benefits and Speaker B's personal interest in Mediterranean food and the beach, which are less directly related to the cloning and food discussion in the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 1"
