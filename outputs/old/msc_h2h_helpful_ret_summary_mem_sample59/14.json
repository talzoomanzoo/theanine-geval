    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should benefit Speaker A in making a next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker B, who does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies, wants Speaker A to teach them how to swim and programming. Speaker B also enjoys cruising in their car while listening to punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming. On the other hand, Speaker A, who enjoys cruising and has a favorite club in school, causes Speaker A to plan snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination. This leads to Speaker A and Speaker B discussing the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n2. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n3. Speaker A has planned to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n5. Speaker A is planning a snorkeling trip and has signed up for several trips.\n6. Speaker B is afraid of cruises because they can't swim.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "I'm sorry for the confusion. Let me try again.\n\nExplanation: MEMORY 1 provides a rich contextual background including Speaker B's desire to learn programming, their enjoyment of cruising while listening to punk music, and their inclination to listen to music while swimming. However, MEMORY 2 provides specific details on Speaker B's fear of cruises due to not being able to swim, which directly relates to the dialogue context where swimming and cruising are mentioned. This specific detail about Speaker B's fear is crucial and directly benefits Speaker A in responding to Speaker B's interest in cruising by addressing their fear of not being able to swim. Therefore, MEMORY 2 provides a more directly relevant detail (Speaker B's fear) that could lead to a more empathetic and supportive response from Speaker A while planning activities for their cruise or swimming session.\n\nChoice: 2"
