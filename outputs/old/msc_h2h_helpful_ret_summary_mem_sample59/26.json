A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal.\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker A enjoys running and listening to music as hobbies. Speaker A offers to take Sparky for a walk to help out and spend time with the dog. Speaker A is considering getting a dog and already walks Speaker B's dog, Sparky. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try. \nSpeaker B is also a high school student preparing for college, working at a diner at night. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n2. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n3. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n4. Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule.\n5. Speaker B loves the beach and Mediterranean food.\n6. Speaker A's schedule at the restaurant includes working doubles on Saturdays and 8-hour shifts on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context centers around the discussion of working in a lab, cloning, plant-based burgers, and trying new foods. Speaker B expresses an interest in continuing lab work and talks about the challenges of balancing it with school classes. Both speakers engage in discussing food preferences, specifically about cloned and plant-based foods. MEMORY 1 provides relevant context about Speaker B's involvement in cooking, specifically hamburgers, which connects to the ongoing dialogue about cloned cows and plant-based burgers. Meanwhile, MEMORY 2 focuses on Speaker A's work at a restaurant and Speaker B's food preferences but does not provide as much information directly related to the conversation about cloning and food experimentation.\n\nChoice: 1"
