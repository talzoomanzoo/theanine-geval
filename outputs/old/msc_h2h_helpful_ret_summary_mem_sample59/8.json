A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\nSpeaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing? \nSpeaker B: He's doing well! He just finished theatre camp and he's fighting with my sister because he wants to dye his hair green hahaha.\nSpeaker A: Young people today really have different values than our generation had. Acting sounds like it would be personally rewarding. I also like the arts. I play guitar and piano. You mentioned that you have a poll. That sounds refreshing in the hot weather.\n\nMEMORY 1\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation, despite Speaker B turning 29 next week.\n2. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one; hence, Speaker A, a retired librarian, recommends the book \"Beautiful Ruins\" by Jess Walter for a beach visit.\n3. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break, wanting to go on a trip but has not started packing yet.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n2. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation.\n4. Speaker B has an oldest nephew who is about to turn 14.\n5. Speaker A is older and mentions having blue hair already.\n6. Speaker B received a new car from their mom and plans to drive during spring break.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nThe dialogue primarily focuses on Speaker B's travel plans, their nephew, and the interests of both speakers. Memory 2 provides additional relevant information about Speaker B's nephew (\"an oldest nephew who is about to turn 14\"), which aligns with the mention of the nephew finishing theatre camp and having a disagreement about dying his hair green. This information could help Speaker B decide on sharing more details about their nephew when responding to Speaker A. Although both memories reference the topic of spring break, which isn't directly relevant to the current conversation, Memory 2 adds more detail about personal family connections, making it slightly more useful.\n\nChoice: 2"
