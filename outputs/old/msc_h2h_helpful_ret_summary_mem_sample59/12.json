    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should benefit Speaker A in making a next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\nSpeaker A knows how to swim since the age of 5 and offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\nSpeaker B does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies; looking forward to eating a pizza burger in a pool with punk music playing.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n2. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n3. Speaker B is looking forward to eating a pizza burger in a pool with punk music playing.\n4. Speaker A finds swimming relaxing and uses it to destress from their job.\n5. Speaker B does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies.\n6. Speaker A recommends hiking and exploring the local area for those who can't swim.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories provide insights about Speaker B's interest in punk music and their inability to swim, which are relevant to the context of planning the meetup. However, MEMORY 2 provides additional information about Speaker A’s perspective, like finding swimming relaxing and recommending alternative activities like hiking. These details could help Speaker A craft a more informed response, such as offering further swimming encouragement or suggesting other activities that cater to Speaker B's interests and limitations. Therefore, MEMORY 2 is more helpful as it contains richer information.\n\nChoice: 2"
