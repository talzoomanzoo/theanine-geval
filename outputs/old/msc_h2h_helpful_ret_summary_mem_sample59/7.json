Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\nSpeaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing? \nSpeaker B: He's doing well! He just finished theatre camp and he's fighting with my sister because he wants to dye his hair green hahaha.\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation. \nSpeaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one. \nSpeaker B dyed their hair with henna and enjoys experimenting with different hair colors. \nSpeaker A is getting their hair dyed turquoise by their youngest grandchild, who wants to pursue hairdressing as a profession.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation.\n3. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\n4. Speaker B has an oldest nephew who is about to turn 14.\n5. Speaker B asks if the recommended book is fiction or nonfiction.\n6. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 contains more relevant information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically about Speaker B's oldest nephew, which directly connects to the current topic of conversation. This can help Speaker A make a related comment or inquiry about the nephew, thus creating a more helpful response. MEMORY 1, while mentioning hair dye, lacks the specific connection to the nephew which is central to the current dialogue.\n\nChoice: 2"
