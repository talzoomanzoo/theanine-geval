    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should benefit Speaker A in making a next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker B's interest in becoming a therapist stemmed from their mom being a nurse and busy with work. This led Speaker B to discuss the profession's ups and downs, including the concern about the cost of owning horses and considering the psychological aspects of horse ownership in relation to Freudian theories.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\n3. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n4. Speaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\n5. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n6. Speaker A is studying computer science and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains information directly related to the dialogue context, specifically mentioning Speaker B's inspiration for becoming a therapist and their thoughts on the psychological aspects of horse ownership. This is relevant because the dialogue touches on therapy, why Speaker B became a therapist, and Speaker A's mention of finding therapy in riding horses. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, discusses educational and career aspirations unrelated to therapy or the current conversation, thus not adding as much value to Speaker A’s potential response. \n\nChoice: 1"
