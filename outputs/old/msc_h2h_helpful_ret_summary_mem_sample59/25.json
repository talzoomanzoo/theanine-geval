A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience. Speaker A offers to take Sparky for a walk to help out and spend time with the dog. Speaker A is considering getting a dog and already walks Speaker B's dog, Sparky. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n2. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n3. Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule.\n4. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n5. Speaker B loves the beach and Mediterranean food.\n6. Speaker A's schedule at the restaurant includes working doubles on Saturdays and 8-hour shifts on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nThe dialogue context revolves around Speaker B's involvement in a lab related to cloning cows and the discussion about trying different types of burgers, including Beyond burgers or plant-based versions. MEMORY 1 contains relevant information about Speaker B's interest and work related to neuroscience, which is somewhat similar to lab work. This connection could potentially allow Speaker A to expand the conversation about lab experiences or research interests. Meanwhile, MEMORY 2 is mainly focused on Speaker A's restaurant work and lifestyle details, which are not directly relevant to the science or food discussion in the dialogue, aside from possibly bringing up restaurant experiences. However, MEMORY 1 provides a more directly applicable context regarding Speaker B's interests and activities.\n\nChoice: 1"
