Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet as Speaker B received a new car from their mom and plans to drive during spring break.\nSpeaker A, a retired librarian, recommends the book \"Beautiful Ruins\" by Jess Walter for a beach visit, contrasting with Speaker A's quiet spring breaks in the past.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides information about the current interests and plans of Speaker B and a bit of personal history about Speaker A, such as their career background, which can help Speaker A respond more contextually regarding the book topic. It also gives insight into cultural and familial background that may come up in conversation, such as both Speaker A and their mother being librarians, and mentioning both speakers' sense of humor. While MEMORY 1 includes some details such as Speaker B's new car and travel plans, MEMORY 2 is richer as it contains more components, making it more versatile for formulating responses related to both previous travels and book genres, which aligns with the current conversation about books.\n\nChoice: 2"
