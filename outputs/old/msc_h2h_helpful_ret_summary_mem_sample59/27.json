A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal.\nSpeaker B: That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab!\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker B, a high school student preparing for college, works at a diner at night. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner. Speaker A had cheesy ham and potato soup for dinner. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n2. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n3. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n4. Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule.\n5. Speaker B loves the beach and Mediterranean food.\n6. Speaker A's restaurant plays a mix of songs, mainly easy listening, to create a relaxing environment for diners.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides specific information about Speaker B's interests and activities, particularly related to working in a research lab, which directly connects to the ongoing discussion about cloning and scientific experiments. This information could be leveraged by Speaker A to further engage Speaker B by discussing their work in the lab, neuroscience, or their culinary inventions. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 mostly provides details about Speaker A's job and their restaurant environment, which are less relevant to the current topic of conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
