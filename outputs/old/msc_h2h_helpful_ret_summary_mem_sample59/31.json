A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal.\nSpeaker B: That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab!\nSpeaker A: Oh! I did not know that. Well if you can clone cows that's more ice cream for you! Haha. What's your favorite ice cream flavor?\nSpeaker B: Yes, more ice cream is always good, haha! I like a good rocky road, or pretty much any chocolate ice cream with nuts or stir-ins! I like most of Jeni's brand too. How about you? What is your favorite kind?\nSpeaker A: I am a big fan of cookie dough ice cream, and I love cheesecake flavored ice creams too! Ben & Jerry has some that I like, but I prefer to get ice cream from an ice cream shop.  It's just something about being in that environment,\nSpeaker B: Yes, ice cream shops are the best! They have stir-ins, and the smells are heavenly! Ben and Jerry's used to have a blueberry cheesecake that was amazing! I have only had that and their strawberry flavors. Both were great!\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker B works on weekends at a research lab and has a deaf dog named Sparky, a beagle breed. Speaker A is considering getting a dog and already walks Speaker B's dog, Sparky. Speaker B has invented a chili dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\nSpeaker B is also a high school student preparing for college and works at a diner at night. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner, and Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce. Speaker A had cheesy ham and potato soup for dinner, and Speaker B has invented a chili dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n2. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n3. Speaker B loves the beach and Mediterranean food.\n4. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n5. Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule.\n6. Speaker A is an omnivore.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nMEMORY 1 provides more context relevant to the dialogue about Speaker B's interests and activities related to food, such as their work at a diner and their chili dog casserole invention. This memory also references hamburgers, which connects to the earlier conversation about eating cloned meat. Additionally, it mentions that Speaker B is a high school student preparing for college, which can relate to their balancing of school and lab work. These details can be helpful for Speaker A to further engage in conversation about food, cooking, or managing school and work.\n\nMEMORY 2, on the other hand, primarily provides information about Speaker A's work at a restaurant and their general interests, which are less directly related to the dialogue context about cloning and ice cream.\n\nChoice: 1"
