A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker B, as a therapist, discusses the challenges and rewards of the profession.

They express a desire to have a horse in the future and contemplate the psychological aspects of horse ownership through Freudian theories. \nSpeaker A is experienced in horse breeding and care, working at a stable and enjoying being around horses. They transition from their expertise in horses to their lack of knowledge in psychology.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\n3.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides relevant information about Speaker B's background and interests related to being a therapist, including their personal experiences and perspectives, which can contribute to their response in the dialogue context. The memory also connects to Speaker A's interest in horses, which were mentioned in the dialogue, allowing Speaker B to possibly delve further into that topic. In contrast, MEMORY 2 covers unrelated topics such as computer science and linguistics, which do not relate to the context of therapy or horse riding discussed in the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 1"
