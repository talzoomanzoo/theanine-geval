    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides detailed information about Speaker B's involvement in lab work and their interest in neuroscience, which directly relates to the question about working in the lab when they clone the cow. This memory gives context on Speaker B's dedication to lab work and potential changes in their work schedule, which are relevant for continuing the conversation. MEMORY 2 focuses on Speaker A's work at a restaurant, which is unrelated to the lab and thus, not helpful for Speaker B to respond about their plans regarding lab work.\n\nChoice: 1"
