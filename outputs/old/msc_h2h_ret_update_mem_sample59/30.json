    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal.\nSpeaker B: That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab!\nSpeaker A: Oh! I did not know that. Well if you can clone cows that's more ice cream for you! Haha. What's your favorite ice cream flavor?\nSpeaker B: Yes, more ice cream is always good, haha! I like a good rocky road, or pretty much any chocolate ice cream with nuts or stir-ins! I like most of Jeni's brand too. How about you? What is your favorite kind?\nSpeaker A: I am a big fan of cookie dough ice cream, and I love cheesecake flavored ice creams too! Ben & Jerry has some that I like, but I prefer to get ice cream from an ice cream shop.  It's just something about being in that environment, \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: That's true, the atmosphere in an ice cream shop is always special. I think it enhances the whole experience. Do you have a favorite ice cream shop that you like to go to?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: I totally get that! The atmosphere in an ice cream shop really adds to the experience. Cheesecake flavored ice cream sounds amazing, and Ben & Jerry's always has some unique and delicious flavors. Have you ever tried making your own ice cream at home?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response directly recalls a specific past memory because the conversation provided does not include past events, specific visitations, or previously mentioned particular ice cream shops. Both responses reference the atmosphere in an ice cream shop, which ties into the Speaker A's mention of liking to get ice cream from a shop. Response 1 focuses more on whether Speaker A has a favorite ice cream shop, staying true to the immediate topic of conversation. Response 2, while bringing up making ice cream at home and mentioning Ben & Jerry's unique flavors, does not reflect back to any specific past memory regarding home-making ice cream or any prior specific reference to Ben & Jerry's. Since the given conversation does not include any deep past memories or experiences that demand reflection for memorability, both responses are complimentary to the conversationâ€™s flow rather than specific past memory reference.\n\nChoice: tie"
