    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\nSpeaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing? \nSpeaker B: He's doing well! He just finished theatre camp and he's fighting with my sister because he wants to dye his hair green hahaha.\nSpeaker A: Young people today really have different values than our generation had. Acting sounds like it would be personally rewarding. I also like the arts. I play guitar and piano. You mentioned that you have a poll. That sounds refreshing in the hot weather.\nSpeaker B: Yes it's great, but it hasn't stopped raining here! How's the weather where you are? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: The weather here has been pretty mild, not too hot or cold. Hopefully, it clears up for your trip to Costa Rica!\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: It's been sunny here, but we could use some rain to water the garden. Maybe you can bring some of that rain back with you from Costa Rica! Make sure to pack an umbrella just in case.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response reflects past memories significantly, as both responses mainly address the current topic of weather and potential rain during Speaker B's trip to Costa Rica. However, Response 1 slightly relates to Speaker B's upcoming trip by mentioning the hope for clear weather in Costa Rica, which ties back to the trip mentioned earlier. Response 2 introduces the idea of bringing rain back from Costa Rica, which is a bit more playful but doesn't enhance memorability regarding past memories.\n\nChoice: 1"
