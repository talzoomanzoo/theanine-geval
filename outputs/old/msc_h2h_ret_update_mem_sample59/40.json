    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden?\nSpeaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends.\nSpeaker A: That sounds nice! So how is your job going?\nSpeaker B: Always interesting, that's for sure! I have been training to nurse on a new floor, so that'll give me a change of scenery. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: That's exciting! A change of scenery can be refreshing.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: That's exciting! A change of scenery at work can be refreshing. Plus, it's a great way to save some extra money for our Sweden trip.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses mention the excitement of a change of scenery, recognizing Speaker B's job transition. However, Response 2 picks up on Speaker B's earlier conversation about Sweden and cleverly ties it back to the potential for saving money for a Sweden trip, thus recalling their previous discussion more deeply and connecting the present conversation to their shared interest in travel to Sweden. This reflects a stronger Memorability.\n\nChoice: 2"
