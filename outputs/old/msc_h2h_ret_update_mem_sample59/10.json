    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\nSpeaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing? \nSpeaker B: He's doing well! He just finished theatre camp and he's fighting with my sister because he wants to dye his hair green hahaha.\nSpeaker A: Young people today really have different values than our generation had. Acting sounds like it would be personally rewarding. I also like the arts. I play guitar and piano. You mentioned that you have a poll. That sounds refreshing in the hot weather.\nSpeaker B: Yes it's great, but it hasn't stopped raining here! How's the weather where you are?\nSpeaker A: Sorry for the typo. I meant \"pool\". Weather here is very hot and humid. It is miserable if you don't have air conditioning. Pollen count is also very high, so the air quality is poor.  \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: That sounds rough! Hopefully, the weather will improve soon.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: I can imagine how uncomfortable that must be with the humidity and poor air quality. Make sure to stay hydrated and indoors as much as possible. Hopefully, the weather clears up for you soon!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses acknowledge Speaker A's current weather conditions (hot, humid, poor air quality), but neither response recalls past memories explicitly. However, Response 2 demonstrates more engagement and empathy by advising to stay hydrated and indoors, based on the detailed description of the weather provided by Speaker A. This makes it more memorable as it reflects attentiveness to the details shared by Speaker A, even though there is no specific recall of past memories in either response.\n\nChoice: tie"
