    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I agree, it's hard to know for sure where our food comes from. I'll keep working hard in the lab and school.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: I appreciate your kind words! It's definitely a tough decision to balance everything. And you're right, with advancements in technology, it's getting harder to discern where our food comes from. Who knows, maybe one day we'll all be enjoying burgers from cloned cows without even realizing it!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: In this conversation, there are no explicit past memories provided to reference specific previous events. However, we can consider how well the responses reflect the ongoing conversation. Both responses acknowledge the challenge of balancing work and school and the uncertainty regarding the source of our food. Response 1 briefly acknowledges these points but doesn't deeply engage with the themes of difficulty or technology's role in food ambiguity. Response 2, however, expands on the idea introduced by Speaker A and emphasizes the potential future where cloned cow products could become commonplace, enhancing the memorability of the conversation by highlighting technological advancements and uncertainty in food sourcing as mentioned earlier by Speaker A.\n\nChoice: 2"
