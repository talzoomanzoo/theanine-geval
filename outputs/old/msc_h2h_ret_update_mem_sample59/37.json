    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I'm hoping to visit Sweden again soon, maybe this summer. I miss playing tennis and going to church on Sundays there.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: I would love to go back to Sweden someday. I miss the beautiful scenery and the peaceful atmosphere. Maybe I'll save up and join you on your trip to visit your cousin!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: There are no specific past memories provided, so the decision must be based on how well each response reflects the previously mentioned elements of the conversation. Response 1 highlights Speaker B's personal activities in Sweden (playing tennis and going to church), which may suggest a more personal attachment and familiarity with the place. On the other hand, Response 2 connects Speaker B's desire to return to Sweden with Speaker A's trip, proposing a joint visit, which shows a connection to the ongoing conversation about planning trips and spending time with relatives. Both responses reflect elements of the conversation; however, Response 2 provides a stronger tie-in to the current context by mentioning a possible joint trip with Speaker A.\n\nChoice: 2"
