    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I do still enjoy being a therapist, but it definitely has its challenges. It's rewarding to help people navigate through their struggles.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: I do still enjoy it, even after all these years. It can be challenging at times, but it's incredibly rewarding to see the progress and growth in my clients. Plus, it's a field where I can constantly learn and grow myself, which keeps it interesting.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 reflects more on the past memory of why Speaker B decided to become a therapist—helping people navigate their struggles—without introducing new elements. It ties directly back to their initial decision to become a therapist. Response 2 adds additional information that goes beyond the initial premise, introducing new aspects like personal growth and continuous learning. While this could be seen as making the response richer, in terms of sticking to the relevant past memory that Speaker B shared (helping people), Response 1 remains more focused on that past reasoning.\n\nChoice: 1"
