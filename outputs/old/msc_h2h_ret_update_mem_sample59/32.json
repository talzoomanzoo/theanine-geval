    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal.\nSpeaker B: That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab!\nSpeaker A: Oh! I did not know that. Well if you can clone cows that's more ice cream for you! Haha. What's your favorite ice cream flavor?\nSpeaker B: Yes, more ice cream is always good, haha! I like a good rocky road, or pretty much any chocolate ice cream with nuts or stir-ins! I like most of Jeni's brand too. How about you? What is your favorite kind?\nSpeaker A: I am a big fan of cookie dough ice cream, and I love cheesecake flavored ice creams too! Ben & Jerry has some that I like, but I prefer to get ice cream from an ice cream shop.  It's just something about being in that environment,\nSpeaker B: Yes, ice cream shops are the best! They have stir-ins, and the smells are heavenly! Ben and Jerry's used to have a blueberry cheesecake that was amazing! I have only had that and their strawberry flavors. Both were great!\nSpeaker A: YES! You get it. Now I want to go to an ice cream shop. I might apply for a part-time job at an ice cream shop since I'm not working.  Do you enjoy your job as a fry cook? I think the food & restaurant industries may be similar. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I do enjoy working as a fry cook at the diner. It's fast-paced but rewarding. An ice cream shop job sounds fun too! Good luck with your application process!\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: I do enjoy my job as a fry cook! It's fast-paced and keeps me on my toes. Plus, I get to experiment with different flavors and dishes. Working in the food industry definitely has some similarities with the ice cream shop environment you enjoy. It's all about creating a positive experience for the customers through delicious food!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses recall the topic of Speaker B being a fry cook and agree on the similarity between food industry and ice cream shops. However, Response 2 adds an explicit connection to past memories by discussing the shared experience of creating a positive environment for customers, linking back to both the lab work and the enjoyment of ice cream. This adds to the memorability by reflecting on the common theme in their conversation about job satisfaction and customer experience. \n\nChoice: 2"
