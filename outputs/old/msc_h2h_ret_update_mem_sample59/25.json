    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I've tried a Beyond Burger before, and I have to admit, it was surprisingly close to the real thing!\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: I appreciate the vote of confidence! I've actually tried Beyond burgers before and I agree, they're quite close in taste to real beef. It's amazing how far plant-based alternatives have come. I think it's a good option for those looking to reduce their meat consumption.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The current conversation primarily revolves around the topic of cloned cows and plant-based burgers, but there are no past memories provided to recall. Thus, neither response has the opportunity to reflect on previous specific shared experiences or conversations. Given the criterion of Memorability, there is no information to leverage for a response to be deemed more memorable based on past interactions.\n\nChoice: tie"
