    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\nSpeaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk?\nSpeaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous.\nSpeaker B: That sounds amazing! Did you bring a pet? I love doing the harder trails with my dog. Sometimes, it's very peaceful to get away from everything. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I didn't bring a pet this time, but I can imagine how peaceful it must be to have a furry companion on the trail with you.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: I didn't bring a pet this time, but I can imagine how nice it must be to explore the trails with a furry companion. It's so refreshing to disconnect from the hustle and bustle of the city and just immerse yourself in nature. I find it really inspiring, just like you do with your artwork.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nThe current conversation does not mention anything about Speaker B's artwork directly or relate to past memories. However, Response 2 introduces the idea of inspiration from nature in the context of someone's artwork, which may indicate a deeper ongoing context or shared past experiences relating to Speaker B's artistic pursuits. Though this isn't explicitly linked to a past memory given to us, it suggests a more personalized and potentially memorable reflection of the speaker's interests. Response 1 is more straightforward and directly relevant to the current conversation about the nature walk and pets, but it doesn't add any specific past context or personalization.\n\nChoice: 2"
