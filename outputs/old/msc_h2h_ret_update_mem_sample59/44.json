Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I've always been interested in helping others and psychology, so becoming a therapist felt like a natural fit for me.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: I've always been fascinated by the human mind and behavior. I wanted to help people navigate through their struggles and find a way to lead happier, more fulfilling lives. It's a rewarding profession that allows me to make a positive impact on others.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response specifically recalls past memories, as there is no explicit mention of a shared memory or previous conversation between Speaker A and Speaker B in the context provided. Both responses provide Speaker B's personal reasoning for becoming a therapist, but without past memories to reference, neither response can be deemed more memorable than the other based on the memorability criterion alone.\n\nChoice: tie"
