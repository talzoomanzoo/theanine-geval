Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I've been looking into flights and accommodations, trying to find the best deals.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: I've been researching flights and accommodations to find the best deals. I'm also looking into budget-friendly activities to do while we're there. It's coming along, but I still need to save up a bit more before we can book everything.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nNeither response directly recalls any specific past memories related to conversations or experiences. However, Response 2 provides more detailed information about the current state of trip planning and includes additional elements like budget-friendly activities and saving up, which adds depth to the conversation and may help create a more memorable discussion in an ongoing sense. There is no explicit mention of past memories that would make one response stand out in terms of recalling previously mentioned information. Given the current conversation, both responses fit well, but Response 2 is slightly more comprehensive.\n\nChoice: 2"
