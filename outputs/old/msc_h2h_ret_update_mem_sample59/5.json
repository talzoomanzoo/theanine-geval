    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: \"The Gettysburg Campaign\" is about the pivotal battle during the American Civil War. It's a fascinating look at the strategies and key figures involved.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: \"The Gettysburg Campaign\" is a fascinating account of one of the most critical moments in the Civil War. It delves into the strategies and battles that shaped the outcome of the war. If you're not into history, I would recommend a different genre for you.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: There are no past memories provided to recall in this conversation, as the current conversation has been ongoing without any references to previous discussions or shared memories. Therefore, both responses are based entirely on the present interaction. Both Response 1 and Response 2 appropriately follow up on Speaker B’s query about the book. However, Response 2 adds a consideration for Speaker B's stated disinterest in history, suggesting an awareness of the other speaker’s preferences. This could be seen as a reflection of the immediate conversational context, enhancing the personal connection.\n\nChoice: 2"
