    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\nSpeaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk?\nSpeaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: The river trail sounds lovely. I always enjoy being near the water.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: That sounds lovely! I always enjoy walks by rivers. Did you come across any interesting wildlife or plant life along the trail?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "As the given task is to choose a response based on memorability by reflecting on past memories, it's important to note that no specific past memories are provided in the task. Instead, everything we have are the given past conversation and the current exchange between A and B.\n\nGiven that both options use the same reference to rivers, neither adds new information associated with past memories. However, Response 2 adds memorability by asking about wildlife and plant life, potentially relating to shared interests or past conversations about nature that might not be explicitly provided here.\n\nExplanation: While neither response specifically recalls past memories from the conversation or implies specific shared past experiences, Response 2 makes an effort to extend the conversation around nature, potentially invoking shared interests that weren't explicitly mentioned in this past memory. This can result in a more memorable interaction in the context of general nature-related interests.\n\nChoice: 2"
