    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\nSpeaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car?\nSpeaker B: Yes, there are several. Hope we could meet and You possibly teach me about computer programming.\nSpeaker A: That would be great too. I like to program in several different languages. Do you have a preference? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I don't have a preference yet, but I'm eager to learn more about them.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: I'm still exploring different languages, but I find Python quite interesting so far. It would be amazing to learn more about it from you while cruising.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: In the conversation, Speaker A mentions their enjoyment of programming in different languages and asks Speaker B if they have a preference. Response 2 specifically mentions Python as a language Speaker B has found interesting, adding depth to the conversation and showing that Speaker B has given thought to their programming journey. This response reflects an ongoing exploration and implies past engagement with programming languages. It connects well with Speaker A's interest in different programming languages and builds upon the current topic, increasing its memorability. Response 1 is more generic and doesn't refer back to any specific past memory that can be inferred from the conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
