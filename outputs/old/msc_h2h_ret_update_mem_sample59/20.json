    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\nSpeaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car?\nSpeaker B: Yes, there are several. Hope we could meet and You possibly teach me about computer programming.\nSpeaker A: That would be great too. I like to program in several different languages. Do you have a preference?\nSpeaker B: No, I'm just getting started so I don't have a preference. Maybe you could show me what you prefer and we could start there. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: Perfect, we can start with Python, it's a great language to begin with. I'll show you the basics.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: Sure, I'd be happy to show you some different programming languages. We can start with something beginner-friendly like Python or JavaScript. Once you get the hang of it, we can explore more advanced languages together. It's going to be a fun learning journey!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The conversation mainly revolves around Speaker A teaching Speaker B about swimming and programming, with a potential future trip to the Caribbean. Speaker B expresses an interest in learning programming. Both responses talk about introducing Speaker B to programming languages, but Response 2 includes a wider variety of options—mentioning both Python and JavaScript—and acknowledges a progression in learning, reflecting a longer-term memory of their shared interest in learning programming together. It also aligns more with their ongoing conversation about learning together.\n\nChoice: 2"
