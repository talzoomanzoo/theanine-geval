    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal.\nSpeaker B: That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab!\nSpeaker A: Oh! I did not know that. Well if you can clone cows that's more ice cream for you! Haha. What's your favorite ice cream flavor? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I love mint chocolate chip ice cream! It's so refreshing and has just the right amount of sweetness. What about you, what's your favorite flavor?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: Haha, more ice cream for me indeed! My favorite ice cream flavor is definitely mint chocolate chip. There's just something so refreshing about it, especially after a long day in the lab. Have you tried it before?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response explicitly recalls specific past memories as none were provided. However, both responses engage directly with the current conversation about ice cream preferences. Response 2 further develops on the conversation by linking the enjoyment of mint chocolate chip ice cream to the context of working in the lab, slightly extending the theme of their discussion about lab work which makes it more contextual and engaging, enhancing memorability in this current scenario.\n\nChoice: 2"
