It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you  \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Thank you, I appreciate your willingness to teach me how to swim. I'm excited for our meetup this weekend!\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: That's awesome! I can't wait to learn from you. And after our swimming lesson, we can enjoy that pizza burger in the pool with some punk music blasting in the background. It's going to be a perfect day.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither of the responses references any specific past memories. Both responses are forward-looking and do not allude to any shared experiences or past events that were previously discussed or experienced together. Response 2 adds more detail and imagery to the upcoming meetup, but these details don't reflect a specific past memory that was mentioned. As a result, both responses have equal levels of Memorability in the context given.\n\nChoice: tie"
