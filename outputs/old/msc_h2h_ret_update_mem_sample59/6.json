    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\nSpeaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing?  \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: He's doing well, thank you for asking. He's getting ready for his birthday, and he's excited to finally be a teenager.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: He's doing well, thanks for asking! He's getting ready for his 14th birthday, and he's so excited. I still need to figure out what to get him as a gift. Do you have any suggestions for a teenage boy?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "The task requires evaluating responses based on the reflection of past memories, but in this context, there is no provided context of past memories involving Speaker B's nephew. Both responses discuss the nephew's birthday, but neither connects to any known past memories from the given texts. They equally reflect the current conversation thread about the nephew, but since there are no specific past memories to recall for memorability enhancement, both responses are essentially equal in this regard.\n\nChoice: tie"
