    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\nSpeaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I enjoy cruising to nearby cities like Savannah or Charleston. They have charming vibes.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: I've always wanted to explore New Orleans. The music scene there is incredible, and I've heard the food is amazing. It would be a great stop on a cruise trip.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses provide potential destinations near a cruise, which fit with Speaker A's city-based question, but neither response references any specific past memory from the conversation. However, Response 2 contains slightly more detail which could be seen as more memorable by tying in the interests in punk music mentioned earlier â€“ New Orleans is a city known for its vibrant music scene. While this isn't directly recalling past memories, it is somewhat tangentially related to earlier interests in the conversation.\nChoice: 2"
