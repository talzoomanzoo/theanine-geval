    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden?\nSpeaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends.\nSpeaker A: That sounds nice! So how is your job going? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Work is going well, thanks for asking. Just trying to save up for that next trip to Sweden!\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: Work is going well, thanks for asking! I'm trying to save up for my next trip to Sweden, so I've been putting in some extra hours. It'll be worth it to experience those beautiful volcanoes again.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: There are no memories or mentions of volcanoes in the conversation or past memories, making RESPONSE 2 incorrect as it misremembers the conversation's context by introducing volcanoes instead of castles or beaches. RESPONSE 1, on the other hand, correctly recalls the context of saving for a trip to Sweden, consistent with Speaker B's previous mention of returning next summer and enjoying beach spots with friends.\n\nChoice: 1"
