    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: Definitely, I'd be curious to try it! It would be interesting to see if there's any difference in taste.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: Absolutely, I would definitely try a hamburger from a cloned cow! It's fascinating to think about the advancements in science and how it can potentially revolutionize the food industry. Your work in the lab must be so intriguing, especially with your interest in molecular biology.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response reflects past memories as there is no mention of any specific past events or shared experiences between the speakers in the past memories section. However, Response 2 does make an indirect reference to potentially shared knowledge or assumptions about Speaker B's interests and academic pursuits, such as the mention of molecular biology, which suggests some familiarity with Speaker B's educational background or interests. This is slightly more reflective of past memories than Response 1, which is more general and lacks any deep reflection on the specifics of Speaker B's context or experiences.\n\nChoice: 2"
