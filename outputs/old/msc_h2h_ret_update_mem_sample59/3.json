How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I'm doing well, thank you for asking.

How about you, any new books on your reading list?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: I'm doing well, thank you! I recently finished \"Beautiful Ruins\" by Jess Walter. It's a perfect beach read with a captivating storyline. Have you heard of it?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "As the task description does not provide any past memories related to the conversation, a proper analysis of memorability based on recalling past memories cannot be carried out effectively. However, based on the conversation provided, neither response accesses any specific prior memory shared between Speaker A and Speaker B within the limited context given. \n\nChoice: tie"
