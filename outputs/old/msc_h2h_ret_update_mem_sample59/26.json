    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I totally get what you mean. It's always good to be informed about what we're eating. Would you be up for trying a plant-based burger together sometime?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: That's totally understandable. It's always good to be cautious and informed about what we're consuming. Plant-based options are a great alternative, and it's always fun to try new things. Maybe one day you can try my chili dog casserole too, it's a unique dish that might surprise you!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither of the responses directly reflects or recalls any past memories since no specific past events or experiences were mentioned earlier in the conversation. Both responses build on the current conversation of trying plant-based foods and understanding more about what they consume. However, Response 2's mention of trying a \"chili dog casserole\" introduces a new idea or potentially a past memory of Speaker B's cooking experience or favorite dish, which increases the chance for Memorability.\n\nChoice: 2"
