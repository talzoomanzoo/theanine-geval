    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: That would be awesome! I'll make sure there's some time for swimming and programming on the cruise too.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: That would be awesome! Imagine swimming in the pool, enjoying a pizza burger, with punk music playing in the background. I'll make sure you have a great time, even if it's your first cruise.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response directly references specific past memories, as there are not enough given past memories to incorporate. However, Response 2 provides more detailed imagery that enhances the memorability of the future event being planned (a cruise), by creating a vivid picture of what the experience could be like. It also ties the current plans of swimming, listening to punk music, and possibly having food all together in an upcoming event, which could be a memorable aspect of the conversation for Speaker B if they have not been on a cruise before.\n\nChoice: 2"
