    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\nSpeaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing? \nSpeaker B: He's doing well! He just finished theatre camp and he's fighting with my sister because he wants to dye his hair green hahaha.\nSpeaker A: Young people today really have different values than our generation had. Acting sounds like it would be personally rewarding. I also like the arts. I play guitar and piano. You mentioned that you have a poll. That sounds refreshing in the hot weather. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Yes, having a pool will definitely be a lifesaver in the warm Costa Rican weather! Speaking of green hair, I hope your nephew wins that battle with your sister. Oh, and I'm sure you'll enjoy the beach in Costa Rica, especially with that book you recommended.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: Playing guitar and piano must be so fun! It's great to have music as a hobby. I bet you have some great stories from your days as a librarian too!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 1 references several details from the previous conversation, such as having a pool, which was mentioned by Speaker A, the green hair of Speaker B's nephew, which was previously mentioned and connected to a humorous anecdote, and Speaker A's enjoyment of reading, specifically relating to a recent book discussion. Although it slightly misattributes the book's genre to be suitable for a beach read, it demonstrates a stronger and broader reflection of past memories. Response 2, on the other hand, mentions a new topic (being a librarian) that wasn't discussed previously and does not tie back as well to specific past memories from the conversation thread.\n\nChoice: 1"
