    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job! \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: It's great that you found a career that aligns with your passion for helping others. Do you find that being a therapist is rewarding?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: That's really admirable. It must be fulfilling to make a positive impact on people's lives.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nNeither response explicitly reflects any specific past memories, as the past memories were not provided. However, both responses successfully connect to Speaker B's expression of passion for helping others. Both responses address the notion of fulfillment and reward in regard to Speaker B's chosen career, thus appropriately engaging with the current context of the conversation. Since the criterion is Memorability, which relies on recalling specific past memories, and neither response does this distinctly, it's a tie based on the information provided.\n\nChoice: tie"
