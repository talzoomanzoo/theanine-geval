    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: No, I've never been to the Caribbean, but it sounds like a fantastic place to visit. I'm looking forward to learning how to swim and programming with your guidance.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: No, I haven't been to the Caribbean. It sounds amazing, but I'm still a bit hesitant about cruises because I can't swim.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response recalls past memories or prior conversations that would impact the memorability of the response. However, Response 2 more strongly aligns with the current conversation context by recognizing Speaker B's hesitancy about swimming, which was a topic mentioned earlier when discussing Speaker A teaching Speaker B to swim. This subtle acknowledgement of the previous mention of not knowing how to swim gives Response 2 a slight edge in terms of connecting back to prior conversation points, enhancing its memorability by reinforcing Speaker B's concerns that were mentioned earlier.\n\nChoice: 2"
