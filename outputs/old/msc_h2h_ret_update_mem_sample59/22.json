    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting! \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Definitely! I'm looking forward to seeing how the cloning process unfolds.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: Definitely! I'm eager to see how advancements in molecular biology will impact the field of agriculture. It's an exciting time to be involved in research.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are focused on Speaker B's excitement about the cloning project, but they vary in their depth. Response 1 is more straightforward, expressing a general eagerness to witness the cloning process. However, Response 2 not only acknowledges the excitement about the cloning but also ties it to broader advancements in molecular biology and their implications for agriculture. This makes Response 2 more reflective of the potential implications of past scientific developments on present projects, thus making it more memorable by connecting the current project to a broader scientific context.\n\nChoice: 2"
