A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\nSpeaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing? \nSpeaker B: He's doing well! He just finished theatre camp and he's fighting with my sister because he wants to dye his hair green hahaha.\nSpeaker A: Young people today really have different values than our generation had. Acting sounds like it would be personally rewarding. I also like the arts. I play guitar and piano. You mentioned that you have a poll. That sounds refreshing in the hot weather.\nSpeaker B: Yes it's great, but it hasn't stopped raining here! How's the weather where you are?\nSpeaker A: Sorry for the typo. I meant \"pool\". Weather here is very hot and humid. It is miserable if you don't have air conditioning. Pollen count is also very high, so the air quality is poor. \n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation. Speaker A jokes about the inevitability of grey hair, finding getting old no fun. Speaker B's new dress is blue, but more of a turquoise shade, contrasting with Speaker A's quiet spring breaks in the past. Speaker B dyed their hair with henna and enjoys experimenting with different hair colors, excited about Easter weekend and spring break. Speaker A's granddaughter, who is a cosmetologist, helped dye their hair in streaks.\n\nMEMORY 2\nUser Description:\nSpeaker A is a retired individual with a quiet nature who enjoys nature. They have eight grandchildren and have recently dyed their hair turquoise, considering other colors like purple and blue. Speaker A's daughter is passionate about cosmetology and plans to start her own salon. Speaker A is interested in book recommendations for a beach visit.\n\nRelationship Description:\nThe relationship between Speaker A and Speaker B is friendly and casual, with discussions about hair dyeing, car purchases, and book recommendations. Speaker B is supportive of Speaker A's decisions and offers suggestions for hair color and car choices.\n\nEvent Description:\nEvents shared by Speaker A and Speaker B include discussions about hair dyeing, with Speaker A getting help from their grandkids, and details about Speaker A's daughter's passion for cosmetology. Speaker B also shares their preference for last-minute decisions and their new black car purchase. Additionally, book recommendations for a beach visit are exchanged between the two speakers.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nBoth memories provide background information that could potentially be helpful in responding to the current dialogue context. However, MEMORY 2 provides more relevant information that can be directly related to the dialogue in terms of the interests discussed, such as hair dyeing and book recommendations. Speaker B might relate to Speaker A’s interest in dyeing hair and the casual discussions they have had in the past, helping to foster the kind of conversational exchange being depicted in the current dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 2"
