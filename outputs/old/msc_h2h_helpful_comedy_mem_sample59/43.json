I have been training to nurse on a new floor, so that'll give me a change of scenery.\nSpeaker A: Does that add a lot of extra work to your plate?\nSpeaker B: At the moment, yes.

Speaker A is also interested in jamband music and classic reggae. Speaker B misses Sweden and has many great memories there.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The key to choosing the more helpful MEMORY lies in the details that connect directly with the Dialogue Context, especially regarding the topic of interest they're discussing - Sweden and Speaker B's job. MEMORY 2 provides a richer background related to both Sweden and Speaker B's work, mentioning Speaker B's parents live in Sweden and that they have a flexible job at the hospital. Also, it provides context on their shared love for coffee shops and music and Speaker B's nostalgic feelings about Sweden, offering possible directions for continued conversation. MEMORY 1 is less directly related, focusing more on travel plans and has redundant information about planning a trip together, which doesn't align with the current dialogue context. Overall, MEMORY 2 offers broader conversational hooks relevant to both primary topics in the dialogue: Sweden and Speaker B's job.\n\nChoice: 2"
