A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal.\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker A enjoys running and listening to music as hobbies. Speaker A offers to take Sparky for a walk to help out and spend time with the dog. Speaker A is considering getting a dog and already walks Speaker B's dog, Sparky.

Speaker B has also shared information about their night job cooking hamburgers and feeding lab rats at a research lab.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a more comprehensive context for Speaker B’s situation and relationship with Speaker A. It not only includes the fact that Speaker B has a night job cooking hamburgers and feeds lab rats at a research lab, which is directly relevant to the dialogue context about cloning cows and working in the lab, but also emphasizes their shared meals and close relationship. MEMORY 1, while it gives some relevant information like the involvement in lab research, does not provide as detailed a background on their interactions and shared interests related to the dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 2"
