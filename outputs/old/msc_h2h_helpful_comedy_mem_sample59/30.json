A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal.\nSpeaker B: That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab!\nSpeaker A: Oh! I did not know that. Well if you can clone cows that's more ice cream for you! Haha. What's your favorite ice cream flavor?\nSpeaker B: Yes, more ice cream is always good, haha! I like a good rocky road, or pretty much any chocolate ice cream with nuts or stir-ins! I like most of Jeni's brand too. How about you? What is your favorite kind?\nSpeaker A: I am a big fan of cookie dough ice cream, and I love cheesecake flavored ice creams too! Ben & Jerry has some that I like, but I prefer to get ice cream from an ice cream shop.  It's just something about being in that environment,\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker B works at a diner at night and Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B. Speaker A had cheesy ham and potato soup for dinner. Speaker B has invented a chili dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try. \nSpeaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research. \nSpeaker B, a high school student preparing for college, works at a diner at night. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n\nMEMORY 2\nUser Description: Speaker A is a high school student who is going to college, has achieved straight A's, runs a lot, likes burgers after a run, listens to music on weekends, finds listening to music like meditation, and needs music to stay sane. Their parents are blue collar workers, with their dad working long hours in factories. \n\nRelationship Description: Speaker A and Speaker B share a close relationship, discussing topics like getting a dog, dogs with hearing issues, and sharing meals like hamburgers and ham soup.\n\nEvent Description: Speaker A and Speaker B have engaged in conversations about getting a dog, discussing the challenges of having dogs with hearing issues, sharing meals like hamburgers and ham soup, and joking about trying a casserole invented by Speaker B. Speaker B has also shared information about their night job cooking hamburgers and feeding lab rats at a research lab.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides specific details about Speaker B's work and interests that are directly related to the ongoing conversation about cloning, lab work, and hamburgers. Speaker B's involvement in both diner cooking and lab research is relevant, and it foregrounds Speaker B's interest in neuroscience, which aligns with the cloning discussion. MEMORY 2 contains broader personal details about Speaker A, their family background, and past conversations that are less directly relevant to the current topic of cloning and hamburgers.\n\nChoice: 1"
