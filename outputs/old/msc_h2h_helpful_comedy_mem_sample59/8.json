A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\nSpeaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing? \nSpeaker B: He's doing well! He just finished theatre camp and he's fighting with my sister because he wants to dye his hair green hahaha.\nSpeaker A: Young people today really have different values than our generation had. Acting sounds like it would be personally rewarding. I also like the arts. I play guitar and piano. You mentioned that you have a poll. That sounds refreshing in the hot weather.\n\nMEMORY 1\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation, despite Speaker B turning 29 next week.\n2. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one; hence, Speaker A, a retired librarian, recommends the book \"Beautiful Ruins\" by Jess Walter for a beach visit.\n3. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break, wanting to go on a trip but has not started packing yet.\n\nMEMORY 2\nUser Description:\nSpeaker A is a retired individual with a quiet nature who enjoys nature. They have eight grandchildren and have recently dyed their hair turquoise, considering other colors like purple and blue. Speaker A's daughter is passionate about cosmetology and plans to start her own salon. Speaker A is interested in book recommendations for a beach visit.\n\nRelationship Description:\nThe relationship between Speaker A and Speaker B is friendly and casual, with discussions about hair dyeing, car purchases, and book recommendations. Speaker B is supportive of Speaker A's decisions and offers suggestions for hair color and car choices.\n\nEvent Description:\nEvents shared by Speaker A and Speaker B include discussions about hair dyeing, with Speaker A getting help from their grandkids, and details about Speaker A's daughter's passion for cosmetology. Speaker B also shares their preference for last-minute decisions and their new black car purchase. Additionally, book recommendations for a beach visit are exchanged between the two speakers.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context involves Speaker A and Speaker B discussing travel plans, book preferences, and family activities. Memory 2 provides detailed information about the nature of Speaker A, specifically their interest in book recommendations and family-oriented activities, which are relevant to their mention of historical books and knowing about Speaker B's family (nephew). It also touches on casual, supportive discussions which align with Speaker B showing interest in Speaker A's book choices. In contrast, Memory 1 focuses more on Speaker B's excitement about travel and humor but lacks direct ties to the conversation's historical and familial themes, reducing its relevance in this particular context.\n\nChoice: 2"
