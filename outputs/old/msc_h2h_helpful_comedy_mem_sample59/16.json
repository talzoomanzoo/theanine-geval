A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker B, who does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies, reacted positively when Speaker A offered to teach them how to swim and programming. Speaker A's plan to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination changed as they signed up for several trips. This led to Speaker A planning a snorkeling trip and looking forward to traveling to the Caribbean for their next trip. Additionally, Speaker B expressed their enjoyment of cruising in their car while listening to punk music, which sparked a conversation about the potential of Speaker A and Speaker B getting on a cruise ship together.\n\nMEMORY 2\nUser Description:\nSpeaker B is a shipping clerk at a warehouse, working 15 hours a week. They enjoy watching swimming movies and their favorite food is pizzaburger. Speaker B dislikes swimming. Their profile includes information about their occupation, likes, and favorite food.\n\nRelationship Description:\nSpeaker B and Speaker A have discussed various topics such as cruising, programming, swimming, and food preferences. Speaker B is supportive of Speaker A's new job and appreciates the welcoming environment at work. They have agreed on a deal to learn swimming and programming together.\n\nEvent Description:\nEvents shared by Speaker B and Speaker A include planning a cruise, discussing fears related to cruises, Speaker A's first day at a new job in computer programming, planning snorkeling trips, discussing the cure for fears through immersion, and making plans to meet up next weekend for swimming and programming lessons. Speaker B enjoys eating pizzaburgers when stressed and is interested in learning programming. Speaker A finds their job rewarding but tedious and offers to teach Speaker B programming. Both speakers bond over their shared interests in swimming, programming, and food preferences.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides more extensive information that can benefit Speaker A in continuing the conversation. It details their shared interests in programming and swimming, Speaker B's support for Speaker A's job, and their agreement to learn swimming and programming together. This information can help Speaker A make connections to shared activities and interests, as well as suggest future conversations or plans. On the other hand, MEMORY 1, while it contains relevant information about their shared interest in swimming and cruising, does not offer as much depth in terms of other shared interests and details of their past interactions, which limits its helpfulness.\n\nChoice: 2"
