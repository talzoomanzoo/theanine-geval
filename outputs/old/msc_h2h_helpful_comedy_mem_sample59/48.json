Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker B enjoys being a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs, and also mentions the ups and downs of the profession. Speaker B is concerned about the cost of owning horses, including medical fees and expenses like horse shoes.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 offers specific details about Speaker A's background and current situation, including their feelings towards therapy, their relationship with their husband, and insights into their father's mental health. It also provides relevant data about Speaker B's professional experience in therapy, and family dynamics, making it pertinent to the dialogue regarding the potential impact of therapy and addressing family absence. Moreover, it mentions the potential psychological implications of wanting a horse which aligns with Speaker A's way of finding therapy in horse riding. This aligns more closely with the concerns expressed by Speaker A in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about unresolved childhood trauma and suggests potential topics for therapy, making it more helpful for Speaker B's responses. MEMORY 1, while mentioning the therapist's enjoyment of their job and interest in horses, lacks such details that directly connect with the dialogue's focus on personal and therapeutic contexts.\n\nChoice: 2"
