Response 1 maintains consistency by acknowledging the teamwork between the two co-workers without introducing any new or conflicting information. In contrast, Response 2 introduces a reference to a \"Parent,\" which is inconsistent with the current conversation context of co-workers. The introduction of \"Parent\" is inconsistent as it does not align with the roles of the individuals engaged in this conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
