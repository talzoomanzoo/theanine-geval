Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers A: That sounds like quite the daring plan! Just make sure it's all in good fun and doesn't cause any trouble.\nRESPONSE 2\nUnknown: It's amazing how time can really change your perspective on things.

    "prediction": "Explanation: \nThe choice doesn't seem to hinge on any previously shared memories, but on how the conversation unfolds. Neither response directly invokes past memories. However, Response 1 is more closely tied to the conversation as it humorously engages with the plan being discussed. Response 2, while reflective, does not seem directly related to the current context of the conversation concerning the bride, making Response 1 slightly more appropriate if there were any relevant past conversations about similar funny or daring plans.\n\nChoice: 1"
