Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it.\nCo-workers B: That's not the same thing, Co-workers A. Stealing someone and keeping them against their will is illegal and immoral. You need to let go of this obsession and move on. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers A: I know you're right, Co-worker B. I'll try to let go of this obsession and respect her choices. Thanks for being honest with me.\nRESPONSE 2\nUnknown: Absolutely, our friendship means the world to me. It's amazing how much we've both grown and evolved over the years. I'm so grateful to have you in my life as a friend and neighbor.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",

    "memory_text": "- Co-worker A felt guilty about borrowing a pencil from Co-worker B without asking, similar to how they intervened to separate two women in a fight.\n- Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that intervening in the fight was not a big deal and suggested making it up by buying coffee next time, showing their supportive nature.\n- Co-worker A's bravery and willingness to help were commended by Co-worker B, who admires their resilience and positivity, even in challenging situations like the accident where they lost their hands and feet.",

    "prediction": "Explanation: The current conversation is centered around Co-workers A and B discussing Co-worker A's plan to steal someone away whom he loves, using a past memory where Co-worker A borrowed a pencil without asking as an analogy. Response 1 directly addresses this conversation by showing Co-worker A acknowledging Co-worker B's argument, which reflects on the past memory of taking the pencil without permission, thereby connecting to the earlier part of the conversation. Response 2, on the other hand, brings up a completely unrelated topic about friendship and personal growth, which does not recall any past memories relevant to the current conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
