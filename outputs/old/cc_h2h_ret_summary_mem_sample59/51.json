Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today?\nCo-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing.\nCo-workers A: Do you need any help? I don't want you to get overwhelmed.\nCo-workers B: That's really nice of you, but I don't want to burden you with my work. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers A: I understand, but I'm here if you change your mind.

    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response directly references past memories mentioned in the prompts since no specific past memories exist. However, in terms of context and the current conversation, Response 1 fits the dialogue more appropriately. It maintains the supportive offer from Co-worker A to Co-worker B, furthering the context of the existing conversation. Response 2 introduces an \"Unknown\" individual and a congratulatory note unrelated to the conversation, thus reducing its relevance and memorability in this context.\n\nChoice: 1"
