Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it.\nCo-workers B: That's not the same thing, Co-workers A. Stealing someone and keeping them against their will is illegal and immoral. You need to let go of this obsession and move on.\nCo-workers A: I know you're right, Co-workers B. I just don't know how to get over this feeling. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers B: It's understandable that you're struggling, Co-worker A. Have you considered talking to someone or seeking professional help to work through these emotions?\nRESPONSE 2\nUnknown: I'm sure you'll make new friends and create great memories in your new neighborhood. Change can be refreshing, and I'm excited to see how you'll flourish in this new environment.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",

    "memory_text": "Co-worker B showed a willingness to assist others by helping a customer resolve an issue last week, which reflects their supportive nature. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it, similar to the feeling of guilt when Co-worker A spoke with the police about an incident. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and suggested making it up by buying coffee next time, showing their supportive and understanding nature.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The conversation is between Co-workers A and B discussing a personal issue related to Co-workers A's feelings about someone they care for and how they're expressing those feelings in an unhealthy way. Response 1 is relevant to the past conversation and picks up on Co-worker A's admissions of guilt and confusion about their feelings, suggesting a proactive step forward by considering professional help. This response is directly tied to the conversation and its themes, reflecting past exchanges about feelings and appropriate actions. Response 2, on the other hand, does not draw on any part of the past conversation and instead introduces an unrelated new topic about moving and making new friends, which does not contribute to the memorability of the ongoing discussion.\n\nChoice: 1"
