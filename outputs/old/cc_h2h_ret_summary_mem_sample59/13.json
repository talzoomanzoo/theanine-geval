    "prediction": "Explanation: \nNeither response directly references any past memories as there are none provided. Both responses offer general advice on making new connections and building friendships in a new city. However, Response 2 adds a bit more depth by suggesting the mentee should focus on self-care during this transition period, which is an additional empathetic touch that could be memorable if self-care was ever a topic of discussion in their past interactions. \n\nChoice: tie"
