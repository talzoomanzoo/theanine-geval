    "prediction": "Explanation: \nBoth responses address the Mentee's feeling of loneliness in a new city, acknowledging that it is normal to feel that way. Both also assure the Mentee that forming new friendships takes time. However, neither response reflects any specific past memories or shared experiences between the Mentor and the Mentee. The fact that the speaker is identified as \"Mentor\" in Response 1 adds a slightly more personal touch since it matches the speaker in the current conversation, as opposed to \"Unknown\" in Response 2. However, this is a subtle difference and does not significantly impact the memorability based on past memories, as no specific past memories are referenced in either response. Thus, they are almost equal in relation to memorability.\n\nChoice: tie"
