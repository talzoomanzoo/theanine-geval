    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response directly reflects past memories as none are provided. However, Response 1 is more relevant to the current conversation about workload between co-workers. Response 2 appears to be an unrelated topic introduction about artificial intelligence. Given the criterion of memorability requiring the recalling of past memories, and the lack of such references, the choice does not heavily rely on memorability.\n\nChoice: 1"
