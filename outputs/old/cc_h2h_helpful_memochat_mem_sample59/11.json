    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 primarily focuses on the mentor-mentee relationship concerning career guidance and the decision-making process, with a brief mention of the mentee moving to a new city for a job. It lacks details and strategies related to the mentee's current emotional struggle with loneliness. MEMORY 2, however, provides a detailed example of mentor support in a stressful situation (college application stress), including reassurance and advice. This is more helpful because it highlights the mentor's approach to emotional support and advice delivery, which can be extended and adapted to the mentee's current feeling of loneliness in a new city.\n\nChoice: 2"
