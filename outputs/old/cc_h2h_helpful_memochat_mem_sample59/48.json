    "prediction": "Apologies, I'll reassess the messages and proceed with the evaluation.\n\nExplanation: MEMORY 2 provides richer, more specific context about Co-worker A's health issues, including a recent fall and ongoing feelings of dizziness and disorientation. This directly relates to Co-worker A's need for support and could inform Co-worker B's response in a way that considers Co-worker A's health concerns. MEMORY 1 mostly centers around gratitude for horse-related aspects and general support, which is less pertinent to addressing Co-worker A's immediate condition.\n\nChoice: 2"
