    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 provides information about the friendly relationship between the neighbors and how they plan to hang out regularly, which is relevant to the current conversation because it establishes the context of their usual interactions and friendships. However, Memory 2 is more helpful because it specifically includes Neighbor A expressing a desire to spend more time together and specifically references planning a movie night. This is directly relevant because it can be a way for Neighbor A to make amends and re-establish their friendly bond after the incident.\n\nChoice: 2"
