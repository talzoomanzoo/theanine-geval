    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 is more directly related to the dialogue context as it mentions the mentor's reassurance about starting over being tough, which aligns with the current context where the mentee is feeling lonely in a new city. MEMORY 1 also provides information on the mentee's past experiences and character development, which could be useful for the mentor to draw parallels or provide specific encouragement based on previous positive outcomes. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, focuses on college application stress, which, while related to feeling overwhelmed, does not address loneliness or moving to a new city. It lacks direct relevance to the current emotional situation and context of the mentee.\n\nChoice: 1"
