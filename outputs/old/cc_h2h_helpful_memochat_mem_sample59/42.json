I'm just glad no one got seriously hurt. ### Co-workers B: Did you get the chance to talk to the police about what happened? ### Co-workers A: Yeah, they arrived soon after and took care of the situation. The women were grateful and thanked me for breaking up the fight. ### Co-workers B: That must have been a relief. It's good to see that there are still people like you who are willing to help out in those kinds of situations. ### Co-workers A: Thanks, I appreciate that.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a richer context related to intervention, bravery, and the importance of not taking actions that could harm others, which is directly relevant to the situation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Co-worker A's previous experience of stepping in during a responsible situation could help reinforce the idea that \"stealing\" someone is improper. On the other hand, MEMORY 1 provides unrelated topics concerning issues about borrowing an item and positive traits with less relevance to the current dialogue about preventing a marriage in an unethical way.\n\nChoice: 2"
