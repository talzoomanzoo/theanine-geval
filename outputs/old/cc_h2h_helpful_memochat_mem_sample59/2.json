But sometimes it's okay to ask for help if you really need it. ### Parent: I know, and I've definitely had to learn that lesson the hard way. Like when I got arrested and had to rely on a lawyer and the justice system to help me out. ### Child: Yeah, that was a really tough time for both of us. ### Parent: But I'm glad we made it through together.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 focuses on the mutual support and love present between the parent and child and their shared efforts to create a safe and stable environment. It aligns with the current dialogue context which discusses the importance of listening, emotional support, and making life changes—an extension of providing a safe and stable environment. MEMORY 2, while discussing self-sufficiency and experiences of relying on others, is less directly related to the current theme of listening and emotional support.\n\nChoice: 1"
