    "prediction": "Explanation: \nThe DIALOGUE CONTEXT centers around the interaction between co-workers where Co-worker A is offering help to Co-worker B, who has a heavy workload. In this context, understanding the dynamics of their relationship and each person's attitude towards support and teamwork are important. MEMORY 1 discusses Co-worker B's supportive nature and positive work relationship with Co-worker A, which is directly relevant to the context of offering and accepting help. MEMORY 2, however, focuses on personal growth and past struggles of Co-worker A, which, while insightful about their background, does not directly inform the current context of workload and help.\n\nChoice: 1"
