    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains information about the Mentee’s journey of moving to a new city and their broader aspirations surrounding gender equality. This context about the Mentee's move and aspirations can be useful for the Mentor to encourage and relate the current situation of making new friends to their larger life goals and past experiences.
