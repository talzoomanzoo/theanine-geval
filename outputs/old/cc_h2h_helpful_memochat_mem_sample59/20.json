    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 offers more relevant information to the current playful and friendly dialogue context. It portrays the friendly and good-natured dynamic between Neighbors A and B, further validated by memories of shared activities, like planning to spend more time together or considering another leisure activity, such as a movie night. This suggests that they share a rapport that plays into the fun and teasing tone of the present conversation. MEMORY 1, although demonstrating their friendship, focuses on practical and considerate aspects when dealing with chores, which is less relevant to the current light-hearted and teasing exchange.\n\nChoice: 2"
