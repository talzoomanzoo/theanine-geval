Everyone makes mistakes. We'll get through this together. ### Parent: That means a lot to me, son. Thank you. ### Parent: I remember waking up early one morning while I was in juvenile detention. I couldn't see the sunrise from my cell, but I still felt hopeful that things would get better. ### Child: That must have been tough, not having the freedom to just go outside and watch the sunrise. ### Parent: It was. But I learned to appreciate the small moments and find hope even in the darkest of situations. ### Child: That's really inspiring, Parent. Did you ever get to see the sunrise when you got out of detention? ### Parent: I did. One morning, I woke up early and went outside to watch the sunrise. It was a reminder to me that there is always a new day and a chance to start fresh. ### Child: That's so beautiful.
