A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\n\nMEMORY 1\nCo-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\nCo-worker A spoke with the police about the incident and the women involved were thankful.\n\nMEMORY 2\nRelated Evidences: ``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else.

    "prediction": "Explanation: \nMemory 1 provides some context about Co-worker A's behaviours and interactions by mentioning a past scenario where Co-worker A borrowed something without asking and also involved in a police issue where women were thankful. However, the information seems unrelated to the situation presented in the Dialogue Context regarding Co-worker A's plan to steal the bride. Memory 2 lacks specific details or context but might relate more closely to the stated plan as it could potentially provide related discussions or evidences linked to this specific plan.\n\nChoice: 2"
