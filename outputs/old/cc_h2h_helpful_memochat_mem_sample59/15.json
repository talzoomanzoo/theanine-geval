    "prediction": "Explanation: None of the memories seem directly relevant to the current conversation about feeling lonely in a new city and making new connections. Both memories focus more on other topics (e.g., college application stress), which are not directly related to the dialog context. However, Memory 1 seems to provide a bit more general emotional support with phrases like \"reassures Mentee\" and \"gratitude for the Mentor's guidance,\" which could be slightly more applicable to extending support in Lonely situations even though it's tied to a different context.\n\nChoice: 1"
