It seems like there's always one more thing I need to do or study for. ### Mentor: It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed, Mentee. Applying to colleges can be a stressful experience. But remember, you're not alone in this. Many students are feeling the same way. ### Mentee: I know, but it feels like everyone else has everything together. They have their applications submitted and their essays already written. ### Mentor: Don't compare yourself to others, Mentee. Everyone works at their own pace. What matters is that you're putting in the effort and taking the steps necessary to reach your goals. ### Mentee: That's true. But I feel like I'm running out of time. The SAT is next month and I don't feel ready. ### Mentor: Have you been studying consistently? ### Mentee: Yes, but it feels like there's so much material to cover. ### Mentor: Remember to break it down into manageable chunks. Schedule study sessions and breaks to prevent burnout. And don't forget to utilize resources like practice exams and review books. ### Mentee: Thanks, Mentor. I appreciate your advice. ### Mentor: Of course, Mentee. And always remember to take care of yourself.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 discusses the Mentor's long-term guidance and support for the Mentee in work and college applications, but it also mentions unrelated, serious issues about theft. MEMORY 2, while focusing on college application stress, contains dialogue that highlights assurance, guidance, and empathy similar to the current dialogue context, which is about feeling lonely and the challenges of meeting new people. Given the current discussion's focus on the Mentee's struggles with forming connections and adapting to a new environment, MEMORY 2 offers more relevant support strategies, conveying empathy, and understanding.\n\nChoice: 2"
