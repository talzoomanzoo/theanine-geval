I remember when we talked about how warm it was in the house a few years ago. It definitely feels hotter outside today. ### Neighbors B: Yeah, I remember that conversation. We should probably make sure to have some extra water on hand for the next time you mow the lawn. ### Neighbors A: That would be great. Maybe next time we can both work on it together and make it a little easier. ### Neighbors B: Sounds good to me. I always enjoy spending time outside, even if it's just doing chores like mowing the lawn. ### Neighbors A: Me too. And who knows, maybe we'll discover even more things we have in common.
