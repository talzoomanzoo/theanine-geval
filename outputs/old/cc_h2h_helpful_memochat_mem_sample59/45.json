    "prediction": "Explanation: \nIn MEMORY 1, there is additional context about Co-worker A's commendable qualities and past actions, such as intervening in a fight and having a resilient attitude despite personal challenges. This provides a richer backstory that might influence how Co-worker B approaches guiding Co-worker A in the current situation. However, while MEMORY 1 provides a broader portrayal of Co-worker A's character and actions, MEMORY 2 focuses explicitly on the specific incident related to feeling guilty about borrowing a pencil. \n\nGiven the current dialogue context where Co-worker A equates their feelings of guilt in the romantic situation to borrowing a pencil, MEMORY 2 provides a clearer and more succinct reference to this incident that may directly inform how Co-worker B addresses Co-worker A's feelings of guilt and compulsion in the present context. \n\nChoice: 2"
