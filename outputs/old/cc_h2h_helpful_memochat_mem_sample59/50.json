    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 provides more context related to co-worker interactions and their supportive relationship, which directly relates to the current conversation about workload and offering help. It highlights co-worker B's supportive nature and their past exchanges of help, which align with the dialogue context where Co-worker A is offering help. Memory 2, while it touches on personal growth and struggles, does not closely align with the immediate conversation about managing workload and offering assistance.\n\nChoice: 1"
