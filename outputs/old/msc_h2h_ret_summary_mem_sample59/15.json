    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: No, I've never been to the Caribbean, but it sounds like a fantastic place to visit. I'm looking forward to learning how to swim and programming with your guidance.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: No, I've never been to the Caribbean but it sounds amazing! I can't wait to hear all about your snorkeling adventures when you get back.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response explicitly reflects any past memories, as there are no past memories provided in the prompt. However, based on the current conversation, Response 2 slightly hints at a potential new memory that might be created from Speaker A's snorkeling adventures that relate to the Caribbean trip mentioned. Response 1 focuses more on the immediate meetup activities and learning experiences, which aligns with the current conversation but doesn't tie back to any explicit past memory or potential shared future experiences like in Response 2.\n\nChoice: 2"
