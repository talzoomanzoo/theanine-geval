    "prediction": "Explanation: The current conversation is specifically about planning a trip to Sweden. Response 1 directly addresses the trip by discussing progress on flights and accommodations. Response 2, on the other hand, shifts to a different topic (karate) which is unrelated to the trip or any previously mentioned past memories. Therefore, Response 1 has higher Memorability as it stays on topic and reflects on the task of planning the Sweden trip.\n\nChoice: 1"
