Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\nSpeaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing?  \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: He's doing well, thank you for asking. He's getting ready for his birthday, and he's excited to finally be a teenager.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: He's doing great, thanks for asking! He's about to turn 14, can you believe it? Time really does fly. I need to start planning his birthday party soon. By the way, I haven't started packing yet for my trip. I should probably get on that soon, lol.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses incorporate the mention of Speaker A's inquiry about Speaker B's nephew, but Response 2 provides more memorable details by mentioning the nephew's upcoming age of 14 and the idea of planning a birthday party. It also briefly loops back to Speaker B's trip to Costa Rica, which has been a part of their ongoing conversation. This reflection of past memories related to the trip gives it a slight edge in terms of memorability.\n\nChoice: 2"
