    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: Definitely, I'd be curious to try it! It would be interesting to see if there's any difference in taste.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: Sure thing! It's called Mediterranean Stuffed Bell Peppers. I think you'll love it with your taste for Mediterranean food. Looking forward to sending you that pic!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither of the responses directly references any past memories or specific experiences mentioned previously in the conversation. Thus, neither response effectively demonstrates memorability based on the given criterion. Response 1 relates directly to the discussion about cloned cows and the potential for a hamburger from a cloned cow, which aligns with the immediate conversation and shows some continuity. However, Response 2 introduces a completely unrelated topic about Mediterranean Stuffed Bell Peppers, which does not connect at all to the current conversation or any past memories provided.\n\nChoice: 1"
