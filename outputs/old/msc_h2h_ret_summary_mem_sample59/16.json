    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I'll definitely let you know how it goes. It's going to be a fantastic experience for sure.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: I'll definitely keep you posted on how the trip goes. It would be awesome to have you on one of my future cruises. Let's make it happen!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither of the responses explicitly brings up any specific past memory. However, Response 2 refers back to the idea of Speaker B joining Speaker A on a future cruise, which is a concept introduced earlier in the conversation (Speaker B mentioned going on one of Speaker A's cruises). Therefore, Response 2 shows a tangible reflection of the conversation and this part stands out slightly more as memorable than simply discussing the speaker's future trip as in Response 1. \n\nChoice: 2"
