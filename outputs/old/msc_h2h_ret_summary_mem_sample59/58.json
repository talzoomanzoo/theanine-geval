    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\nSpeaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk?\nSpeaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous.\nSpeaker B: That sounds amazing! Did you bring a pet? I love doing the harder trails with my dog. Sometimes, it's very peaceful to get away from everything. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I didn't bring a pet this time, but I can imagine how peaceful it must be to have a furry companion on the trail with you.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: I prefer camping in a tent for the authentic outdoor experience. Have you ever considered bringing your kitten along on your camping trips?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response directly calls back to any past memories, as there is no specific past memory provided in the prompt relating to pets, nature walks, or camping. However, given the current conversation, Response 1 shows empathetic engagement with Speaker B's mention of bringing a pet and enjoying harder trails with a dog, which aligns with the existing conversational context. Conversely, Response 2 introduces a new topic that diverges from the established dialogue about nature walks, trails, and pets.\n\nChoice: 1"
