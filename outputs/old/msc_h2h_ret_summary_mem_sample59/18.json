    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\nSpeaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car?\nSpeaker B: Yes, there are several. Hope we could meet and You possibly teach me about computer programming. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: That sounds like a plan! I can definitely help you with computer programming as well during our meetup this weekend.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: That sounds like a plan! I'll make sure to include some programming lessons during our cruise trip. Looking forward to it!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 reflects past memories accurately by connecting the meetup this weekend, which is already established in the conversation as an opportunity for teaching computer programming. Speaker A mentions specifically \"during our meetup this weekend,\" linking directly to prior conversation points where the meetup and programming were discussed. \n\nResponse 2, however, incorrectly suggests including programming lessons during a future cruise trip. While the cruise was mentioned earlier, the past conversation did not establish that the cruise would be an occasion for programming lessons.\n\nChoice: 1"
