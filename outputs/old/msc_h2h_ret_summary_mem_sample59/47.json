    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?   \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I've never done therapy, but I can see how it could be beneficial. What made you decide to start your own practice?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: Thank you, that means a lot! My parents are supportive, but they just want me to do what makes me happy. I'm sure your parents feel the same way about your decision to pursue teaching. It's important to follow your passion.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response directly recalls any past memories from previous conversations or information specific to Speaker A's background. Response 1 focuses on the topic of therapy and asks a relevant follow-up question about Speaker B's career decision, while Response 2 introduces new information about Speaker A's parents and mistakenly mentions teaching, which was not previously discussed, indicating a lack of relevance to the current discussion and retention of past conversational details. Since past memories are not being drawn upon in either response, Response 1 is chosen as it stays on the topic of therapy and involves the current discussion more directly.\n\nChoice: 1"
