Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I'll be in Costa Rica for about a week. I can't wait to explore the rainforests and beaches!\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: I'm planning to stay for about a week. I want to make the most out of the Easter weekend and spring break. Lol, I'm excited to drive my new car there!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses mention the duration of the trip, which aligns with Speaker A's question. However, Response 1 is more focused on Costa Rica, mentioning specific activities that align with the nature of the destination, which makes it relevant and memorable in the context of the conversation. Response 2, on the other hand, introduces the unrelated topic of driving a new car, which may not be relevant given the mode of transportation to Costa Rica is generally by plane. Therefore, Response 1 is more memorable because it maintains focus on Costa Rica and the anticipated experiences there. \n\nChoice: 1"
