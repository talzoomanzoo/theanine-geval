    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\nSpeaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I enjoy cruising to nearby cities like Savannah or Charleston. They have charming vibes.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: I've always wanted to visit New Orleans. The music scene there seems amazing.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: There is no explicit past memory provided in the conversation, so we assess the responses based on how well they follow and relate to Speaker A's question. Speaker A asks Speaker B about cities they like visiting while cruising in their car. Response 1 directly answers the question by mentioning specific nearby cities, Savannah and Charleston, which aligns with the context of nearby car travel. Response 2, while interesting, mentions New Orleans, which is not necessarily a nearby city and introduces a slightly different topic about the music scene, which wasn't the focus of the question. Therefore, Response 1 has better memorability as it recalls and applies the immediate prior context more accurately.\n\nChoice: 1"
