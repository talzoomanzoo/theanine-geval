    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\nSpeaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I visited a local nature reserve with some beautiful trails.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: I'm glad your daughter had a great time! I haven't done much camping, but I do enjoy spending time outdoors.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nIn the current conversation, Speaker B asks where Speaker A went on their walk. Response 1 directly answers this question by mentioning a local nature reserve with beautiful trails, which is relevant to the immediate context of the conversation. However, no past memories are referenced in either response. Response 2 mentions Speaker B's daughter and references camping and enjoying the outdoors, which might imply some past shared experiences (as B's daughter is mentioned), but without any specific past memory directly provided, it seems more like an assumption than a reference to a concrete past memory. Since neither response reflects past memories given, the focus should be on the relevance and connection to the conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
