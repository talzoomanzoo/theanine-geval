    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I agree, it's hard to know for sure where our food comes from. I'll keep working hard in the lab and school.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: That sounds amazing! Chicken parmesan is one of my favorites too. I bet it tastes even better because it's free. Can't wait to see the pic!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The task is to choose a response with better memorability, which means reflecting on past conversations or shared experiences between the speakers. In this case, we don't have explicit past memories provided. We can only evaluate the responses based on the current conversation context. Speaker A discussed food origins, cloning, and encouraged Speaker B to not quit if classes get hard. Among the given responses, Response 1 follows the thread of the conversation by acknowledging the difficulty of knowing food sources and expressing determination to continue efforts in both lab and school. Response 2 introduces an unrelated topic of chicken parmesan, showing no connection to the current conversation's flow.\n\nChoice: 1"
