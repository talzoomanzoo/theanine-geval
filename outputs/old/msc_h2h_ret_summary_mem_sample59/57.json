    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\nSpeaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk?\nSpeaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: The river trail sounds lovely. I always enjoy being near the water.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: One of our favorite camping spots is by the lake. It's so peaceful and relaxing. Have you ever gone camping by the water?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response specifically recalls shared or individual past memories to enhance the memorability of the conversation. Response 1 acknowledges the description of the river and affirms an enjoyment of water-based experiences in general, which aligns with the conversation but doesn't add past context. Response 2 introduces a new memory about camping by a lake but doesn't directly connect to Speaker A's previous experiences or memories shared in the current conversation, as no historical context about camping or lakes is given.\n\nChoice: tie"
