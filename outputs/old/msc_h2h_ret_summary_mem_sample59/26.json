    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I totally get what you mean. It's always good to be informed about what we're eating. Would you be up for trying a plant-based burger together sometime?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: I would go for the tres leches cake with fresh raspberry jam sauce and lemon drizzle. It sounds like the perfect combination of sweet and tangy flavors. Enjoy your meal!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 ties directly back to the discussion about plant-based burgers, maintaining continuity and relevance to what Speaker A and Speaker B have recently been talking about. It reflects Speaker A's mention of being open to trying a plant-based burger and builds on that memory by suggesting they try it together, thus enhancing memorability by directly reflecting the recent interaction. \n\nResponse 2, on the other hand, completely deviates from the previous conversation about cloned and plant-based burgers. It introduces a new and unrelated topic about a specific dessert, which does not connect to any past memories or the current conversation. This lack of relevance and connection to prior discussion makes it less memorable in the context of the conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
