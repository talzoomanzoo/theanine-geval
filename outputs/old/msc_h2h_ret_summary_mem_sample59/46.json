    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I do still enjoy being a therapist, but it definitely has its challenges. It's rewarding to help people navigate through their struggles.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: Thank you, I appreciate your support! Teaching robotics seems like a fascinating field to get into. I hope you achieve your goal as well.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: None of the responses reflect on any specific past memories shared between the speakers, as no past memories were provided in the context. However, Response 1 continues the conversation about Speaker B's experience and feelings about being a therapist, maintaining coherence and relevance. Response 2, on the other hand, introduces an element of teaching robotics and a goal that wasn't mentioned, making it less relevant and memorable in the context of the current conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
