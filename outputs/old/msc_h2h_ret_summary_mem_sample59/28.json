    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal.\nSpeaker B: That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab!\nSpeaker A: Oh! I did not know that. Well if you can clone cows that's more ice cream for you! Haha. What's your favorite ice cream flavor? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I love mint chocolate chip ice cream! It's so refreshing and has just the right amount of sweetness. What about you, what's your favorite flavor?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: Yes, I had it with fresh strawberries on top. It added a nice touch of sweetness to the creamy cake. You'll love it!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response recalls any past memory from the conversation, nor do they reference past events or topics mentioned earlier. However, Response 1 builds on the ice cream topic initiated by Speaker A with a specific favorite flavor, while Response 2 seems unrelated and introduces a different subject about having dessert with strawberries, which does not relate to previous portions of the conversation. Both responses do not increase Memorability as they do not refer back to past memories, but Response 1 maintains topic continuity. Memorability is not affected by past memories specifically, so they are equal on this criterion.\n\nChoice: tie"
