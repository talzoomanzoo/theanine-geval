    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I've always been interested in helping others and psychology, so becoming a therapist felt like a natural fit for me.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: I have spoken to my advisor, and teaching does seem like a promising path. I just worry about the limited job opportunities in linguistics compared to other fields.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: In the given responses, Response 1 directly addresses the question about becoming a therapist by discussing an interest in helping others and psychology, making it more relevant and reflective of the past decision to become a therapist. There is no recalled past memory specifically mentioned in the conversation or responses to connect with, so the response that stays on topic and addresses the context more clearly is the better choice based on the criterion of Memorability. Response 2, on the other hand, discusses concerns about job opportunities related to teaching and linguistics, which is unrelated to the question about deciding to become a therapist and doesn't mention past memories relevant to the decision of becoming a therapist.\n\nChoice: 1"
