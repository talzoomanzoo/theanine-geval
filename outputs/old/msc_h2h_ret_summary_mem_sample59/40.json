    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden?\nSpeaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends.\nSpeaker A: That sounds nice! So how is your job going?\nSpeaker B: Always interesting, that's for sure! I have been training to nurse on a new floor, so that'll give me a change of scenery. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: That's exciting! A change of scenery can be refreshing.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: That sounds like a fantastic plan! I'd love to check out the pool and see you in action. As for lunch, how about we go to that new sushi place downtown?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses from Speaker A do not recall any past memories explicitly, leaving memorability low. However, Response 2 includes an invitation to have lunch at a sushi place and to visit Speaker B's workplace, which might imply shared experiences or plans based on previous shared memories. It suggests a more involved relationship, which slightly elevates its memorability factor—although Speaker B’s job or their past encounters at the workplace or eating sushi were not mentioned earlier in the conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
