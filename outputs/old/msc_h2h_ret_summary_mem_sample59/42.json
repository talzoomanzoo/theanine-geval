    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden?\nSpeaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends.\nSpeaker A: That sounds nice! So how is your job going?\nSpeaker B: Always interesting, that's for sure! I have been training to nurse on a new floor, so that'll give me a change of scenery.\nSpeaker A: Does that add a lot of extra work to your plate?\nSpeaker B: At the moment, yes. I'll be in Pediatrics, which has always been my passion. It's a completely different environment than the ER. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: That's great that you'll be working in Pediatrics, I'm sure it will be a rewarding experience for you.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: The new deli it is! I can't wait to try it out. I'll see you at the pool this weekend too, it will be fun!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 1 addresses Speaker B's new position in Pediatrics and ties back to the previous discussion about their job. It acknowledges Speaker B's passion for Pediatrics, showing memorability by reflecting on the past memory shared in the conversation. Response 2, however, introduces unrelated topics—a new deli and a pool meeting—that were not mentioned in the current conversation, thus lacking memorability and relevance to the discussed topics.\n\nChoice: 1"
