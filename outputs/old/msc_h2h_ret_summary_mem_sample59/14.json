    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: That would be awesome! I'll make sure there's some time for swimming and programming on the cruise too.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: That would be awesome! We could have a blast together. Plus, I've signed up for some snorkeling trips, so you can enjoy the music while I explore underwater.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response directly refers to a specific memory from the past to enhance memorability. However, both responses make an effort to incorporate elements from the conversation. Response 1 highlights the theme of programming and swimming, which aligns well with the conversation about activities they plan to do together. Response 2 introduces snorkeling as a new activity, which does not have any ties to the past memories that could enhance memorability. Since neither response includes direct recollection or reference to specific past memories and Response 1 connects better with the current conversation plans, Response 1 is marginally closer to memorability because it reflects the study and swimming activities already mentioned.\n\nChoice: 1"
