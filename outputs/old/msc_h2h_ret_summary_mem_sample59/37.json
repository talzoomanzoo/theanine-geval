    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I'm hoping to visit Sweden again soon, maybe this summer. I miss playing tennis and going to church on Sundays there.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: How about next Saturday morning? I have a class then, so you can get a feel for it and see if it's something you'd like to pursue.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Since there are no past memories provided to be recalled in the current conversation, the memorability criterion focuses on the relevance of the responses to the current conversation. Response 1 directly answers Speaker A's question about Speaker B's plans to return to Sweden, recalling personal experiences about activities enjoyed in Sweden. Response 2 seems out of context and unrelated to the current conversation about planning a trip to Sweden.\n\nChoice: 1"
