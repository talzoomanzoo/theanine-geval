    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: That sounds wonderful! I always find so much inspiration in nature.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: Yes, she had a great time! She loved seeing all the animals, especially the monkeys. She's really starting to assert her independence, so she had a blast exploring the zoo on her own.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither of the responses provided by Speaker B reflects any recalled past memory from the provided context. Response 1 acknowledges the nature walk but doesn't mention any specific memory. Response 2 oddly talks about someone else (a \"she\") having a great time at a zoo, mentioning animals and independence, but there's no prior context or memory provided to define who \"she\" is or why it is relevant to the earlier conversation about a nature walk.\n\nChoice: tie"
