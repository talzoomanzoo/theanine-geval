Without any specific past memories, consistency is determined by the logical continuation of the conversation. Response 1 maintains the focus on the current issue without introducing any new or inconsistent information. Response 2 involves statements made by \"Unknown,\" which could imply a misunderstanding of who is speaking, and it includes details about homemade pizzas and dinner parties that are not part of the current conversation, thus potentially introducing inconsistency.\n\nChoice: 1"
