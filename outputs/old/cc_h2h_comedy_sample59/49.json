    "prediction": "Explanation: The criterion is consistency with past memories. Without any past memories provided, we should focus on the consistency within the current conversation. Response 1 is consistent as Co-worker A offers help to Co-worker B, aligning with B's admission of a heavy workload. Response 2 introduces an unknown party and breaks the conversation consistency by implying a reciprocal offer of help not present in the current dialogue. \n\nChoice: 1"
