I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it.\nCo-workers B: That's not the same thing, Co-workers A.

I just don't know how to get over this feeling.\nCo-workers B: Maybe try talking to someone about it. A therapist or a trusted friend. They can help you work through these emotions in a healthy way. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers A: You're right, Co-worker B. I'll consider seeking help to work through this.

They can help you work through these feelings and find a better way to cope. Remember, I'm here for you too. Let's work through this together.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
