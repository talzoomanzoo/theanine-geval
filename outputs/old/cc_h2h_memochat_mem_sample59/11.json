    "prediction": "Explanation: Since there are no past memories provided, we can't assess the direct reflection of past memories in the responses. Therefore, memory referencing is not applicable in this scenario.

Each response's merit is purely based on its empathy and advice rather than recalling any past interactions or shared memories.\n\nChoice: tie"
