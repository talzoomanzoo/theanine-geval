Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today?\nCo-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing.\nCo-workers A: Do you need any help? I don't want you to get overwhelmed.\nCo-workers B: That's really nice of you, but I don't want to burden you with my work.\nCo-workers A: It's not a burden if it's something I can do to support you.

Additionally, Co-worker B is impressed with Co-worker A's well-thought-out plans for their partnership. \nCo-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A, resulting in Co-worker A being grateful for the assistance.

    "prediction": "As there are no past memories provided in this scenario, we can only evaluate the given responses based on the current conversation. \n\nResponse 1 reflects on the current dynamic of the conversation and highlights the mutual support and teamwork between the co-workers. It captures the sentiment of taking care of each other that has been established in the prior dialogue, which makes it memorable in the context of the conversation. \n\nResponse 2, however, introduces an unknown speaker and expands on the idea of teamwork conceptually without directly connecting to the specific interaction between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, making it less personal and not directly reflective of the immediate past conversation.\n\nBased on the criterion of memorability and the available conversation, Response 1 is more memorable because it directly ties to the immediate exchange and highlights the relationship established within this interaction and their past interactions as teammates.\n\nChoice: 1"
