Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends.\nMentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\nMentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nMentor: It's completely normal to feel that way, Mentee. Building new friendships takes time, but I believe you'll find your place soon. Just keep being yourself and open to new experiences.\nRESPONSE 2\nUnknown: It's completely understandable to feel that way, Mentee. Starting over in a new city can be challenging, but remember that many others have felt the same at some point. It's an opportunity to step out of your comfort zone and make new connections. Perhaps try joining clubs or social events to meet like-minded individuals. Building new friendships takes time, so be patient and kind to yourself during this transition period.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",

    "memory_text": "1. The Mentor has been guiding and supporting the Mentee in their work for years, which causes the Mentee to be offered a job and decide to take the job in the city.\n2. The Mentee hopes to inspire others to join the cause of gender equality and fighting discrimination, so the Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process, even though the Mentee is feeling overwhelmed with the college application process.",

    "prediction": "My apologies, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the task. Let me try that again.\n\nGiven that there are no past memories provided to recall specific events or conversations, the criterion of memorability based on past memories cannot be directly applied. Instead, the conversation should focus on general advice and encouragement relevant to the experience of being in a new city.\n\nREWRITE:\n\nExplanation: Neither response directly reflects past memories because no specific past memories were provided to be recalled. Both responses offer encouragement and advice on handling the feelings of loneliness and making new connections. In terms of overall support, Response 2 goes further in offering practical suggestions, such as joining clubs or social events, which might resonate more with someone adapting to a new environment. However, the memorability criterion cannot be strictly met without specific past experiences to reference.\n\nChoice: Tie"
