I don't want you to get overwhelmed.\nCo-workers B: That's really nice of you, but I don't want to burden you with my work.\nCo-workers A: It's not a burden if it's something I can do to support you.

    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses reflect the theme of teamwork and support from the conversation, but Response 1 is directly tied to the original exchange between the co-workers, reinforcing the idea that they're a team handling work tasks together. Response 2 introduces an \"Unknown\" speaker and diverges from the conversation by abstracting the idea of support to a more general partnership context, including future business endeavors, which were not part of the original conversation. Thus, it doesn't reflect the specific memory of the team dynamic mentioned earlier as effectively as Response 1 does.\n\nChoice: 1"
