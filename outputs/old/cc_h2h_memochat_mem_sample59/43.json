Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers A: I understand what you're saying, Co-worker B, but I can't help how I feel. Love can make us do crazy things sometimes.\nRESPONSE 2\nUnknown: Co-workers A, it's important to remember that love involves respecting someone's choices and feelings. Kidnapping or forcing someone to be with you is not a healthy or loving action. It's essential to communicate openly and respectfully about your feelings rather than resorting to drastic measures. Let's find a better way to handle this situation that respects the other person's autonomy and feelings.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",

    "prediction": "Explanation: The task requires an evaluation based on memorability through the reflection of past memories mentioned in the conversation. In the given scenario, neither of the responses recalls any past memories, as there were no past memories provided in the scenario. The decision then boils down to which response better reflects upon past conversations. Response 2 has a slight edge because it reflects the previous statements about respecting feelings and choices more comprehensively. However, both options are quite similar in repeating themes from earlier dialogue.\n\nChoice: tie"
