Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it.\nCo-workers B: That's not the same thing, Co-workers A. Stealing someone and keeping them against their will is illegal and immoral. You need to let go of this obsession and move on.\nCo-workers A: I know you're right, Co-workers B. I just don't know how to get over this feeling. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers B: It's understandable that you're struggling, Co-worker A. Have you considered talking to someone or seeking professional help to work through these emotions?\nRESPONSE 2\nUnknown: It's important to acknowledge your feelings, Co-worker A, but it's crucial to understand the difference between guilt over a small act like borrowing a pencil and the serious consequences of actions like kidnapping. Seek support and professional help to work through your emotions and find healthier ways to cope.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
