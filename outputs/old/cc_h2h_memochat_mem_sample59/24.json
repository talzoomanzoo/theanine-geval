Lighten up a bit.\nNeighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water.\nNeighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nNeighbors B: I appreciate the apology. Let's move on and enjoy the rest of our time together.\nRESPONSE 2\nUnknown: I understand that you are trying to apologize and move on from the situation.

    "memory_text": "Neighbors A and B, who have known each other for years, plan to hang out once a week, possibly watching a movie, getting coffee, or just talking. They are on friendly terms and enjoy spending time together. Neighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A. They reminisce about past events and cherish their friendship.",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate the apology. Let's move on and enjoy the rest of our time together.",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses address the situation but in different ways. Response 1 directly relates to the conversation by accepting the apology and suggesting to move forward. It demonstrates the ability to reflect on the recent interaction and acknowledge the apology, showing a level of Memorability by being relevant to what has happened. Response 2, on the other hand, brings in a more generalized statement about apologies and relationship rebuilding without directly referencing the past memory shared, thus lacking specific memorability in this context.\n\nChoice: 1"
