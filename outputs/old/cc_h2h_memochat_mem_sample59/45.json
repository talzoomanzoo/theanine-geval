Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it.\nCo-workers B: That's not the same thing, Co-workers A. Stealing someone and keeping them against their will is illegal and immoral. You need to let go of this obsession and move on. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers A: I know you're right, Co-worker B. I'll try to let go of this obsession and respect her choices. Thanks for being honest with me.\nRESPONSE 2\nUnknown: It's important to understand that love should never involve forcing someone against their will. It's crucial to respect the choices and feelings of others. Just like how you felt guilty about borrowing my pencil without asking, it's essential to recognize and correct your actions. Letting go of this obsession and moving on is the best course of action for everyone involved.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",

    "prediction": "Explanation: The conversation includes a memory of Co-workers A borrowing Co-workers B's pencil without asking, which Co-workers A references to explain his feelings and actions. Response 1 is directly from Co-workers A, showing personal reflection and acknowledgment of Co-workers B's advice, which ties back to the past memory of borrowing the pencil. Response 2, on the other hand, generalizes the advice and merely refers to the pencil incident abstractly, not showing the same level of personal reflection or change in perspective shown in Response 1.\n\nChoice: 1"
