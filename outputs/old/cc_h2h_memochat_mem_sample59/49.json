Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today?\nCo-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers A: If you need any help, feel free to let me know.\nRESPONSE 2\nUnknown: Hey, I heard you're managing a heavy workload.

This positive interaction led to Co-worker A having a good job and doing well, despite their difficult upbringing.\n\n2. Co-worker B supported and encouraged Co-worker A to prioritize their health, leading to Co-worker A borrowing a horse from Co-worker B and having a great time riding it. This act of kindness made Co-worker B glad and feeling like the trade worked out well for both of them. Additionally, Co-worker B was impressed by Co-worker A's well-thought-out plans for their partnership.",

Consequently, the focus will be on assessing how well the given responses reference past details contained within the conversation rather than external memories.\n\nExplanation: \nResponse 1 directly references Co-workers B's comment about having a heavy workload by offering assistance, which is a relevant and supportive nod to what was just mentioned. Response 2, on the other hand, introduces new information and advice about health without directly acknowledging Co-workers B or their current context, even though it is supportive advice. \n\nChoice: 1"
