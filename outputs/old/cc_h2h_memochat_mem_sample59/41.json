Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers A: I was just joking, Co-worker B. I would never actually do something like that.\nRESPONSE 2\nUnknown: I understand your concern, Co-worker B. It's important to respect the autonomy and choices of others, including the bride. If there are any concerns or issues, it's best to address them openly and respectfully rather than resorting to drastic actions. Let's find a more appropriate and ethical way to handle the situation.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",

Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\n2. Co-worker B commended Co-worker A for their bravery and willingness to help. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\n3. Co-worker B mentioned helping a customer resolve an issue last week, showing a willingness to assist others. Co-worker A is alive but will need time to adjust to their new way of life.",

    "prediction": "Explanation: \nSince there are no specific past memories provided to recall, we must base the decision solely on the conversation itself. Response 1 reflects Co-worker A acknowledging the joke, which could imply an awareness of a past behavior of making such jokes if that was a repeated behavior. Response 2, however, introduces an unknown speaker and does not tie back to a given past memory or previous interaction, making it less relevant to the current conversation. With no concrete past memories or context provided for the unknown speaker, Response 1, being from the original participant and addressing the content directly, offers better continuity with potential past interactions and tones.\n\nChoice: 1"
