Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Therapy can definitely be helpful in processing past experiences. It's great that you find solace in riding your horses though, there's something special about that bond.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: It's great that you have found therapy in riding your horses, but talking to someone could also be beneficial for addressing any unresolved childhood trauma. Therapy can provide a safe space for exploring and processing these experiences.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",

Both responses are consistent with the current conversation where Speaker A mentions finding therapy in riding horses and considers therapy for unresolved childhood trauma. Both responses acknowledge the solace found in riding horses and suggest the benefits of talking to someone.\n\nChoice: tie"
