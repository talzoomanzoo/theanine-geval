    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I agree, it's hard to know for sure where our food comes from. I'll keep working hard in the lab and school.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: It's great to encourage Speaker B to not quit if classes get tough. Your point about the source of beef is interesting and raises questions about food transparency in the future.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "As there are no past memories provided, we focus on the conversation. The relevant points from the conversation are: Speaker B's desire to work in the lab unless classes become too hard, and the topic of cloned cow beef. Response 1 directly acknowledges these points without introducing new or contradictory information. Response 2 introduces a somewhat odd phrasing referring to themselves in third-person (\"Speaker B\"), which may be seen as inconsistent within the conversation's context, but does not introduce contradictory content otherwise.\n\nHowever, at the strictly textual level of consistency, Response 2 is more of a stylized rephrasing rather than actual inconsistency.\n\nExplanation: Both responses maintain consistency with the given conversation; they do not introduce contradictory information, but Response 1 is more directly aligned in continuing Speaker B's expressed sentiments.\nChoice: tie"
