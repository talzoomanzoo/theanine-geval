Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I'm hoping to visit Sweden again soon, maybe this summer. I miss playing tennis and going to church on Sundays there.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: That's great to hear about your progress in planning your trip to Sweden! When you visit, make sure to check out the castles in Visby, as recommended by Speaker B. As for Speaker B's plans to go back to Sweden, you can ask them for more details or share your own experiences about traveling to Sweden.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither of the responses provides specific contradicting information to the current conversation since we have no prior memories to compare against. However, Response 1 suggests Speaker B enjoys specific activities in Sweden (tennis and church), which does not contradict, but rather complements the conversation. Response 2 is unnecessarily meta, referring to Speaker B in the third person and talking about actions the user could take outside of the conversation flow. As there is no explicit contradiction in either response, we focus on fittingness in the conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
