    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: That's really kind of you to offer. I might take you up on that offer, I think it could be beneficial for me.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: It seems like you have found therapy to be helpful and rewarding in your practice. Thank you for offering your services to me, I appreciate it.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Since both response 1 and response 2 do not contain any contradictions to the past conversation, they are both consistent. Response 1 expresses a potential interest in taking up the therapy offer, while response 2 acknowledges and appreciates the offer without directly expressing an intention to proceed with it. Both responses are valid and in alignment with the conversation but given the criterion for consistency and without any past memories to conflict, they are both equally consistent.\n\nChoice: tie"
