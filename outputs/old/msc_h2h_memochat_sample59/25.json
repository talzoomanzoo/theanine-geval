    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I've tried a Beyond Burger before, and I have to admit, it was surprisingly close to the real thing!\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: Based on the previous dialogs and related evidence, it seems like Speaker B is exploring alternative options like Beyond burgers or plant-based versions. Speaker A could respond by sharing their thoughts on trying these alternatives and discussing potential benefits of incorporating them into their diet.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses do not contradict any past memories as none have been provided. The consistency criterion in this case is based on the current conversation alone. Response 1 is a clear answer to Speaker B's question, reflecting on personal experience, and is consistent with the topic being discussed. Response 2 is consistent in terms of the content, but it is more analytical/metatextual rather than being a direct response within the conversation, which makes it less coherent with the dialogue style.\n\nChoice: 1"
