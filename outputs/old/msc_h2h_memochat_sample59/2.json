    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are consistent with the current conversation. Speaker A mentioned never having been to Costa Rica, so response 2 referencing Speaker A's previous travels to Canada and Mexico aligns with the conversation. Response 1 also maintains consistency by describing Speaker B's plans for the trip to Costa Rica, without any contradictory information. The conversation did not establish how long Speaker B is staying, which is information provided in response 1, but this does not contradict any past memory or current conversation, only adds new information.\n\nChoice: tie"
