    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: That would be awesome! I'll make sure there's some time for swimming and programming on the cruise too.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: That sounds like a great idea! We could incorporate some swimming lessons and programming study sessions into our cruise plans. It will be a fun and productive trip!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Without past memories to consider, both responses are equally consistent based on the conversation alone. Both responses acknowledge the idea of a future cruise and mention incorporating swimming and programming, which aligns with the current conversation. As there are no past memories that contradict any of the options, both responses are viable.\n\nChoice: tie"
