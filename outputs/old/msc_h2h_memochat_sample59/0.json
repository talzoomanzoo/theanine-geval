Since there is no further information provided, I would suggest Speaker A to wait for Speaker B's response before continuing the conversation.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 is consistent as it directly addresses the question about purchasing plane tickets and provides a clear reason for not having purchased them yet. Response 2 is not consistent with the conversation as it does not address the question, and instead suggests Speaker A to wait, which is unnecessary since Speaker B is already in the process of responding.\n\nChoice: 1"
