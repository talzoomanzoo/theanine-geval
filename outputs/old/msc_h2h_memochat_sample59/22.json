That's really exciting! \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Definitely! I'm looking forward to seeing how the cloning process unfolds.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: That's exciting to hear about the cloning project with the jersey cow! Are you planning to continue working in the lab during that time?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Since there are no past memories provided, we have no information to evaluate the consistency of either response. Both responses could potentially be consistent with the past, but neither contradicts any specific past memory. Therefore, both responses are equally valid in terms of consistency.\n\nChoice: tie"
