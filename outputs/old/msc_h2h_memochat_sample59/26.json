    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I totally get what you mean. It's always good to be informed about what we're eating. Would you be up for trying a plant-based burger together sometime?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: It's great to have an open mind about trying plant-based options! Understanding more about the cloning process can definitely influence our food choices. What are your thoughts on the ethical considerations of cloning animals for food production?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: There is no past memory data provided, so both responses are assessed solely on the current conversation. Both responses are consistent with the conversation history. Response 1 continues the thread about plant-based burgers, which aligns with Speaker A's expressed willingness to try one. Response 2 acknowledges Speaker A's interest in exploring plant-based options and extends the conversation to ethical considerations, which is a logical progression given the topic's nature. Neither response contradicts the ongoing dialogue.\n\nChoice: tie"
