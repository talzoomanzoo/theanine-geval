It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun! \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: That sounds awesome! I can't wait to listen to it while we hang out by the pool and then get into our programming studies.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: That sounds like a great plan! I'm looking forward to our meetup this weekend for punk rock and pizza burgers.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: There are no past memories provided that would indicate whether having pizza burgers is consistent or not. However, Response 1 stays strictly within the details provided by Speaker A's plan and mentions the activities described: listening by the pool and programming studies. Response 2 introduces new information about eating pizza burgers, which was not mentioned by Speaker A. Without any context from past memories, Response 1 is more consistent with the given conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
