    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Therapy can definitely have a beginning, middle, and end, and it's great to hear about your positive experiences with your horses. Let me know if you ever decide to give therapy a try, I'd be more than happy to help.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: Yes, therapy can have an endpoint when the client successfully completes their journey. It's not something that has to last forever.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nBoth responses are consistent with the current conversation. Speaker B reinforces Speaker A's understanding that therapy can have an endpoint. Response 1 also acknowledges Speaker A's current way of feeling therapeutic benefits by riding horses and extends an offer to help if Speaker A decides to pursue therapy. Response 2 purely focuses on the idea of therapy having an endpoint without additional context or contradictions. Since no past memories were presented, we're relying purely on the consistency within the current conversation.\n\nChoice: tie"
