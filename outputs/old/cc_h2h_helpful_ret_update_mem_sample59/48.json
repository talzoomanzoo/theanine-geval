    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a wider range of relevant information that can help in the context of discussing workload. It includes information about both co-workers' attitudes towards work, the importance Co-worker A places on health and motivation, and the supportive relationship they share. This can inform a more nuanced and supportive response from Co-worker B. MEMORY 1, while also containing helpful information, is more focused on the horse and gratitude around that, which is less directly relevant to the current conversation about workload.\n\nChoice: 2"
