    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should benefit Parent in making a next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit.\n\nMEMORY 1\nNeighbors A and B started spending more time together, eventually becoming good friends who have known each other for years. They catch up frequently, reminiscing about past events and planning to hang out once a week. Neighbors A enjoys the support and comfort Neighbor B provides, while Neighbor B suggests cooking together and shows consideration by offering extra water for lawn mowing.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Neighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A.\n2. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n3. Neighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\n4. Neighbors A and B have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside.\n5. Both Neighbors A and B enjoy spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn.\n6. Neighbor A's mom scolds them for ripping off the tag from their new shirt.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides richer and relevant details about the history and nature of the relationship between Neighbors A and B, which can help understand why Neighbor A thought the action was a joke. It indicates a longstanding friendship built on support and comfort, suggesting that the context of throwing someone into cold water might be seen as lighthearted in a close friendship. \n\nMEMORY 2, while it includes more specific incidents, does not significantly aid in understanding the current dialogue context—it contains more trivial details (e.g., mom scolding about a shirt tag) that do not pertain to the immediacy of their relationship dynamic as experienced in the current interaction.\n\nChoice: 1"
