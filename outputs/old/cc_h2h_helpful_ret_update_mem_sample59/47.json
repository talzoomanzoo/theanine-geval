A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it.\nCo-workers B: That's not the same thing, Co-workers A. Stealing someone and keeping them against their will is illegal and immoral. You need to let go of this obsession and move on.\nCo-workers A: I know you're right, Co-workers B. I just don't know how to get over this feeling.\nCo-workers B: Maybe try talking to someone about it. A therapist or a trusted friend. They can help you work through these emotions in a healthy way.\n\nMEMORY 1\nCo-worker B's willingness to help others was evident when they assisted a customer last week. This trait was further highlighted when Co-worker A borrowed a pencil without asking and felt guilty about it. \nAfter Co-worker A spoke with the police about the incident, the women involved were thankful. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\nReflecting on Co-worker B's past actions, Co-worker A is remembered for their bravery and strength in various situations. Co-worker B admires Co-worker A's resilience and positivity, noting their ability to stay optimistic even in challenging circumstances, such as the accident where they lost their hands and feet.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\n2. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\n3. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's positivity and friendship.\n4. Co-worker B is supportive and willing to help in any way.\n5. Co-worker A is alive but will need time to adjust to their new way of life.\n6. Co-worker A believes in surrounding oneself with positive energy and uplifting people.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 provide some context about Co-worker A borrowing a pencil and feeling guilty about it, as well as Co-worker B's reaction, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT discussing Co-worker A's feelings and actions. However, MEMORY 1 includes additional information about Co-worker A’s past experience talking to the police and Co-worker B's admiration for Co-worker A's resilience. This information may be unnecessary for responding to the immediate conversation and relates less directly to the current ethical dilemma. MEMORY 2 is focused on mutual acknowledgment, positivity, friendship, and support, providing more directly relevant insights into their relationship and dynamic that can be directly helpful in advising Co-worker A further.\n\nChoice: 2"
