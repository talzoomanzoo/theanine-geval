    "prediction": "Explanation: \nMEMORY 2 provides more specific and rich information relevant to Mentee's current situation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. MEMORY 2 offers context about Mentee feeling overwhelmed by both the college application process and the SAT, which might be contributing to their feelings of loneliness and stress. Also, MEMORY 2 highlights previous reassurance given by the Mentor, indicating a similar emotional support scenario, and mentions a pivotal life decision (job in the city) that directly relates to the Mentee's new city experience. This can guide Mentor's response by understanding the underlying causes of loneliness and how the Mentor previously provided support. MEMORY 1, while containing similar points, presents them as more complex scenarios that are less directly tied to the current feelings expressed by the Mentee.\n\nChoice: 2"
