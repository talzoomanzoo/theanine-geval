I don't want you to get overwhelmed.\nCo-workers B: That's really nice of you, but I don't want to burden you with my work.\nCo-workers A: It's not a burden if it's something I can do to support you.

    "prediction": "Explanation: \nMemory 1 primarily focuses on a specific instance where Co-worker B expresses gratitude for a horse given by Co-worker A and supports them in prioritizing health. It lacks comprehensive information about their general working relationship and complementary skills. Memory 2, meanwhile, provides richer context about the collaborative and supportive relationship between the co-workers, detailing occasions of mutual help, team synergy, and shared values. This additional information is more relevant to the current dialogue context about offering and accepting help, making it more beneficial for formulating a supportive response in alignment with the team's dynamic and values.\n\nChoice: 2"
