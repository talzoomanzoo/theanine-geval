A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit.\nNeighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water.\nNeighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it.\n\nMEMORY 1\nNeighbors A and B, who have known each other for years, plan to hang out once a week, possibly watching a movie, getting coffee, or just talking. They are on friendly terms and enjoy spending time together. Neighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A. They reminisce about past events and cherish their friendship.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Neighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A.\n2. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n3. Neighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\n4. Neighbors A and B have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside.\n5. Both Neighbors A and B enjoy spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn.\n6. Neighbor A's mom scolds them for ripping off the tag from their new shirt.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nMemory 1 provides a more focused understanding of the relationship dynamics between Neighbors A and B while presenting less cluttered information specifically about their plans to hang out and the nature of their friendship. It emphasizes the friendly terms on which they are, which can help Parent navigate the current tension in the conversation and possibly, suggest ways to reconcile or repair the minor rift. In contrast, Memory 2, while detailed, includes a lot of unrelated information about daily activities and specific instances that do not directly address the nature of the friendship or their recurrent meetups, which limits its direct applicability to the current dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 1"
