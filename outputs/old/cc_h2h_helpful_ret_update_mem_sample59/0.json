    "prediction": "Explanation: \nMEMORY 1 contains more context and background related to conversation elements such as being a good listener, support, and inspiration. It mentions how the parent and child express love and support, and how this has led the parent to find hope and appreciate small moments, tying in well with the skill of being a good listener. MEMORY 2 offers similar information but in a more fragmented manner and lacks the cohesive storytelling that MEMORY 1 offers, which can be more helpful for the child in creating a meaningful response.\n\nChoice: 1"
