A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\n\nMEMORY 1\nCo-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.

Co-worker B is supportive and willing to help in any way.\n2. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\n3. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\n4. Co-worker A is humble and tries to make the world a better place by helping others.\n5. Co-worker A is alive but will need time to adjust to their new way of life.\n6. Co-worker A believes in surrounding oneself with positive energy and uplifting people.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 focuses on a specific incident involving the pencil borrowing and the incident with the police, which seems unrelated to the dialogue context about a plan to prevent a wedding. MEMORY 2, however, provides more general traits about Co-worker B's supportive nature and Co-worker A's beliefs and character. These aspects could be more relevant to understanding Co-worker A's intentions and personality in their unusual plan to hide the bride, offering more nuanced understanding of their motivations and background.\n\nChoice: 2"
