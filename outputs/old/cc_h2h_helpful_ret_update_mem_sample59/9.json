A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life.\nChild: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you.\nParent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you.\nChild: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you?\nParent: Yeah, it was tough. I felt so alone and scared, and I didn't know if anyone would understand what I was going through. But eventually, I found someone who was willing to listen and it made all the difference.\nChild: I'm glad you found someone to talk to. You know, I remember when we watched the sunrise together a few weeks ago. That was really special.\nParent: It was. I love being able to appreciate the beauty of nature. And you know, having my own place to live in the suburbs makes it even easier to do things like that.\nChild: Yeah, your house is really nice. You've always been good at taking care of yourself.\nParent: Well, I've always valued my independence. Even as a kid, I wanted to do things on my own. That's why I decided to live on my own a few years ago.\nChild: I can see why you would want to do that. You're just really good at being self-sufficient.\n\nMEMORY 1\n1. The child's help and reassurance make the parent want to provide a safe and stable environment for the child, as the parent values independence and self-sufficiency.\n2. The child finds the parent's story inspiring, leading to the child being supportive and proud of their parent for making changes, and willing to help out if needed.\n3. Both the parent and child expressing love and support for each other causes the parent to find hope and appreciate small moments even in difficult situations, mentioning making mistakes in the past and trying to turn their life around.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations.\n2. The parent values independence and self-sufficiency.\n3. The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring.\n4. The parent now lives in a little house in the suburbs that they love.\n5. Both the parent and child enjoy spending time together in their new home.\n6. The parent wants to provide a safe and stable environment for the child.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, the conversation emphasizes the importance of listening, the parent's past experience in detention, appreciating small moments like watching the sunrise, and the value placed on independence and self-sufficiency. Both memories touch on these themes but MEMORY 1 gives richer context about the motivations and emotions of the parent and child. It mentions the parent's desire to provide a stable environment and the child's support and pride in the parent, which directly ties into the current conversation about independence and appreciation of small moments.\n\nChoice: 1"
