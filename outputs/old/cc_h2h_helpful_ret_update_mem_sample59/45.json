A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it.\nCo-workers B: That's not the same thing, Co-workers A. Stealing someone and keeping them against their will is illegal and immoral. You need to let go of this obsession and move on.\n\nMEMORY 1\n- Co-worker A felt guilty about borrowing a pencil from Co-worker B without asking, similar to how they intervened to separate two women in a fight.\n- Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that intervening in the fight was not a big deal and suggested making it up by buying coffee next time, showing their supportive nature.\n- Co-worker A's bravery and willingness to help were commended by Co-worker B, who admires their resilience and positivity, even in challenging situations like the accident where they lost their hands and feet.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\n2. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\n3. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's positivity and friendship.\n4. Co-worker B is supportive and willing to help in any way.\n5. Co-worker A is alive but will need time to adjust to their new way of life.\n6. Co-worker A intervened to help two women who were fighting, showing bravery and a desire to make a positive impact.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nIn the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, Co-worker A expresses an intention to 'steal' the bride out of an obsessive love, comparing it with borrowing a pencil without permission. The dialogues focus on notions of guilt, moral boundaries, and understanding the difference between minor transgressions and serious wrongdoing. MEMORY 1 provides a deeper context to understanding Co-worker A's character by adding the dimension of Co-worker A intervening in a fight, potentially connecting this to a pattern of behavior where Co-worker A crosses boundaries, initially seen in the pencil borrowing incident. It also highlights a past accident that affected Co-worker A significantly, which could be contributing to their current emotional state. Meanwhile, MEMORY 2 offers a more general background without connecting these nuances specifically to the dialogue context, although it does mention bravery in helping two women, which could be linked to moral boundaries.\n\nChoice: 1"
