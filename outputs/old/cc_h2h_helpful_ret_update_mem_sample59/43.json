I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\n\nMEMORY 1\n1. Co-worker B commended Co-worker A for their bravery and willingness to help, showing support and willingness to assist in any situation. This led to Co-worker A feeling grateful and appreciative of Co-worker B's help.\n2. Co-worker A witnessed a fight and intervened to separate the two women, displaying bravery and strength. This act of courage is remembered by others, including Co-worker B, who admires Co-worker A's resilience and positivity. Co-worker B also appreciates Co-worker A's positive energy and friendship.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\n2.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 primarily focuses on Co-worker A's act of bravery and Co-worker B's admiration and support, which may not be directly relevant to the current dialogue context. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 provides a bit more specific information about Co-worker B's supportive nature and willingness to help, which ties into the dialogue where Co-worker B is attempting to guide Co-worker A about the appropriate way to express love and respect choices. Additionally, MEMORY 2 includes more detailed interactions between the co-workers that reflect on their relationship dynamics.\n\nChoice: 2"
