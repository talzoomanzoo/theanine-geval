A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it.\nCo-workers B: That's not the same thing, Co-workers A. Stealing someone and keeping them against their will is illegal and immoral. You need to let go of this obsession and move on.\nCo-workers A: I know you're right, Co-workers B. I just don't know how to get over this feeling.\n\nMEMORY 1\nCo-worker B showed a willingness to assist others by helping a customer resolve an issue last week, which reflects their supportive nature. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it, similar to the feeling of guilt when Co-worker A spoke with the police about an incident. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and suggested making it up by buying coffee next time, showing their supportive and understanding nature. Co-worker B commended Co-worker A for their bravery and willingness to help, which inspired Co-worker A to stay positive and focus on their recovery as a daunting task. Co-worker B's admiration for Co-worker A's resilience and positivity is appreciated, highlighting the bond of friendship between them.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1.
