    "prediction": "The task is to explain which MEMORY is more helpful based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT provided, especially focusing on the resolution of the cold water prank and the cooling down of the situation. MEMORY 1 contains information about the planned activities and the nature of relationship between the Neighbors A and B which aligns with the dialogue context of them enjoying spending time together and resolving misunderstandings. MEMORY 2, while indicating an interest in outdoor activities and a supportive relationship, does not directly relate to the specific resolution of the incident or plan for future hangouts that MEMORY 1 addressed. Therefore, MEMORY 1 is more helpful for Parent in crafting a response in the current context because it directly pertains to coordinating activities and forwarding the amicable tone of the dialogue after the resolution of the incident.\n\nExplanation: MEMORY 1 directly references plans for hanging out and resolves the situation amicably which is what the dialogue context is aiming towards after the cold water incident gets resolved.\nChoice: 1"
