A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today?\nCo-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing.\n\nMEMORY 1\n1. Co-worker B offered help and support to Co-worker A, which made Co-worker B feel supportive and glad that Co-worker A is okay. This positive interaction led to Co-worker A having a good job and doing well, despite their difficult upbringing.\n\n2. Co-worker B supported and encouraged Co-worker A to prioritize their health, leading to Co-worker A borrowing a horse from Co-worker B and having a great time riding it. This act of kindness made Co-worker B glad and feeling like the trade worked out well for both of them. Additionally, Co-worker B was impressed by Co-worker A's well-thought-out plans for their partnership.\n\nMEMORY 2\n1. Co-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to prioritize their health.\n2. Co-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A.\n3. Co-worker A feels motivated about the future and is excited to work with Co-worker B.\n4. Co-worker A values their health to continue working at their best.\n5. Co-workers A and B have a positive and optimistic attitude towards their future collaboration.\n6. Co-worker B is impressed with Co-worker A's well-thought-out plans for their partnership.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 offers multiple points of detail that are directly relevant to the relationship between co-workers A and B, including the attitudes, motivations, and collaborative goals. These details can help guide Co-worker A in offering a corresponding response or action, particularly in terms of support, health prioritization, or shared future plans. On the other hand, MEMORY 1 provides multiple separate examples, but some details (such as borrowing a horse) seem less likely to come into play in the discussed context and could be less helpful for immediate dialogue considerations.\n\nChoice: 2"
