Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today?\nCo-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing.\nCo-workers A: Do you need any help?

    "prediction": "Explanation: \nNeither response directly reflects past memories, as no past memories were provided in the input. However, the first response maintains the continuity of the conversation and aligns with the context of two coworkers discussing workload. The second response shifts the roles from coworkers to a parent-child relationship, which introduces confusion and lacks continuity with the conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
