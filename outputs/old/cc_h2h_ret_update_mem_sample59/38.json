    "memory_text": "Neighbors A and B have a strong desire to begin this weekend and eagerly anticipate it. They share a friendly relationship and take pleasure in each other's company. Both neighbors have a history together and reminisce about past experiences.\n\nInitially, Neighbors A and B are not well acquainted but express a mutual interest in spending more time together. As they reconnect after a while, they engage in catching up conversations. They both enjoy being outdoors and don't mind tasks like mowing the lawn. Neighbor A, however, feels the pressure to maintain a perfect appearance due to their mom's expectations.",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm sure you will have a great relationship with your kids. It's all about understanding and communication.",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The conversation is between Neighbors A and B, and the past memories relate to experiences they have shared. Response 1 continues in the context of their ongoing conversation, reaffirming the ideas of understanding and communication shared between them. Response 2, however, introduces a new speaker (\"Parent\"), which does not align with the context of Neighbors A and B's conversation. Therefore, Response 1 has better memorability by maintaining coherence with the past interactions between the two neighbors.\n\nChoice: 1"
