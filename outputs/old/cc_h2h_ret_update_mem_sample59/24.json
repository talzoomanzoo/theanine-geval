    "memory_text": "Neighbors A and B, who have known each other for years, plan to hang out once a week, possibly watching a movie, getting coffee, or just talking. They are on friendly terms and enjoy spending time together. Neighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A. They reminisce about past events and cherish their friendship.",

Response 1 addresses the situation between the neighbors directly and acknowledges the apology within that context. Response 2 introduces an external character (\"Parent\"), which does not relate to the conversation on hand and introduces irrelevant content, showcasing a lack of memorability toward the ongoing discussion between the neighbors.\n\nChoice: 1"
