Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nNeighbors B: I know you meant well, but I wasn't quite ready for a cold plunge. Let's stick to warmer activities next time.\nRESPONSE 2\nParent: I know you meant it as a joke, but getting pushed into cold water is not exactly my idea of fun.

    "memory_text": "Neighbors A and B started spending more time together, eventually becoming good friends who have known each other for years. They catch up frequently, reminiscing about past events and planning to hang out once a week. Neighbors A enjoys the support and comfort Neighbor B provides, while Neighbor B suggests cooking together and shows consideration by offering extra water for lawn mowing.",

    "prediction": "Explanation: The response should reference past memories relevant to the conversation at hand. Given the limited information, Response 1 continues the theme of discussing future activities that don't involve cold water. Response 2, however, mistakenly refers to the speaker as a \"Parent,\" which isn't relevant or recalled from the past conversation, decreasing memorability in the context of the dialog.\n\nChoice: 1"
