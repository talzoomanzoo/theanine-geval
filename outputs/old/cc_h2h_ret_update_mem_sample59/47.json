Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it.\nCo-workers B: That's not the same thing, Co-workers A. Stealing someone and keeping them against their will is illegal and immoral. You need to let go of this obsession and move on.\nCo-workers A: I know you're right, Co-workers B. I just don't know how to get over this feeling.\nCo-workers B: Maybe try talking to someone about it. A therapist or a trusted friend. They can help you work through these emotions in a healthy way. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers A: You're right, Co-worker B. I'll consider seeking help to work through this. Thank you for being there for me.\nRESPONSE 2\nParent: I appreciate your suggestion, Co-worker B. I think seeking help is a good idea. Talking to someone might give me a new perspective on how to handle these intense emotions. Thank you for being supportive and understanding.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",

    "prediction": "Explanation: The conversation involves two co-workers, A and B, and is focused on Co-worker A's emotions and their struggle with obsessive feelings towards someone. Both responses provide closure to the advice given by Co-worker B about seeking help and talking to someone about the situation. However, Response 2 introduces a third character, \"Parent,\" which does not align with the context of the conversation between co-workers. This disrupts the continuity and memorability of the participants and their roles in the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 1"
