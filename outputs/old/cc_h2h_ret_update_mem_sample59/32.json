    "memory_text": "Neighbors A and B, who have known each other for years, enjoy spending time together and want to get to know each other even better. They reminisce about past events and plan to hang out once a week, possibly watching a movie, getting coffee, or just talking. Both neighbors enjoy spending time outside and doing chores like mowing the lawn. Additionally, Neighbor A particularly enjoys spending time in Neighbor B's cozy home and wants to hang out more often.",

    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither of the responses makes direct reference to specific past memories mentioned in the conversation. However, Response 2 makes an indirect reference to lawn mowing by suggesting working on the lawn together next time, which ties back to Neighbor A's recollection of mowing the lawn with the old push mower. This slight reflection of a past memory makes Response 2 more memorable than Response 1, which only acknowledges being good friends.\n\nChoice: 2"
