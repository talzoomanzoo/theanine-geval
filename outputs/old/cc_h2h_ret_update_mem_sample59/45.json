    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it.\nCo-workers B: That's not the same thing, Co-workers A. Stealing someone and keeping them against their will is illegal and immoral. You need to let go of this obsession and move on. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers A: I know you're right, Co-worker B. I'll try to let go of this obsession and respect her choices. Thanks for being honest with me.\nRESPONSE 2\nParent: I understand that you're feeling strongly about this, but it's important to respect the bride's autonomy and wishes. It's not healthy to try to control someone else's life or decisions. Let's focus on supporting her happiness, even if it means letting go.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",

    "memory_text": "- Co-worker A felt guilty about borrowing a pencil from Co-worker B without asking, similar to how they intervened to separate two women in a fight.\n- Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that intervening in the fight was not a big deal and suggested making it up by buying coffee next time, showing their supportive nature.\n- Co-worker A's bravery and willingness to help were commended by Co-worker B, who admires their resilience and positivity, even in challenging situations like the accident where they lost their hands and feet.",

    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses do not directly reference past memories. However, Response 1 reflects on the past conversation by acknowledging Co-workers B's advice about letting go of the obsession, thus focusing on the immediate conversation which mentions the pencil borrowing incident as a point of reflection for Co-workers A. By responding to Co-workers B's concern directly, Co-workers A shows understanding of the moral point being discussed in the present.\n\nChoice: 1"
