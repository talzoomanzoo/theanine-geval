That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I totally get what you mean. It's always good to be informed about what we're eating. Would you be up for trying a plant-based burger together sometime?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: I would go for the tres leches cake with fresh raspberry jam sauce and lemon drizzle. It sounds like the perfect combination of sweet and tangy flavors. Enjoy your meal!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 1 continues the conversation about trying plant-based burgers, which aligns with Speaker A's expressed interest in trying them. Response 2, on the other hand, introduces a dessert option unrelated to the ongoing conversation about burgers, cloning, and dietary preferences. This makes it inconsistent with the current topic of discussion.\n\nChoice: 1"
