Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\nSpeaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient! \nSpeaker A: Wow, that gives me a completely different perspective. You'd really be ok with seeing me? You don't think it would be a conflict of interest since we're friends?\nSpeaker B: No not at all but if you didn't feel comfortable talking to me I can recommend a couple of my colleagues who are just as brilliant \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I appreciate the offer, and I'll definitely think about it. It's good to know that therapy can have an endpoint for some people.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: I've learned a lot about the advancements in technology and industry that have shaped this area. It's fascinating to see how far we've come.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 is consistent with the current conversation. It directly addresses the offer and the idea that therapy can have an endpoint, which was part of the preceding dialogue. Response 2, on the other hand, is inconsistent because it introduces an unrelated topic about advancements in technology and industry, which has no connection to the conversation about therapy and the offer from Speaker B.\n\nChoice: 1"
