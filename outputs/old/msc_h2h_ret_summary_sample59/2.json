Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I'll be in Costa Rica for about a week. I can't wait to explore the rainforests and beaches!\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: I'm planning to stay for about a week. I want to make the most out of the Easter weekend and spring break. Lol, I'm excited to drive my new car there!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nThere are no past memories provided to compare the information in the responses against. However, based on the given current conversation, Speaker B is going to Costa Rica, and the mention of exploring rainforests and beaches is relevant to the location. Response 1 is consistent as it mentions exploring natural attractions in Costa Rica. Response 2, however, contains a contradictory bit of information as it states \"I'm excited to drive my new car there\", which does not align with the fact that Speaker B is flying to Costa Rica (as indicated by the mention of purchasing plane tickets).\n\nChoice: 1"
