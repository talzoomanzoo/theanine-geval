    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: That would be awesome! I'll make sure there's some time for swimming and programming on the cruise too.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: That would be awesome! We could have a blast together. Plus, I've signed up for some snorkeling trips, so you can enjoy the music while I explore underwater.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nBoth responses maintain consistency with no contradiction to the past memories, as no specific past information is provided in the conversation to validate against contradicting information. However, they do build on the current conversation without conflicting with any prior context offered in the conversation itself, since Speaker B implies enjoyment of Speaker A's company by mentioning a cruise. Response 2 introduces snorkeling, which does not contradict teaching swimming or the thematic idea of a cruise someone might imagine occurring, so neither response introduces logical inconsistencies or contradictions to past memories.\n\nChoice: tie"
