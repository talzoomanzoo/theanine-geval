    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: No, I've never been to the Caribbean, but it sounds like a fantastic place to visit. I'm looking forward to learning how to swim and programming with your guidance.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: No, I've never been to the Caribbean but it sounds amazing! I can't wait to hear all about your snorkeling adventures when you get back.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are consistent with the current conversation as there is no past memory provided that contradicts any details given. Speaker B states they have never been to the Caribbean in both responses, which aligns with Speaker A's question. Response 1 expresses anticipation for learning and programming, while Response 2 expresses excitement about hearing about adventures, both of which are consistent. However, neither response contains contradictions, so it's not possible to choose one over the other based on consistency alone.\n\nChoice: tie"
