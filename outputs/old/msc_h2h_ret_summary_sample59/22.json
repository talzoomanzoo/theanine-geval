That's really exciting! \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Definitely! I'm looking forward to seeing how the cloning process unfolds.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: That's awesome! I can't wait to see the new dish. It's great that you get to enjoy it for free. Let me know how it tastes when you try it.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response contains information that directly contradicts any past memory, but Response 1 is more aligned with the context of working in the lab and the excitement about the cloning process. Response 2 introduces an irrelevant topic of a new dish, which is unrelated to the cloning of the cow and working in a lab, making it less consistent with the current conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
