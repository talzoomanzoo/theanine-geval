Have you ever done therapy?   \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I've never done therapy, but I can see how it could be beneficial. What made you decide to start your own practice?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: Thank you, that means a lot! My parents are supportive, but they just want me to do what makes me happy. I'm sure your parents feel the same way about your decision to pursue teaching. It's important to follow your passion.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",

Response 1 remains consistent as it continues the topic of therapy and asking about Speaker B's practice, which aligns with the current conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
