    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I've tried a Beyond Burger before, and I have to admit, it was surprisingly close to the real thing!\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: I wish I could, but unfortunately, the free meals don't include dessert. But I do get to take home any leftover baked goods, so I always have a sweet treat waiting for me after my shifts.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 is consistent with the conversation about trying plant-based burgers, as Speaker A directly addresses the question posed by Speaker B about trying Beyond Burgers. Response 2, on the other hand, shifts the topic to an unrelated subject about free meals and desserts, which contradicts nothing in the given memories but is not relevant to the conversation at hand.\n\nChoice: 1"
