That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I agree, it's hard to know for sure where our food comes from. I'll keep working hard in the lab and school.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: That sounds amazing! Chicken parmesan is one of my favorites too. I bet it tastes even better because it's free. Can't wait to see the pic!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: There is no mention of chicken parmesan or a picture in the current conversation or past memories. The mention of these in Response 2 introduces elements not present or hinted at in the conversation, making it inconsistent. Response 1 is consistent with the ongoing conversation about working in the lab and uncertainty about the source of food.\n\nChoice: 1"
