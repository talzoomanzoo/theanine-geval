    "prediction": "Explanation: The conversation involves Speaker A talking about teaching Speaker B to swim and going on a cruise to the Caribbean. Speaker A mentions that they have never been to the Caribbean, and B confirms they haven't either. Response 2 states that it would be awesome to have Speaker B on future cruises, which makes sense since A has expressed excitement about going on a cruise, has plans for future ones, and teaching B to swim. Response 1 also mentions keeping B informed but does not contradict any information. Both responses are consistent with the current conversation as no past memories were provided. \n\nChoice: tie"
