    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\nSpeaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car?\nSpeaker B: Yes, there are several. Hope we could meet and You possibly teach me about computer programming.\nSpeaker A: That would be great too. I like to program in several different languages. Do you have a preference? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I don't have a preference yet, but I'm eager to learn more about them.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: I've always been interested in learning Python. That would be really cool to learn from you while listening to some punk music on a cruise ship.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nBoth responses do not contradict the current conversation or the past memories (since there are no relevant past memories). However, Response 1 is consistent with the lack of specific information given in the conversation about Speaker B's preferences in programming languages. Response 2 adds specific information (\"always been interested in learning Python\") that wasn't mentioned earlier but does not contradict prior statements.\n\nChoice: tie"
