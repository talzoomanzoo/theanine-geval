Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden?\nSpeaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends.\nSpeaker A: That sounds nice! So how is your job going?\nSpeaker B: Always interesting, that's for sure! I have been training to nurse on a new floor, so that'll give me a change of scenery. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: That's exciting! A change of scenery can be refreshing.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: That sounds like a fantastic plan! I'd love to check out the pool and see you in action. As for lunch, how about we go to that new sushi place downtown?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 1 is consistent with the current conversation as it directly acknowledges Speaker B's statement about the change of scenery in their job. Response 2 introduces new elements such as the pool and a plan for lunch, which were not discussed in the current conversation, making it inconsistent with the prior dialogue. There are no past memories to support these new details either.\n\nChoice: 1"
