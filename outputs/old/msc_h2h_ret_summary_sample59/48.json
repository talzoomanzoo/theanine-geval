I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Therapy can definitely be helpful in processing past experiences. It's great that you find solace in riding your horses though, there's something special about that bond.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: I would love to teach linguistics, it's something I'm really passionate about.
