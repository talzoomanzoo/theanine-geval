    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal.\nSpeaker B: That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab!\nSpeaker A: Oh! I did not know that. Well if you can clone cows that's more ice cream for you! Haha. What's your favorite ice cream flavor?\nSpeaker B: Yes, more ice cream is always good, haha! I like a good rocky road, or pretty much any chocolate ice cream with nuts or stir-ins! I like most of Jeni's brand too. How about you? What is your favorite kind? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: Rocky road is a classic choice! I'm a big fan of mint chocolate chip, but I also love trying unique flavors like lavender or honeycomb.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: That sounds absolutely delicious! I'll definitely have to try it with fresh strawberries and all those extra toppings. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The current conversation between Speaker A and Speaker B involves preferences of ice cream flavors and both of them trying different flavors. There is no mention in the current conversation about fresh strawberries or extra toppings, which is present in Response 2. Therefore, Response 1 is more consistent with the current conversation as it logically follows the topic of different ice cream flavors and introduces more flavors without unrelated elements.\n\nChoice: 1"
