    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\nSpeaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient! \nSpeaker A: Wow, that gives me a completely different perspective. You'd really be ok with seeing me? You don't think it would be a conflict of interest since we're friends? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I appreciate your concern, but as a professional, I always maintain strict boundaries with my clients. I believe I could provide you with the support you need without any conflicts.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: It's amazing how much history shapes our world today. It's great to see your passion for robotics and computer science, and I'm sure you'll make a fantastic teacher in that field. Your parents must be proud of your dedication and hard work.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The current conversation is about Speaker B's profession as a therapist and Speaker A expressing interest in therapy. Response 1 directly addresses Speaker A's concern about potential conflict of interest due to their friendship, which maintains consistency with the conversation. Response 2, however, introduces unrelated topics such as robotics, computer science, and teaching, which are inconsistent with the past memory and current conversation about therapy.\n\nChoice: 1"
