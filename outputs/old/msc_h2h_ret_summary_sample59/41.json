Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden?\nSpeaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends.\nSpeaker A: That sounds nice! So how is your job going?\nSpeaker B: Always interesting, that's for sure! I have been training to nurse on a new floor, so that'll give me a change of scenery.\nSpeaker A: Does that add a lot of extra work to your plate? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: It definitely keeps me on my toes, but I'm excited for the new challenge.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: That sounds like a plan!

Therefore, it lacks consistency with the given details.\n\nChoice: 1"
