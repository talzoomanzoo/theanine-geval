    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Therapy can definitely have a beginning, middle, and end, and it's great to hear about your positive experiences with your horses. Let me know if you ever decide to give therapy a try, I'd be more than happy to help.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: Therapy is definitely a process that can have a completion point, especially when specific goals or issues have been addressed and resolved. It's all about working towards personal growth and healing. And remember, just like riding horses, therapy can also be a form of self-care and support.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Since there are no past memories provided, we can only assess the consistency based on the current conversation. Both responses do not contradict any information presented in the conversation. Response 1 acknowledges the possibility of completing therapy and respects Speaker A's positive experience with horses. Response 2 provides additional information about therapy being a process with completion points and draws a parallel to horse riding as self-care, which does not contradict the conversation either.\n\nChoice: tie"
