    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\nSpeaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient! \nSpeaker A: Wow, that gives me a completely different perspective. You'd really be ok with seeing me? You don't think it would be a conflict of interest since we're friends?\nSpeaker B: No not at all but if you didn't feel comfortable talking to me I can recommend a couple of my colleagues who are just as brilliant\nSpeaker A: I'd prefer to see you since I'm already comfortable talking to you! It will get the awkward part out of the way for me! \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: That's great to hear! I'm glad you feel comfortable with me. We can definitely work on addressing those unresolved childhood traumas together.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: I completely understand. If you feel comfortable talking to me, then I'm more than happy to help. It's important to feel at ease when discussing personal matters, so if that's with me, then I'm here for you.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are consistent with the given conversation. In the conversation, Speaker A expresses their comfort with discussing personal matters with Speaker B, and Speaker B is open to providing therapy to Speaker A. Response 1 acknowledges Speaker A's comfort and addresses the specific issue of \"unresolved childhood traumas,\" which is consistent with what Speaker A mentioned earlier. Response 2 reiterates Speaker B's understanding of the importance of comfort when discussing personal matters, aligning with Speaker A's preference to work with someone they are already comfortable with. Neither response contains contradictions to the memories or conversation.\n\nChoice: tie"
