    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you  \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Thank you, I appreciate your willingness to teach me how to swim. I'm excited for our meetup this weekend!\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: That's awesome! I can't wait to learn from you. And after our swimming lesson, we can enjoy that pizza burger in the pool with some punk music blasting in the background. It's going to be a perfect day.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are consistent with the conversation and do not contradict any past memories (since there are no past memories provided). However, Response 1 is more general and stays closer to the given dialogue, while Response 2 adds specific details about eating a pizza burger, which was not mentioned in the conversation. Without context, this is neither consistent nor inconsistent, but it introduces a new element without basis. Given the absence of past memories that include or exclude pizza burgers, there isn't a direct inconsistency, thus making Response 2 more imaginative than contradictory.\n\nChoice: tie"
