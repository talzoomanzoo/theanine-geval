Have you ever been there? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: No, I haven't been to Costa Rica. That sounds like an exciting trip! Have you planned out what you're going to do there?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: Costa Rica sounds amazing! I've never been there, but I've heard it's a beautiful place with so much to explore. Are you all set with your packing or still in the last-minute rush?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The choice between Response 1 and Response 2 depends on the consistency of information provided by Speaker A with respect to past memories. Since there are no past memories provided, there is no specific information that might contradict anything Speaker A says. Both responses do not contradict any memories because none are given, so neither response violates consistency based on unknown past memories.\n\nChoice: tie"
