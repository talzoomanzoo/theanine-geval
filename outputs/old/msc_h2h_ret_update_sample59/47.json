    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?   \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I've never done therapy, but I can see how it could be beneficial. What made you decide to start your own practice?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: No, I've never been to therapy, but I can imagine how beneficial it could be. I usually find solace in spending time with my horses. They're great listeners, even if they can't talk back!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nThere are no past memories given to check for consistency with the responses. However, both options are consistent with the context of the conversation. Response 1 is a neutral follow-up question that stays on the topic of therapy and Speaker B's career. Response 2 includes an additional personal detail about Speaker A's preferences, which doesn't introduce inconsistency but adds a bit more personal context. Both responses do not contradict anything in the conversation or any past memories (since none are provided). Therefore, both responses are equally consistent with the conversation as shared.\n\nChoice: tie"
