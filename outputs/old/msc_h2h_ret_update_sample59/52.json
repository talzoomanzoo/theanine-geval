Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\nSpeaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient! \nSpeaker A: Wow, that gives me a completely different perspective. You'd really be ok with seeing me? You don't think it would be a conflict of interest since we're friends? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I appreciate your concern, but as a professional, I always maintain strict boundaries with my clients. I believe I could provide you with the support you need without any conflicts.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: I appreciate your trust in me, but due to professional ethics, I wouldn't be able to see you as a client since we're friends. However, I can help you find a suitable therapist who can provide you with the support you need. It's important to have a safe and unbiased space for therapy.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The current conversation implies that Speaker A and Speaker B are friends, which could present a conflict of interest if Speaker B were to act as Speaker A's therapist. Professional ethics typically discourage therapists from treating friends to maintain objectivity and avoid boundary issues. Response 1 contradicts this professional standard by suggesting Speaker B could still accommodate Speaker A as a client despite their friendship. Conversely, Response 2 acknowledges the ethical constraints and suggests finding another therapist, which is consistent with typical professional practice.\n\nChoice: 2"
