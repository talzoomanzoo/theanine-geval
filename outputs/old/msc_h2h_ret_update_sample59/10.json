Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\nSpeaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing? \nSpeaker B: He's doing well! He just finished theatre camp and he's fighting with my sister because he wants to dye his hair green hahaha.\nSpeaker A: Young people today really have different values than our generation had. Acting sounds like it would be personally rewarding. I also like the arts. I play guitar and piano. You mentioned that you have a poll. That sounds refreshing in the hot weather.\nSpeaker B: Yes it's great, but it hasn't stopped raining here! How's the weather where you are?\nSpeaker A: Sorry for the typo. I meant \"pool\". Weather here is very hot and humid. It is miserable if you don't have air conditioning. Pollen count is also very high, so the air quality is poor.  \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: That sounds rough! Hopefully, the weather will improve soon.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: I can imagine how uncomfortable that must be with the humidity and poor air quality. Make sure to stay hydrated and indoors as much as possible. Hopefully, the weather clears up for you soon!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are consistent with the conversation and the information provided. Neither response introduces new information or contradicts the past conversation. Both responses acknowledge the weather conditions mentioned by Speaker A and offer sympathy and well wishes for improvement. Given that consistency is the only criterion, both responses are equally consistent.\n\nChoice: tie"
