    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I agree, it's hard to know for sure where our food comes from. I'll keep working hard in the lab and school.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: I appreciate your kind words! It's definitely a tough decision to balance everything. And you're right, with advancements in technology, it's getting harder to discern where our food comes from. Who knows, maybe one day we'll all be enjoying burgers from cloned cows without even realizing it!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are consistent with the conversation. Speaker B acknowledges Speaker A's comment about the uncertainty of food sources in both responses. The mention of lab and school in Response 1 aligns with the previous conversation about balancing classes and lab work, while Response 2 acknowledges the difficulty of balancing everything and agrees with Speaker A's thoughts about food sources. Neither response contradicts any past memories, as no past memories were provided.\n\nChoice: tie"
