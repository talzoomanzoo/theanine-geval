Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Therapy can definitely be helpful in processing past experiences. It's great that you find solace in riding your horses though, there's something special about that bond.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: It's interesting that you find therapy in riding horses. Horses can be incredibly therapeutic animals. Maybe exploring your love for horses and how it ties into your past could be a valuable avenue to explore in therapy.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Based on the criterion of consistency, Response 2 aligns well with the current conversation because it acknowledges Speaker A's interest in horses and suggests incorporating this interest into therapy. It does not contradict anything said previously. Response 1 also does not contradict previous statements and complements Speaker A's personal therapy method of riding horses. Both responses are consistent with the conversation's context. \n\nChoice: tie"
