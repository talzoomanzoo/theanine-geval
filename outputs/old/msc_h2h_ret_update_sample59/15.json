    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: No, I've never been to the Caribbean, but it sounds like a fantastic place to visit. I'm looking forward to learning how to swim and programming with your guidance.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: No, I haven't been to the Caribbean. It sounds amazing, but I'm still a bit hesitant about cruises because I can't swim.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "I'm unable to determine a better response based solely on the given criterion as there's no past memory data provided. However, considering the consistency aspect, neither response contradicts the current conversation. Both responses align with the dialogue about never visiting the Caribbean.\n\nChoice: tie"
