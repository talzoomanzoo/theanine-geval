    "prediction": "Explanation: The criterion of consistency dictates that the response should not contain information that contradicts past memories, although none are provided in this prompt. Both responses generally offer supportive advice that aligns with the current conversation and do not introduce inconsistencies or contradictions. However, Response 2 introduces an unknown speaker (\"Unknown\") which could suggest a lack of consistency regarding who is speaking, whereas Response 1 clearly maintains the existing mentor-mentee dialogue, thus preserving continuity.\n\nChoice: 1"
