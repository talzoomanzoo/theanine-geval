Like nobody was really listening to you?\nParent: Yeah, it was tough. I felt so alone and scared, and I didn't know if anyone would understand what I was going through.

    "memory_text": "The parent values independence and self-sufficiency, which is why they decided to live on their own a few years ago. This decision was influenced by their desire to provide a safe and stable environment for the child. \nThe parent's past experience of being in juvenile detention and going through a tough time when they got arrested led them to appreciate small moments and find hope even in difficult situations. This ultimately shaped their decision to live in a little house in the suburbs that they love.",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate how you're always there to listen to me. It means a lot to feel understood by you.",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are consistent with the current conversation. Response 1 acknowledges the parent's ability to listen, which is a recurring theme in the conversation, and appreciates feeling understood by the parent, which aligns with the previous acknowledgment of feeling heard. Response 2 expands on this by emphasizing the value of the parent's listening skills and their impact on the child, as well as possibly others. This aligns with the parent's expressed belief in the importance of listening to give advice or let someone feel heard. Neither response contradicts any past memories or current conversation facts.\n\nChoice: tie"
