    "prediction": "Explanation: The task requires a choice based on consistency with past memories. However, no past memories are provided; hence, there are no specific details that either response can contradict. Both responses discuss the process of adjusting to a new place and emphasize the importance of time and effort in building a new support system or friendships. Since there is no information that either response could conflict with, they are equally consistent relative to the current conversation's context.\n\nChoice: tie"
