    "memory_text": "Neighbors A and B plan to hang out once a week, possibly watching a movie, getting coffee, or just talking. They have not seen each other in a while and are catching up. Neighbors A mentioned mowing the lawn with an old push mower, indicating they are responsible for the yard work. This leads to a conversation about both enjoying spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn.",

However, Response 2 introduces an unrelated subject about workplace communication and teamwork, which contradicts the current conversation between Neighbors A and B. Therefore, Response 1 is more consistent.\n\nChoice: 1"
