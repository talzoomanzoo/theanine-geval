Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else.

    "prediction": "Explanation: \nIn this conversation, there are no specific past memories mentioned that need to be recalled in the response. Since neither response draws on any specific past memories, we should consider the responses' implied memorability with regard to understanding the situation and reflecting general values or sentiments that might have been shared before. Response 2 indirectly references shared values (\"our values of kindness and positivity\"), potentially indicating a memory or understanding among coworkers about how they typically approach issues, which gives it a slight edge in terms of \"Memorability\" as it calls back to mutual understanding rather than a specific memory.\n\nChoice: 2"
