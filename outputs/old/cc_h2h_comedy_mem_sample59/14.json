I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends.\nMentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\nMentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here.\nMentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nMentee: I appreciate your suggestions, Mentor. I'll look into joining some clubs or organizations to meet new people. Thanks for always being there for me.\nRESPONSE 2\nUnknown: Mentee: Mentor, I really appreciate your advice. I will try to step out of my comfort zone and join some clubs or volunteer opportunities to meet new people. It's just hard to put myself out there sometimes.\n\nMentor: I completely understand, Mentee. It's natural to feel hesitant, but remember that every new connection starts with a simple hello. And remember, you have always been resilient and courageous in the face of challenges. I have seen you grow and overcome obstacles with grace and determination. Just take one step at a time and believe in yourself. You have the strength and courage to make new friends and create meaningful relationships in this new city.

Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process, feeling overwhelmed with the college application process, and took shoes from the store without paying because they couldn't afford them.\n- The Mentor has been guiding and supporting the Mentee in their work for years, causing the Mentee to be offered a job and deciding to take the job in the city.",

    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response makes a reference to any specific past memory from the conversation or suggests any recollection of past events or conversations. However, Response 2 attempts to provide a more detailed and encouraging reflection on Mentee's past resilience and courage, which may imply a recognition of past experiences, though not specific to this conversation context. As both responses mainly provide support and encouragement without delving into specific memories, Response 2 demonstrates a bit more effort in referring to the Mentee's past character that has presumably been shown in prior experiences.\n\nChoice: 2"
