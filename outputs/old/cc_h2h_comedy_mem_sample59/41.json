Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers A: I was just joking, Co-worker B. I would never actually do something like that.\nRESPONSE 2\nUnknown: Co-workers B: I understand that you want to protect the bride, but kidnapping her is not the right way to go about it. We need to find a solution that doesn't involve taking drastic measures. Let's brainstorm together and come up with a plan that will ensure her safety without causing harm. Your intentions are good, Co-workers A, but we need to find a better way to handle this situation.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",

    "memory_text": "1. Co-worker A witnessed a fight and intervened to separate the two women. Co-worker B is supportive and willing to help in any way. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\n2. Co-worker B commended Co-worker A for their bravery and willingness to help. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\n3. Co-worker B mentioned helping a customer resolve an issue last week, showing a willingness to assist others. Co-worker A is alive but will need time to adjust to their new way of life.",

    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response reflects any past memories, as no such memories are provided in the context. Both responses address Co-worker A's statement in the present conversation. Response 1 acknowledges that Co-worker A's statement was a joke and reassures Co-worker B that there is no real intent behind it. Response 2 suggests a constructive approach to solving the problem with Co-worker B, albeit with an assumption of Co-worker A's intentions. Since past memories are not a focal point in either response, both are similar in terms of memorability.\n\nChoice: tie"
