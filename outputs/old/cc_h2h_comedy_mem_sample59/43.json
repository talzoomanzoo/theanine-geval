I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings.

Love can make us do crazy things sometimes.\nRESPONSE 2\nUnknown: Co-workers B: I understand that you care deeply for the bride, Co-workers A, but kidnapping her is not the answer.

Let's find a way to support her in a healthy and respectful manner, rather than resorting to drastic measures. Remember, true love is about understanding and acceptance, not control.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
