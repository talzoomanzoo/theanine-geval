It's an important skill to have in life.\nChild: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you.\nParent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you.\nChild: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you?\nParent: Yeah, it was tough. I felt so alone and scared, and I didn't know if anyone would understand what I was going through. But eventually, I found someone who was willing to listen and it made all the difference.\nChild: I'm glad you found someone to talk to. You know, I remember when we watched the sunrise together a few weeks ago. That was really special.\nParent: It was. I love being able to appreciate the beauty of nature.

Your support and understanding mean the world to me.\n\n I'll always be here for you, no matter what. We make a great team, don't we?\n\n We sure do.

    "prediction": "Explanation: \nThe criterion is Memorability, which focuses on recalling past memories. Response 1 recalls a specific past event where the Parent moved into their own place, which directly aligns with the Parent's mention of valuing independence and living on their own. This response connects well with the memories discussed in the conversation. Response 2, on the other hand, while meaningful and emotional, does not specifically tie back to the individual past memories mentioned, such as the Parent's independent living or significant moments like moving into their own place.\n\nChoice: 1"
