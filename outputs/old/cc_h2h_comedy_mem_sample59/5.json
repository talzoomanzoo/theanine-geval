    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses recall the past memory of watching the sunrise together. However, Response 2 not only acknowledges the memory but also ties it back to the current theme of being there for each other and emphasizes the parent's commitment to listening, which relates to the earlier shared memory of feeling alone and finding someone to listen. Therefore, Response 2 reflects a higher degree of memorability by linking the past memory to the ongoing conversation theme and expressing emotional support.\n\nChoice: 2"
