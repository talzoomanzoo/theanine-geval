Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it.\nCo-workers B: That's not the same thing, Co-workers A. Stealing someone and keeping them against their will is illegal and immoral. You need to let go of this obsession and move on. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers A: I know you're right, Co-worker B. I'll try to let go of this obsession and respect her choices. Thanks for being honest with me.\nRESPONSE 2\nUnknown: Co-workers B: Co-workers A, I understand that you have strong feelings for the bride, but kidnapping her is not the answer. It's important to respect her choices and feelings. Remember how we always support each other and strive to make the world a better place through kindness and support? Let's find a healthier way to deal with your emotions and move forward in a positive direction.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",

    "memory_text": "- Co-worker A felt guilty about borrowing a pencil from Co-worker B without asking, similar to how they intervened to separate two women in a fight.\n- Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that intervening in the fight was not a big deal and suggested making it up by buying coffee next time, showing their supportive nature.\n- Co-worker A's bravery and willingness to help were commended by Co-worker B, who admires their resilience and positivity, even in challenging situations like the accident where they lost their hands and feet.",

    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses address Co-workers A's feelings for the bride and emphasize the importance of respecting her choices and feelings. However, Response 2 better reflects past memories by referencing the mutual support and kindness that Co-workers A and B strive for, although it's not explicitly stated in the past memories given. The mention of mutual support and making the world a better place is memorable as it aligns with the underlying values that Co-workers B encourages Co-workers A to consider.\n\nChoice: 2"
