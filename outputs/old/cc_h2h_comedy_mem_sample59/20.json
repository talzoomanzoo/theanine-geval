    "prediction": "Explanation: Since there are no past memories provided, the response that best attempts to establish a connection by recalling or hinting at past experiences would have better memorability. Response 2 adds elements like cooking and enjoying each other's company, suggesting a history of shared activities even though they were not explicitly mentioned before. This adds a layer of recalling shared experiences, thus increasing its memorability. However, Response 1 focuses solely on the immediate situation without connecting it to wider past experiences or building on the relationship history.\n\nChoice: 2"
