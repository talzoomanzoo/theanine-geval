Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life.\nChild: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you.\nParent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you.\nChild: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nParent: I did feel that way at times, but I learned the importance of listening and being heard through those tough experiences. It's something I try to remember every day.\nRESPONSE 2\nParent:  Yeah, I remember when you were in detention. It was really tough, but I tried my best to listen and support you. I know how important it is to feel heard, especially during difficult times. I'm always here for you, no matter what.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",

    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response directly references past memories explicitly. However, Response 2 demonstrates an attempt at drawing upon a past shared experience of the child being in detention, which is more aligned with the child's query and could thus have stronger memorability. Whereas Response 1 largely speaks in generalities without pinpointing a specific shared memory or experience.\nChoice: 2"
