    "memory_text": "The parent values independence and self-sufficiency, which is why they decided to live on their own a few years ago. This decision was influenced by their desire to provide a safe and stable environment for the child. \nThe parent's past experience of being in juvenile detention and going through a tough time when they got arrested led them to appreciate small moments and find hope even in difficult situations. This ultimately shaped their decision to live in a little house in the suburbs that they love.",

It specifically recalls watching the sunrise together, a part of their recent shared history which was discussed earlier in the conversation. This response not only ties back to a shared experience but elaborates on the importance and emotional connection from that memory, thereby providing higher memorability over the conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
