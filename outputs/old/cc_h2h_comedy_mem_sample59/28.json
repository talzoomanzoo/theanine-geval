    "memory_text": "Neighbors A and B plan to hang out once a week, possibly watching a movie, getting coffee, or just talking. They have not seen each other in a while and are catching up. Neighbors A mentioned mowing the lawn with an old push mower, indicating they are responsible for the yard work. This leads to a conversation about both enjoying spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn.",
