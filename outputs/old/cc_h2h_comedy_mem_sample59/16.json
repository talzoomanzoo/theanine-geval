    "memory_text": "1. The Mentor acknowledges the Mentee's work in advocacy for women and girls and praises their dedication to their values, causing Mentee to agree to go back to the store to make things right and express gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n\n2. Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace in reaction to the Mentor believing the Mentee's work has been influential and that they will continue to make an impact in the world.\n\n3. The Mentee hopes to inspire others to join the cause of gender equality and fighting discrimination, wanting to express gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process. This leads to Mentee feeling overwhelmed with the college application process, which is on the same topic as Mentee taking shoes from the store without paying because they couldn't afford them.",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you, Mentor. I appreciate your support and advice. I'll make an effort to stay connected with my old friends while also exploring new opportunities to meet people in the city.",
    "prediction": "Explanation: In comparing the two responses, the first response by the Mentee acknowledges the mentor's advice and reflects on the importance of staying connected with old friends while also taking new steps to meet people in the city. It directly recalls the suggestion made by the Mentor to schedule video calls and keep in touch with old friends, thus showing memorability in the context of the current conversation. The second response introduces an \"Unknown\" speaker, which is inappropriate in the context of the dialogue and does not directly recall specific suggestions from the Mentor. Therefore, based on Memorability, the first response is more relevant as it effectively incorporates the mentor's advice related to past memories of maintaining old friendships.\n\nChoice: 1"
