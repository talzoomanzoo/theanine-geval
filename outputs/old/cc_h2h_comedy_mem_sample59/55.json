    "memory_text": "Co-worker A has been feeling off lately, but is grateful to Co-worker B for letting them borrow the horse and is having a great time riding her. This has motivated Co-worker A about the future and they are excited to work with Co-worker B. Co-worker B, who offered help and support to Co-worker A, is glad the trade worked out well for both of them. Additionally, Co-worker B is impressed with Co-worker A's well-thought-out plans for their partnership. Both co-workers believe they have the potential to create something great together.",

    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses reference past events. Response 1 recalls the conversation about plans for the future and expresses excitement about working on the project, directly tying to Co-workers B's memory recall about their prior discussion. Response 2 introduces an unrelated memory about lending a horse, which does not connect to anything mentioned earlier in the conversation and might be considered an error or a fictional addition. Therefore, Response 1 better aligns with the given conversation and memory recall by focusing solely on the previously mentioned project plans.\n\nChoice: 1"
