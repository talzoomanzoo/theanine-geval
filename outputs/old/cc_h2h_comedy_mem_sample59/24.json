    "memory_text": "Neighbors A and B, who have known each other for years, plan to hang out once a week, possibly watching a movie, getting coffee, or just talking. They are on friendly terms and enjoy spending time together. Neighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A. They reminisce about past events and cherish their friendship.",

    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response reflects any past memories in this conversation since no past events prior to the conversation are referenced. However, response 2 provides more reflection on the current situation by acknowledging the intention behind the act and expressing a desire to focus on enjoying their time together, which adds depth to moving past the incident. There's an emphasis on continuing to build their friendship, which may imply creating memories, but it does not directly reference any past memories.\n\nChoice: tie"
