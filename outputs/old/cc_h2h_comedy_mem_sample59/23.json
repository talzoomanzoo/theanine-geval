    "memory_text": "1. Neighbors A and B are excited to start this weekend and are looking forward to it. They haven't seen each other in a while and are catching up. Neighbor B is being comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A.\n\n2. Neighbors A and B, who are not well acquainted, express their desire to spend more time together. As they catch up after a long time, they discuss the temperature inside the house compared to the hotter weather outside. This leads to Neighbor A's mom scolding them for removing the tag from a new shirt.\n\n3. They make plans to hang out weekly, considering activities like watching a movie, getting coffee, or simply talking. Neighbor B, who enjoys cooking, suggests cooking together. Furthermore, Neighbor B's thoughtful suggestion of having extra water available for when Neighbor A mows the lawn shows mutual consideration.",

Response 2 references shared activities such as \"making homemade pizzas and hosting dinner parties,\" which suggests a recall of past experiences indicating those activities as positive memories shared between the neighbors. This makes Response 2 more memorable as it explicitly reflects the intention to create meaningful experiences together based on past shared activities.\n\nChoice: 2"
