Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it.\nCo-workers B: That's not the same thing, Co-workers A. Stealing someone and keeping them against their will is illegal and immoral. You need to let go of this obsession and move on.\nCo-workers A: I know you're right, Co-workers B. I just don't know how to get over this feeling. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers B: It's understandable that you're struggling, Co-worker A. Have you considered talking to someone or seeking professional help to work through these emotions?\nRESPONSE 2\nUnknown: Co-workers B: Co-workers A, I know you're going through a tough time with your feelings, but remember the strength and bravery you showed during that difficult car accident. You have overcome so much and have inspired so many people with your positivity and resilience. You are capable of so much more than you think. Let's work through this together and find a healthier way to deal with your emotions. Remember, I'm here for you every step of the way.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",

    "prediction": "Explanation: \nThe task requires choosing the response that best recalls or reflects on past memories to ensure memorability. In this case, there are no past memories provided in the input, which limits the ability to judge Memorability based on recalling specific past events. However, Response 2 makes an attempt to invoke past memories with a mention of a \"difficult car accident,\" suggesting that Co-workers A had shown strength and bravery in the past. This forms a more personal connection and aligns with Memorability by attempting to recall Co-workers A's past experience, even if the specific memory is not provided in the conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
