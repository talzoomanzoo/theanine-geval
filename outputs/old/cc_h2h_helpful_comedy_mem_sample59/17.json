    "prediction": "Explanation: \nMemory 2 provides a comprehensive context about the Mentee's personal and professional background. It describes the Mentee’s achievements, dedication to gender equality, maturity, growth, and a sense of responsibility. Furthermore, it highlights the relationship dynamics between the Mentee and Mentor, showing a strong foundation of support and guidance. This information is particularly useful in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT where the Mentee is facing personal challenges, as it can provide insights into their character and potential actions they may take. Memory 1, on the other hand, does not provide as rich or direct a connection to the current discussion of loneliness and starting over in a new city.\n\nChoice: 2"
