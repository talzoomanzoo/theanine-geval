You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\n\nMEMORY 1\n1.

    "prediction": "Explanation: \nMemory 2 provides a richer context and more relevant information regarding the relationship between Co-workers A and B. It highlights their supportive relationship, shared values, and provides specific examples of events where Co-worker B praises Co-worker A. This could be useful in guiding Co-worker B's approach to handling the current situation in the dialogue context, particularly in terms of maintaining respect and the shared values they evidently have. On the other hand, Memory 1 lacks depth and specific relevant situations that connect to the current conversation about respecting choices and feelings.\n\nChoice: 2"
