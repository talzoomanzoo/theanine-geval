It's an important skill to have in life.\nChild: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you.\nParent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you.\nChild: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you?\nParent: Yeah, it was tough. I felt so alone and scared, and I didn't know if anyone would understand what I was going through. But eventually, I found someone who was willing to listen and it made all the difference.\nChild: I'm glad you found someone to talk to. You know, I remember when we watched the sunrise together a few weeks ago. That was really special.\nParent: It was. I love being able to appreciate the beauty of nature. And you know, having my own place to live in the suburbs makes it even easier to do things like that.\nChild: Yeah, your house is really nice. You've always been good at taking care of yourself.\nParent: Well, I've always valued my independence. Even as a kid, I wanted to do things on my own. That's why I decided to live on my own a few years ago.\nChild: I can see why you would want to do that. You're just really good at being self-sufficient.\nParent: Thanks for saying that. But I still think one of the most important things I can do for others is listen. Whether it's to give advice, or just to let someone feel heard.\n\nMEMORY 1\nThe parent values independence and self-sufficiency, which is why they decided to live on their own a few years ago. This decision was influenced by their desire to provide a safe and stable environment for the child. \nThe parent's past experience of being in juvenile detention and going through a tough time when they got arrested led them to appreciate small moments and find hope even in difficult situations.
