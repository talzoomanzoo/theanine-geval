A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\nSpeaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk?\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker B enjoys nature and works with animals, which is why they are an artist who walks through nature for work. Currently, Speaker B is re-reading 'Redwall' by Brian Jacques, a favorite book from their childhood. Speaker A, who is a fan of the Game of Thrones series and enjoys audiobooks, recommends \"A Game of Thrones\" by George R.R. Martin. Speaker A, a city dweller who walks to work, emphasizes the importance of proper form in exercise to prevent injuries.\n\nMEMORY 2\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Artwork and Inspiration', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A inquires about Speaker B's artwork and how nature walks inspire them.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: You know, ever since I got my new phone I started listening more to music and audiobooks - the speakers are so good! That's what I'm doing with the next GOT book, they have this great narrator with a really deep voice that makes it sound so dramatic. ### Speaker B: I could probably enjoy that when I'm doing my nature walks.  That's really the only time i'm able to listen to anything. ### Speaker A: Would that distract you from your artwork, though? I know you find inspiration during those walks. ### Speaker B: Yes! I tried it, but it just mixes up my mood and emotions too much, and I lose my muse.  Same with reading. I have to have absolute silence when I read. I do find inspiration in the walks.  It sort of empties out my mind, and I need that sometimes.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like. ###Speaker B: That's great!

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides more detailed and relevant context about Speaker B's interest in how nature walks inspire their artwork. It also includes past dialogues where Speaker A and Speaker B discussed listening activities during walks, which directly relates to the current conversation about a nature walk. This memory would better inform Speaker A's response by providing insight into how these nature walks are important and inspiring to Speaker B. MEMORY 1, while it includes some relevant details about Speaker B's interest in nature and Speaker A's preferences, does not directly connect to how nature walks relate to Speaker B's experiences or considerations during the walks.\n\nChoice: 2"
