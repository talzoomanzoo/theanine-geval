A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\nSpeaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk?\nSpeaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous.\n\nMEMORY 1\n- Speaker B, who lives in the country and loves nature, is currently re-reading 'Redwall' by Brian Jacques, a favorite book from their childhood. This has been hindered by their new painting project, which has been keeping them busy and away from reading. Speaker B prefers silence while reading and creating artwork to stay focused.\n\nMEMORY 2\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Artwork and Inspiration', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A inquires about Speaker B's artwork and how nature walks inspire them.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: You know, ever since I got my new phone I started listening more to music and audiobooks - the speakers are so good! That's what I'm doing with the next GOT book, they have this great narrator with a really deep voice that makes it sound so dramatic. ### Speaker B: I could probably enjoy that when I'm doing my nature walks.  That's really the only time i'm able to listen to anything. ### Speaker A: Would that distract you from your artwork, though? I know you find inspiration during those walks. ### Speaker B: Yes! I tried it, but it just mixes up my mood and emotions too much, and I lose my muse.  Same with reading. I have to have absolute silence when I read. I do find inspiration in the walks.  It sort of empties out my mind, and I need that sometimes.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like. ###Speaker B: That's great!

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more helpful because it includes information about Speaker B’s connection between nature walks and their artwork inspiration. The dialogue context involves a nature walk, and the related memory discusses how such walks inspire Speaker B and the importance of having silence during them. This directly relates to the context and would potentially guide Speaker B to discuss how the nature walk might inspire their artwork or how they relate to the silence and focus required.\n\nChoice: 2"
