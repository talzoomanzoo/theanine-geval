Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\nSpeaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing? \nSpeaker B: He's doing well! He just finished theatre camp and he's fighting with my sister because he wants to dye his hair green hahaha.\nSpeaker A: Young people today really have different values than our generation had. Acting sounds like it would be personally rewarding. I also like the arts. I play guitar and piano. You mentioned that you have a poll. That sounds refreshing in the hot weather.\nSpeaker B: Yes it's great, but it hasn't stopped raining here! How's the weather where you are?\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation.\nSpeaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\nSpeaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break, and wants to go on a trip but has not started packing yet.\n\nMEMORY 2\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Family growth', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A reflects on how her youngest grandchild is growing up fast, now at 14 years old.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: She's 14, so still has a few years to go.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides some context around Speaker B's upcoming plans for Easter and spring break, which could potentially relate to their travel plans to Costa Rica. However, it lacks immediate relevance because the trip is already booked. On the other hand, MEMORY 2, focusing on family growth and Speaker A's grandchildren, could be connected to Speaker B's mention of their nephew and his theater camp and interests. This line of conversation could be further expanded upon with more personal and family-related anecdotes, making MEMORY 2 more relevant and helpful given the current dialogue context. \n\nChoice: 2"
