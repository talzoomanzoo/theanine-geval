A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\nSpeaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk?\nSpeaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous.\nSpeaker B: That sounds amazing! Did you bring a pet? I love doing the harder trails with my dog. Sometimes, it's very peaceful to get away from everything.\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker A enjoys reading fantasy books and recommends \"A Game of Thrones\" by George R. R. Martin. Speaker A also enjoyed reading 'Redwall' growing up and keeps an eye out for similar books. Speaker B enjoys reading the Odd Thomas and Dark Tower series and finds inspiration for their artwork during nature walks. Speaker A recommends the new album by Highly Suspect to Speaker B.\n\nMEMORY 2\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Artwork and Inspiration', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A inquires about Speaker B's artwork and how nature walks inspire them.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: You know, ever since I got my new phone I started listening more to music and audiobooks - the speakers are so good! That's what I'm doing with the next GOT book, they have this great narrator with a really deep voice that makes it sound so dramatic. ### Speaker B: I could probably enjoy that when I'm doing my nature walks.  That's really the only time i'm able to listen to anything. ### Speaker A: Would that distract you from your artwork, though? I know you find inspiration during those walks. ### Speaker B: Yes! I tried it, but it just mixes up my mood and emotions too much, and I lose my muse.  Same with reading. I have to have absolute silence when I read. I do find inspiration in the walks.  It sort of empties out my mind, and I need that sometimes.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like. ###Speaker B: That's great!

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more relevant to the current dialogue context because it provides information about Speaker B's interest in finding inspiration for their artwork during nature walks. This directly relates to Speaker B's appreciation for peaceful escapes in the dialogue context. MEMORY 2 also establishes a previous conversation involving Speaker B's nature walks and their preferences, adding depth to the interaction. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, does not contain information that is directly relevant to the current discussion about nature walks and therefore provides little benefit in generating a subsequent response. \n\nChoice: 2"
