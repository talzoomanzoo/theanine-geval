Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker B's interest in becoming a therapist stemmed from their mom being a nurse and busy with work. This led Speaker B to discuss the profession's ups and downs, including the concern about the cost of owning horses and considering the psychological aspects of horse ownership in relation to Freudian theories.\n\nMEMORY 2\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'experience in practice', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker B talks about their training and experience in their therapy practice.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: I had to train for a while with other people before I was fully certified and licensed, but I've now been working in my own practice for about six years.  It's going alright.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? ###Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job! ###Speaker A: That sounds really great.

    "prediction": "Explanation: \nMEMORY 1 talks about the personal background and motivations of Speaker B for becoming a therapist, including a connection to family influences and an interest related to horses, which Speaker A mentions as a form of therapy for themselves. This could be relevant if the conversation were to deepen into personal anecdote sharing or exploring the psychological aspects of such interests. However, MEMORY 2 specifically brings up Speaker B's training, experience, and professional background in therapy practice, which directly relates to Speaker A's consideration of starting therapy. This information is more pertinent given Speaker A's hesitance and the suggestion to consult with Speaker B professionally.\n\nChoice: 2"
