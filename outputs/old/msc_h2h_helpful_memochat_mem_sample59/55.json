A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker A enjoys reading fantasy books and recommends \"A Game of Thrones\" by George R because Speaker A also enjoyed reading 'Redwall' growing up and keeps an eye out for similar books. \nSpeaker B is an artist who walks through nature for work and finds inspiration for their artwork during nature walks. Speaker B lives in the country, loves nature, and works with animals. Speaker B is interested in Pilates but dislikes the idea of having to follow specific steps in exercise.\n\nMEMORY 2\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Artwork and Inspiration', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A inquires about Speaker B's artwork and how nature walks inspire them.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: You know, ever since I got my new phone I started listening more to music and audiobooks - the speakers are so good! That's what I'm doing with the next GOT book, they have this great narrator with a really deep voice that makes it sound so dramatic. ### Speaker B: I could probably enjoy that when I'm doing my nature walks.  That's really the only time i'm able to listen to anything. ### Speaker A: Would that distract you from your artwork, though? I know you find inspiration during those walks. ### Speaker B: Yes! I tried it, but it just mixes up my mood and emotions too much, and I lose my muse.  Same with reading. I have to have absolute silence when I read. I do find inspiration in the walks.  It sort of empties out my mind, and I need that sometimes.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like. ### \n\n``` Speaker A Input:\nRecent Dialogs: Speaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like. ### \n\n``` Speaker A Input:\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nMEMORY 1 provides background information about Speaker B's love for nature, nature walks, and how they relate to their work as an artist. This memory suggests that Speaker B finds inspiration in nature walks, making it highly relevant to Speaker A's comment about a great nature walk. This can guide Speaker B's response and potential interest in the nature walk mentioned by Speaker A.\n\nMEMORY 2 contains related evidences such as previous dialogues between the speakers, where Speaker B expressed how contextual factors like music or audiobooks affect their inspiration during nature walks. While this is also informative, it repeats some themes already encapsulated in MEMORY 1 but also introduces potentially distracting factors which are less directly relevant to Speaker A's immediate comment.\n\nChoice: 1"
