    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 offers direct insight into Speaker B's professional background, highlighting their six years of experience in their therapy practice after completing necessary training and certification. This is more relevant to the dialogue as Speaker A is contemplating therapy and Speaker B's professional credentials would reassure Speaker A about considering therapy with Speaker B. In contrast, MEMORY 1, while providing personal insights into Speaker B's interests and background, does not directly relate to or enhance the ongoing conversation about therapy completion or Speaker B’s qualifications as a therapist.\n\nChoice: 2"
