A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker B, a high school student preparing for college, works at a diner at night but is considering giving up their job to focus on lab work and school. Additionally, Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, displaying an interest in neuroscience. Speaker A offers to take Sparky for a walk to help out and spend time with the dog, as Speaker B's dog is deaf and needs to be kept on a lead due to recall difficulties.\n\nMEMORY 2\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Work and School Plans', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B discuss their future plans regarding school, work, and potential job opportunities.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: You bet! How's the lab work going? Are you learning anything new with the research? ### Speaker B: We just did some interesting new things on genome sequencing.  We are going to try to clone a jersey cow next year. ### Speaker A: That's intense. How much longer do you have left in school? I'm just a freshman but I'm trying to get through it all in 3 years. ### Speaker B: Just two more weeks! I'm thinking about taking classes this summer to get a head start on my freshman year at college though. ### Speaker A: I did that my first summer and recommend it, you make such a close group of friends with your classmates! And it knocks a class off your schedule, which is also nice ### Speaker B: Yes!  I may have to give up my night job though.  They have told me at the lab they would be able to give me more hours there in the fall, which will help.  Especially since i want to major in molecular biology! ### Speaker A: So what I'm hearing is that I better come get some of that casserole ASAP lol' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow?

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides detailed and specific information related to the lab work that Speaker B is involved in, including their excitement about cloning a cow, their school plans, and their considerations about balancing school with work opportunities. This information is directly related to the dialogue context, as it pertains to Speaker B's lab work and future aspirations, thus offering more insights that can benefit Speaker B's response. In contrast, MEMORY 1 contains less relevant details to the current conversation, focusing more on Speaker B's personal life and dog care, which doesn't directly align with the topic of the lab work discussion.\n\nChoice: 2"
