    "prediction": "Explanation: I apologize for the interruption. Let's proceed with evaluating the helpfulness of the given memories.\n\nMEMORY 1 provides information about Speaker B's previous plans and experiences related to Sweden, including that Speaker A and Speaker B had plans to travel together, which was not mentioned in the recent dialogue. However, MEMORY 1 does not provide much context that could help Speaker B respond more effectively to Speaker A's latest question regarding staying in pediatrics.\n\nMEMORY 2 contains richer details about Speaker A and Speaker B's conversations on traveling to Sweden, Speaker B's experiences growing up there, and some personal preferences such as visiting local coffee shops. While it does not directly address Speaker A's latest question, it could assist Speaker B in providing more personalized comments about Sweden and their experiences and preferences there.\n\nTherefore, MEMORY 2 is more helpful as it offers more detailed context related to the ongoing conversation about Sweden, which can be extended into a conversation about travel in future responses.\n\nChoice: 2"
