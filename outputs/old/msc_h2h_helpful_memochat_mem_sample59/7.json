Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\nSpeaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing? \nSpeaker B: He's doing well! He just finished theatre camp and he's fighting with my sister because he wants to dye his hair green hahaha.\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation. \nSpeaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one. \nSpeaker B dyed their hair with henna and enjoys experimenting with different hair colors. \nSpeaker A is getting their hair dyed turquoise by their youngest grandchild, who wants to pursue hairdressing as a profession.\n\nMEMORY 2\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Family growth', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A reflects on how her youngest grandchild is growing up fast, now at 14 years old.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: She's 14, so still has a few years to go.
