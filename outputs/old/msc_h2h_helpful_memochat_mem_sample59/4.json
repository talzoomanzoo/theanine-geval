    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 directly relates to Speaker B's trip to Costa Rica, which is being discussed in the dialogue. It covers Speaker B's excitement about the trip, mentioning the duration of the stay, and connects to Speaker B's personal style, which shows a level of openness to experiences—this relates to cultural exploration plans in Costa Rica. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, doesn't connect to the current dialogue context about travel plans or book discussions, focusing instead on family growth which is not relevant to the current conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
