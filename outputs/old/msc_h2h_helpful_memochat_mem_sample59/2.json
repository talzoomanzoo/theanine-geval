Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break. This excitement led Speaker B to dye their hair with henna and enjoy experimenting with different hair colors. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one. Both Speaker A and Speaker B have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation. Speaker A has a granddaughter who is a cosmetologist and helped dye their hair in streaks. Speaker A is getting their hair dyed turquoise by their youngest grandchild, who wants to pursue hairdressing as a profession. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet, showing their excitement for the upcoming adventure.\n\nMEMORY 2\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Hair dyeing experience', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A successfully dyed her hair with turquoise streaks on each side, suggested by her granddaughter.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: Well, my hair has been dyed! ### Speaker B: How did it come out?

You can tell that being a cosmetologist is her passion, she was an absolute natural with keeping my nerves at bay. ### Speaker B: At least it's less permanent than a drastic hair cut would be.  You've got extra flavor now. Did you stick with just a streak or did you go bigger? ### Speaker A: We decided to do a streak on each side, for balance. And they're not just out in the open but under a layer of hair, so it pops out when I wear a ponytail. My granddaughter suggested that, how creative!' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet? ###Speaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica!

    "prediction": "Explanation: Both MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 contain similar information related to Speaker A's hair dyeing experience and their interaction with their grandchildren. However, neither MEMORY directly addresses the conversation about the trip to Costa Rica. MEMORY 1 mentions Speaker B's excitement about an upcoming trip, which aligns more closely with the dialogue context concerning their plans to visit Costa Rica. This makes MEMORY 1 slightly more relevant to the current dialogue, as it provides more context about Speaker B's adventurous plans, which could lead to a more connected continuation of the conversation for Speaker B.\n\nChoice: 1"
