This led them to start their own practice six years ago.

They expressed interest in owning a horse in the future, contemplating the psychological aspects of it in relation to Freudian theories. Additionally, Speaker B, being a therapist and a football fan supporting the Chiefs, acknowledged the professional boundaries by not engaging in relationships with clients.\n\nMEMORY 2\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'experience in practice', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker B talks about their training and experience in their therapy practice.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: I had to train for a while with other people before I was fully certified and licensed, but I've now been working in my own practice for about six years.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides more context about Speaker B's career as a therapist, including specific details like starting their own practice six years ago and their passion for helping others. It also includes additional personal information about Speaker B, such as their interest in Freudian theories and being a football fan, which can be helpful in furthering the conversation. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, lacks narrative details and offers only a vague reference to Speaker B's training and experience, which is less helpful in continuing the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 1"
