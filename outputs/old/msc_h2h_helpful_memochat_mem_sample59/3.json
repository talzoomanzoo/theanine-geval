A more helpful MEMORY should have more, richer information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with “1”, “2\", or “tie”)\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\n\nMEMORY 1\nSpeaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break, which is why Speaker B dyed their hair with henna and enjoys experimenting with different hair colors. Speaker A, a retired librarian, used to have quiet spring breaks, but now recommends the book \"Beautiful Ruins\" by Jess Walter for a beach visit.\n\nMEMORY 2\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Family growth', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A reflects on how her youngest grandchild is growing up fast, now at 14 years old.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: She's 14, so still has a few years to go. It's wild to think that she's my youngest but already getting to be so big.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet? ###Speaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica!

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 is more helpful because it directly relates to the topic of reading books, which is relevant to Speaker B's question about whether Speaker A has read any good books lately. The memory mentions Speaker A recommending the book \"Beautiful Ruins\" by Jess Walter, which is a perfect segue into discussing books. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, focuses on Speaker A's reflection on a family member growing up, which is not directly connected to the current topic of conversation about travel and reading.\n\nChoice: 1"
