Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy?

You'd really be ok with seeing me? You don't think it would be a conflict of interest since we're friends?\nSpeaker B: No not at all but if you didn't feel comfortable talking to me I can recommend a couple of my colleagues who are just as brilliant\nSpeaker A: I'd prefer to see you since I'm already comfortable talking to you!

Speaker B has been working in their own therapy practice for about six years, experiencing the ups and downs of the profession. This led to Speaker B becoming a professional in a practice where it is illegal for them to have relationships with clients.\n\nMEMORY 2\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'experience in practice', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker B talks about their training and experience in their therapy practice.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: I had to train for a while with other people before I was fully certified and licensed, but I've now been working in my own practice for about six years.

Let's proceed with the evaluation of the memories based on the criteria provided.\n\nExplanation: MEMORY 2 provides more directly relevant details regarding Speaker B's experience and practice as a therapist, including their training and professional background, which can support the ongoing conversation with Speaker A. This relates to the context of Speaker A considering therapy with Speaker B. It's more directly related to the dialogue as it reinforces Speaker B's qualifications and experience. \n\nMEMORY 1, while providing some information about Speaker B’s interests and length of practice, introduces unrelated topics such as working in a stable and legal restrictions, which are not pertinent to the immediate conversation about providing therapy to Speaker A.\n\nChoice: 2"
