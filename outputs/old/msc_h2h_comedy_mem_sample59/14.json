    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: That would be awesome! I'll make sure there's some time for swimming and programming on the cruise too.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A:  Thanks for offering to teach me how to swim, I really appreciate it. Maybe after I learn, we can plan that cruise we've been talking about. I'll bring some pizzaburgers for us to enjoy on the deck!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response references any past memories, as there are no past memories provided that are relevant to the current conversation example. Without past memories to reflect upon, both responses focus on the present conversation. However, Response 2 introduces a memorable element by mentioning pizzaburgers, which adds a unique detail to the imagined future event (the cruise) even without specific prior memories. This makes it slightly more memorable despite not directly recalling any past memories.\n\nChoice: tie"
