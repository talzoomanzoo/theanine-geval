    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal.\nSpeaker B: That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab!\nSpeaker A: Oh! I did not know that. Well if you can clone cows that's more ice cream for you! Haha. What's your favorite ice cream flavor?\nSpeaker B: Yes, more ice cream is always good, haha! I like a good rocky road, or pretty much any chocolate ice cream with nuts or stir-ins! I like most of Jeni's brand too. How about you? What is your favorite kind?\nSpeaker A: I am a big fan of cookie dough ice cream, and I love cheesecake flavored ice creams too! Ben & Jerry has some that I like, but I prefer to get ice cream from an ice cream shop.  It's just something about being in that environment,\nSpeaker B: Yes, ice cream shops are the best! They have stir-ins, and the smells are heavenly! Ben and Jerry's used to have a blueberry cheesecake that was amazing! I have only had that and their strawberry flavors. Both were great! \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I'll have to try Ben & Jerry's blueberry cheesecake flavor next time! It sounds delicious.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A:  I can't wait to try your chili dog casserole at the diner! It sounds delicious. And I'm so excited to see you continue your studies in molecular biology. Have you thought about how cloning could be used in neuroscience research?\n Thank you! I'm glad you're excited to try it. And that's a great idea about using cloning in neuroscience research. I haven't really thought about it, but it's definitely something worth exploring. Maybe I can incorporate that into my future studies!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The criterion for the choice is Memorability, or the reflection of past memories in the conversation. Looking at the conversation, we see there is a discussion around desserts like ice cream, and a topic of cloned cow research. \n\nResponse 1 logically follows the discussion of Ben & Jerry's ice cream flavor and is directly related to the immediate preceding conversation about ice creams and ties back to the specific mention of Ben & Jerry’s blueberry cheesecake that Speaker B enjoyed. \n\nResponse 2 introduces a completely new topic – a chili dog casserole at a diner, which is not mentioned at all earlier in the conversation. It also talks about a study in molecular biology and neuroscience research, which is not previously part of the conversation. As such, response 2 doesn’t reflect past memories from the conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
