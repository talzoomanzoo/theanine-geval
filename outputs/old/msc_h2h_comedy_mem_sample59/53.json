    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\nSpeaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient! \nSpeaker A: Wow, that gives me a completely different perspective. You'd really be ok with seeing me? You don't think it would be a conflict of interest since we're friends?\nSpeaker B: No not at all but if you didn't feel comfortable talking to me I can recommend a couple of my colleagues who are just as brilliant \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I appreciate the offer, and I'll definitely think about it. It's good to know that therapy can have an endpoint for some people.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A:  I would love to help you out with therapy, especially since we're friends. I value our relationship and I think it can bring a unique perspective to our sessions. Plus, it's always good to have someone you trust to talk to. And don't worry, being a Chiefs fan and enjoying football won't be a conflict of interest!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 1 reflects on the conversation accurately by acknowledging Speaker B's offer and the concept that therapy can have an endpoint, which was discussed previously. Response 2, on the other hand, introduces new, unrelated topics such as being a Chiefs fan and enjoying football, which were not mentioned in the past memories or the current conversation. Therefore, Response 1 has better memorability as it directly relates to the discussed topic and previous points in the conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
