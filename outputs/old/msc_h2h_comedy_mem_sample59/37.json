    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I'm hoping to visit Sweden again soon, maybe this summer. I miss playing tennis and going to church on Sundays there.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B:  I would love to go back to Sweden someday, maybe to visit my parents. It's been a while since I've been back, but the memories are so special to me. I miss the coffee shops and the delicious chocolates. Maybe we can plan a trip together sometime in the future!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response directly references specific past memories from a shared history between the speakers as no past memories are provided. However, between the two, Response 2 introduces a personal element, mentioning Speaker B's parents, coffee shops, and chocolates. These details, while not reflecting shared memories with Speaker A, suggest personal recall relevant to Speaker B's experience with Sweden, which could potentially spark deeper connection if past shared experiences in Sweden or related topics had been discussed previously.\n\nChoice: 2"
