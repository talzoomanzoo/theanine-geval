    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: No, I've never been to the Caribbean, but it sounds like a fantastic place to visit. I'm looking forward to learning how to swim and programming with your guidance.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B:  I'm glad you're open to trying new experiences like going on a cruise with me. It's going to be a great time in the Caribbean. I think you'll enjoy the adventure and relaxation it has to offer. Plus, we can have some pizza burgers on board!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses discuss future events and activities, but Response 2 reflects more on past conversations regarding going on cruises, trying new experiences, and their shared interest in having pizza burgers. However, given that the offered memories do not explicitly mention cruises or pizza burgers as past memories, neither response strongly references past memories. Response 1 is more directly aligned with the discussion about learning how to swim and programming with Speaker A's guidance, which aligns with what was discussed in the current conversation. \n\nChoice: 1"
