    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: That's exciting! How's the planning going so far?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: Response:  I've been thinking about taking on a second part-time job to save up for my trip to Sweden to visit my cousin. I know it's going to be worth it to experience all the local music and coffee shops there. Maybe we can even check out some jamband music or classic reggae while I'm there!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response directly reflects any specific past memories as no past memories have been provided in the scenario. Therefore, both responses have equally low memorability from unavailable past context. However, Response 2 introduces a personal anecdote related to Sweden, which adds some level of relevance and personalization to the conversation even without past memory context.\n\nChoice: 2"
