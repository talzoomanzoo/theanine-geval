    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: You should definitely add the Icehotel in Jukkasj√§rvi to your list of must-sees in Sweden!\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: Response: You should definitely check out the local coffee shops in Sweden, they have amazing coffee and chocolates. I can ask my cousin for some recommendations for you. And since you enjoy jamband music and reggae, you might want to explore the music scene there as well. I'm sure you'll have a great time exploring Sweden!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response directly taps into any specific past memories, as no past memories have been provided for reference in this scenario. However, Response 2 hints at a past memory that is not provided in the current context by mentioning Speaker A's preferences for jamband music and reggae. This suggests a familiarity with Speaker A's interests that could be a reflection of past conversations or memories. Though it's not grounded in the given past memories, it does imply a layer of recognition and personalization that could enhance memorability if those interests had indeed been specified in previous interactions.\n\nChoice: 2"
