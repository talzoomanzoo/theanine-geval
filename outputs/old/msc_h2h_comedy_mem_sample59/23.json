    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: Definitely, I'd be curious to try it! It would be interesting to see if there's any difference in taste.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: Response: I really hope I can continue working in the lab even when classes get tough. I'm really excited about the cloning project! And yeah, I would totally eat a hamburger from a cloned cow. It's all about advancing science and innovation, right? Plus, I bet it would taste just as delicious as the ones I make at the diner!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses show enthusiasm about eating a hamburger from a cloned cow. However, Response 2 adds more depth by relating to Speaker B's concern about balancing classes and work, expressing personal excitement about continuing the project, and making a connection with Speaker A's experience of making hamburgers at the diner. This shows an effort to relate to past conversations or shared experiences, demonstrating higher Memorability.\n\nChoice: 2"
