    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\nSpeaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing? \nSpeaker B: He's doing well! He just finished theatre camp and he's fighting with my sister because he wants to dye his hair green hahaha.\nSpeaker A: Young people today really have different values than our generation had. Acting sounds like it would be personally rewarding. I also like the arts. I play guitar and piano. You mentioned that you have a poll. That sounds refreshing in the hot weather. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Yes, having a pool will definitely be a lifesaver in the warm Costa Rican weather! Speaking of green hair, I hope your nephew wins that battle with your sister. Oh, and I'm sure you'll enjoy the beach in Costa Rica, especially with that book you recommended.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B:  Your nephew sounds like a character with his green hair! It must be fun to see him express himself creatively. Speaking of hair, I recently dyed my hair turquoise with the help of my grandchildren. They had a blast doing it! I'm considering trying out purple or blue next. It's great to have family members who support our choices, like your daughter with her cosmetology passion. \n\n That's so cool that you dyed your hair turquoise! I bet purple or blue would look fantastic on you as well. It's wonderful to have family who are supportive and encouraging. Do you have any book recommendations for a beach visit? I'm always looking for new reads to enjoy while relaxing by the ocean.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The given conversation does not contain any references to Speaker A having a daughter or talking about cosmetology, so response 2 introduces new and inaccurate past memories, which doesn't align with the current conversation or create an accurate memorable recollection. On the other hand, response 1 correctly recalls the mention of the nephew's desire for green hair and connects it smoothly to the conversation about the trip to Costa Rica, staying consistent with the details shared in the conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
