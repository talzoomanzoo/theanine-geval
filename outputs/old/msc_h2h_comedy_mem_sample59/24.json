    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I agree, it's hard to know for sure where our food comes from. I'll keep working hard in the lab and school.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: Response: Thanks for the encouragement, I really appreciate it. I'll try my best to balance everything. And I totally get what you mean about not wanting to eat a hamburger from a cloned cow. It's definitely a strange concept to think about. Maybe we can stick to our usual burger joints for now.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response directly incorporates any specific past memory, as no past memories were provided. However, between the two responses, they both equally engage with the present conversation. Response 1 highlights Speaker B's commitment to working hard in the lab and school, while Response 2 acknowledges Speaker Aâ€™s concerns about cloned beef and ends with a friendly suggestion about sticking to usual choices. Both responses stay on topic with the current conversation and provide an acknowledgment of Speaker A's points. In the absence of past memories, neither response has increased Memorability over the other.\n\nChoice: tie"
