    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden?\nSpeaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends.\nSpeaker A: That sounds nice! So how is your job going?\nSpeaker B: Always interesting, that's for sure! I have been training to nurse on a new floor, so that'll give me a change of scenery.\nSpeaker A: Does that add a lot of extra work to your plate? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: It definitely keeps me on my toes, but I'm excited for the new challenge.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B:  My job is definitely keeping me busy, but I'm excited for the change of scenery with the new floor. It's always good to keep things interesting, right? And hey, maybe the extra income from your second job will help you save up even faster for your trip to Sweden!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response 1 nor response 2 reflect back on any specific past memories mentioned in the conversation, because no past memories were provided in the context to be recalled. While response 2 speculatively connects Speaker A's potential financial situation to their trip planning to Sweden, this is not based on any past memory shared in the conversation. Between the two, response 2 makes an attempt to incorporate the ongoing theme of the Sweden trip planning, while response 1 focuses more directly on Speaker B's job training experience, albeit without referencing a past shared memory. \n\nChoice: tie"
