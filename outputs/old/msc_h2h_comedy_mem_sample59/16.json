Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I'll definitely let you know how it goes. It's going to be a fantastic experience for sure.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A:  I'm really looking forward to our meetup this weekend. I may not be the best swimmer, but I'm excited to learn. And thanks for offering to teach me. Maybe after our swimming and programming lessons, we can grab some pizzaburgers together. I could use a stress-reliever after all the swimming practice!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses refer to the upcoming meetup, but Response 2 acknowledges the offer from Speaker B to learn swimming, which creates an opportunity for shared experiences. It extends the conversation from teaching swimming to also include having fun afterwards while mentioning programming studies. This response better reflects the shared plans for the weekend, and it ties these aspects together with memorability. Mention of pizzaburgers adds an additional concrete, memorable detail despite not specifically being a past memory. \n\nChoice: 2"
