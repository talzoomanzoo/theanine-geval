    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden?\nSpeaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: That sounds like a great plan for next summer! I'll make sure to check out the beach spots you mentioned when I visit Sweden.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: Response: I miss Sweden too, especially the beaches and castles. Hopefully you can visit soon and we can catch up over a cup of coffee at one of the local spots. It's always nice to reminisce about our favorite memories and plan for the future adventures.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response directly recalls any specific past memory mentioned, such as Speaker A's planning stage or their cousin's involvement. However, Response 2 more effectively refers to past experiences with Sweden's beaches and castles, which aligns with Speaker B's mention of hitting local beach spots and loving the castles, making it slightly more memorable. Additionally, Response 2 includes a nostalgic element by mentioning reminiscing about favorite memories, which could indirectly tie into their shared interest in Sweden.\n\nChoice: 2"
