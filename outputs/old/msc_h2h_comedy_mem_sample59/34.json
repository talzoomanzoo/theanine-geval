    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I've been looking into flights and accommodations, trying to find the best deals.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: Response: \n I miss Sweden so much! How is the trip planning going? I hope you get to experience all the beauty and culture that Sweden has to offer. Maybe we can plan a trip together sometime and visit some of my favorite spots.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The current conversation is about Speaker A's progress in planning their trip to Sweden. There are no past memories provided to give any specific recall in context. Between the two responses, Response 1 focuses on the details of trip planning, concerning flights and accommodations, which directly answers Speaker B's query. Response 2, on the other hand, discusses missing Sweden and planning future trips together, which doesn't relate directly to the current focus of trip progress. Since memorability is about reflecting relevant past memories, and given no prior context for 'missing Sweden' or joint plans previously, Response 1 is more aligned to the existing conversation and demonstrates better memorability in recalling progress made in trip planning.\n\nChoice: 1"
