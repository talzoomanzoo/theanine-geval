    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\nSpeaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk?\nSpeaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous.\nSpeaker B: That sounds amazing! Did you bring a pet? I love doing the harder trails with my dog. Sometimes, it's very peaceful to get away from everything. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I didn't bring a pet this time, but I can imagine how peaceful it must be to have a furry companion on the trail with you.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A:  No, I didn't bring a pet this time. But I can imagine how peaceful it must be to do the harder trails with your dog. Nature walks are definitely a great way to get away from everything and find some inspiration. I'm glad you enjoy them with your furry companion!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Since there are no explicit past memories provided, we solely focus on the current conversation to determine memorability. Both responses recall Speaker B's mention of the dog and \"doing the harder trails.\" Response 2 mirrors more details from the conversation by acknowledging both the harder trails and the escape from everything as mentioned by Speaker B. It shows better engagement with Speaker B's experience, reflecting the essence of their past remark.\n\nChoice: 2"
