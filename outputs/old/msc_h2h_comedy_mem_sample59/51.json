    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\nSpeaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient!  \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: That's interesting to know, I didn't realize therapy could be completed in a shorter time frame for some. I'll definitely consider reaching out to you for a session.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A:  Wow, it's amazing to hear about your success with clients completing their therapy journey. It must be so rewarding to see them grow and move forward in their lives. And it's great to know that therapy can have a clear end point for some people.\n\n Absolutely, it's truly fulfilling to see the progress and positive changes in my clients' lives. And you're right, therapy is a unique experience for each individual, so it's important to tailor the process to meet their needs and goals. \n\n I really appreciate your offer to see me for therapy. I think it could be beneficial for me to explore some of my unresolved issues. And I trust that you would provide a safe and supportive environment for that journey.\n\n I'm glad to hear that you're open to the idea of therapy. It's important to take care of our mental health, just like we take care of our physical health. And I'm here to support you every step of the way. Let's work together to help you find healing and growth.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response directly recalls past specific memories, as the entire conversation is new without references to earlier topics. Therefore, both responses are measured by how well they capture and acknowledge the essence of therapy's end-point and Speaker B's offer, as well as Speaker A's initial reluctance yet openness to therapy.\n\nChoice: tie"
