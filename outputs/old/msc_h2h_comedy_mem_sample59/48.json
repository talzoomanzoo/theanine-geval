    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Therapy can definitely be helpful in processing past experiences. It's great that you find solace in riding your horses though, there's something special about that bond.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B:  It sounds like horses play a significant role in your life and bring you a sense of peace and comfort. Therapy could definitely help you work through any unresolved issues from your childhood and further enhance your well-being. Just like how you take care of your horses, it's important to take care of yourself as well.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses reflect on Speaker A's fondness for horses as a source of solace, as mentioned in the current conversation. However, Response 2 expands on this by drawing a parallel between taking care of horses and taking care of oneself, thus deepening the reflection on Speaker A's past memory of finding therapy in horse riding. Additionally, Response 2 more explicitly addresses the aspect of \"unresolved childhood trauma\" by mentioning working through unresolved issues, thus connecting to Speaker Aâ€™s mention of potential childhood trauma more directly. This makes Response 2 more memorable as it ties back to specific past memories with added depth.\n\nChoice: 2"
