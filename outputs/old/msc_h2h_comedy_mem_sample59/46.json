    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I do still enjoy being a therapist, but it definitely has its challenges. It's rewarding to help people navigate through their struggles.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B:  I can imagine that listening to people's problems all day can be draining at times, but the satisfaction of helping them must make it all worth it. Just like how taking care of your horses brings you joy and fulfillment. It's all about finding that balance between giving and receiving, and I'm sure you do a great job at it.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses offer explanations for why Speaker B still enjoys being a therapist, touching on their love for helping people. However, Response 2 introduces a hypothetical past memory of taking care of horses, which was not mentioned before in the conversation or past memories provided. While it attempts to draw a parallel between Speaker B's work and an unspecific personal joy for Speaker A, it is fabricated and doesn't reflect any actual shared memory. On the other hand, Response 1 sticks to the topic at hand and reflects the past memory of thinking it was a perfect job by showing ongoing enjoyment and acknowledgment of its challenges.\n\nChoice: 1"
