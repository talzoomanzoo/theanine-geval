    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"' \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: That sounds fascinating! Learning about history can be so enriching. Do you have any other historical fiction recommendations?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B:  I'm doing well, thank you for asking. I haven't read any new books lately, but I recently finished \"The Gettysburg Campaign\" and found it quite fascinating. Have you read any historical fiction or nonfiction books that you would recommend for my beach visit?\n\n(Note: The response is consistent with Speaker A's interest in historical fiction and nonfiction, as well as their request for book recommendations for a beach visit.)\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 2 directly reflects the past memory mentioned by Speaker A about enjoying \"The Gettysburg Campaign\" and connects it to Speaker B's recent reading experience of the same book. This recalls Speaker A's memory of reading that book and also continues the topic of historical books, which is relevant to Speaker A's interests. In contrast, Response 1 does not acknowledge any past memory or connect to the specific book Speaker A mentioned. Therefore, Response 2 has higher memorability.\n\nChoice: 2"
