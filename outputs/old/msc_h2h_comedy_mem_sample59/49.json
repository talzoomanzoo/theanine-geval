    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: That's really kind of you to offer. I might take you up on that offer, I think it could be beneficial for me.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: Response: That sounds like a great offer, thank you! I haven't done therapy before, but it might be worth a try. I appreciate your willingness to help. And by the way, I remember you mentioning you're a Chiefs fan. How are they doing this season?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response 1 nor response 2 requires recalling any past memories beyond what is mentioned in the current conversation. The conversation focuses on Speaker B's profession and Speaker A's consideration of therapy, and the past memories do not play a significant role here. However, response 2 introduces an unrelated detail about being a Chiefs fan, which isn't part of the current conversation or past memories associated with therapy, nor does it reflect strongly upon past memories or conversation. Therefore, it doesn't enhance the memorability more than response 1, which stays entirely relevant to the ongoing context.\n\nChoice: 1"
