Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting! \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Definitely! I'm looking forward to seeing how the cloning process unfolds.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B:  I'm definitely excited to see the outcome of the cloning project in the lab! It's amazing how far science has come. I'll have to make sure to celebrate with a burger after a run while listening to some music, it really helps me relax after a long day.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response explicitly recalls any past memories since there are no past memories provided. However, Response 2 introduces an element of personal routine (\"celebrate with a burger after a run while listening to some music\") which implies a habit or recurrent personal memory, enhancing its memorability by adding a layer of personal context. Response 1 simply expresses excitement without connecting to any past habit or personal memory.\n\nChoice: 2"
