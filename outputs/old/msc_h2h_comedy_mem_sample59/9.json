    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\nSpeaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing? \nSpeaker B: He's doing well! He just finished theatre camp and he's fighting with my sister because he wants to dye his hair green hahaha.\nSpeaker A: Young people today really have different values than our generation had. Acting sounds like it would be personally rewarding. I also like the arts. I play guitar and piano. You mentioned that you have a poll. That sounds refreshing in the hot weather.\nSpeaker B: Yes it's great, but it hasn't stopped raining here! How's the weather where you are? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: The weather here has been pretty mild, not too hot or cold. Hopefully, it clears up for your trip to Costa Rica!\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A:  The rain has been non-stop here, but at least it's giving me some time to plan out my next hair color experiment! I'm thinking of trying out a vibrant green next, what do you think? \n\n That sounds like a fun idea! I can picture you rocking a bright green hair color. It's great that you're always open to trying new things and expressing yourself creatively through your hair. I can't wait to see how it turns out!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses touch on the topic of weather, but Response 2 better reflects past memories by connecting to the past discussion about Speaker B's nephew wanting to dye his hair green. By mentioning planning a new hair color experiment and considering a vibrant green, Speaker A recalls the earlier topic of conversation and expresses interest that enhances memorability.\n\nChoice: 2"
