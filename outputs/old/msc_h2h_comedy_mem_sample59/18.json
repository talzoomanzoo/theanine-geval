    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\nSpeaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car?\nSpeaker B: Yes, there are several. Hope we could meet and You possibly teach me about computer programming. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: That sounds like a plan! I can definitely help you with computer programming as well during our meetup this weekend.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: That sounds like a great plan! I can definitely teach you some programming skills while we're on the cruise. And don't worry about the swimming, I'll help you overcome your fears and hopefully you'll enjoy it more. Maybe we can even watch some swimming movies together to get you more comfortable in the water. And of course, we can grab some pizzaburgers on the way back, your favorite!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Since there are no specific past memories provided, the focus should be on the conversation at hand. Both responses recall parts of the current conversation, such as the weekend meetup and teaching programming. However, Response 2 goes a step further by addressing swimming and borrowing additional context from elsewhere (such as \"pizzaburgers\").  Despite the lack of initial information about \"swimming movies\" or \"pizzaburgers\" being B's favorite, this creates a more memorable interaction by making assumptions about past knowledge, though inaccurately as it isn't supported by prior conversation evidence.  Without a connection to actual past memories, Response 2 embellishes while Response 1 sticks closer to the available context. \n\nChoice: 1"
