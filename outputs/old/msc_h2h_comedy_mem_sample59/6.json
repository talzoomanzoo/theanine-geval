    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\nSpeaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing?  \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: He's doing well, thank you for asking. He's getting ready for his birthday, and he's excited to finally be a teenager.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B:  That book sounds interesting, but I'm more into fiction. Have you read \"Where the Crawdads Sing\"? It's a great beach read, perfect for your upcoming trip to Costa Rica! And speaking of your trip, have you thought about trying a new hair color to match the tropical vibes? Maybe purple or blue would be a fun change!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response directly recalls any past memories as provided in this task. Therefore, we assess the immediate context for conversational continuity. Speaker A inquires specifically about the health and well-being of Speaker B's nephew, thus the more memorable response would be engaging with this line of questioning rather than diverging into topics of books or hair color, which do not relate to any earlier discussed topics or mentioned memories in this conversation about the nephew. Response 1 directly addresses Speaker A's question regarding the nephew by updating his status, which makes it more relevant and memorable to the ongoing conversation. Response 2 shifts focus to an unrelated topic about books and possible vacation activities, introducing new ideas unrelated to any personal mentions made.\n\nChoice: 1"
