    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I've always been interested in helping others and psychology, so becoming a therapist felt like a natural fit for me.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B:  I decided to become a therapist because I've always been passionate about helping others and understanding their needs. Just like how I take care of my horses, I want to provide support and guidance to those in need. It's fulfilling to see the positive impact therapy can have on someone's life.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The current conversation does not include any past memories provided for consideration. Therefore, neither response is linked to any past memory recall. Both responses simply elaborate on Speaker B's motivation to become a therapist, but Response 2 adds a personal anecdote about horses, which, without past memory context, does not enhance memorability and may be irrelevant. Since there are no past memories to reflect upon, memorability cannot be assessed, making both responses equally memorable or equally non-memorable in this context.\n\nChoice: tie"
