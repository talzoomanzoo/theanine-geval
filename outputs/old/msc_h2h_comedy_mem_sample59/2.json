    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I'll be in Costa Rica for about a week. I can't wait to explore the rainforests and beaches!\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B:  I'm glad you've been to Canada and Mexico, those must have been amazing trips! I plan to stay in Costa Rica for about two weeks, I'm really looking forward to exploring the rainforests and soaking up the sun on the beautiful beaches. Do you have any book recommendations for my beach visit?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response directly references past memories, as the conversation appears to be focused on a current topic that doesn't rely on a specific past memory. However, Response 2 does show a semblance of recall by acknowledging Speaker A's mention of having traveled to Canada and Mexico. Even though this is part of the current conversation, it's evidence that Speaker B is actively engaging with the information shared by Speaker A, which gives it a slight edge in terms of memorability. Response 1, on the other hand, shifts focus entirely to Speaker Bâ€™s plans without acknowledging the context provided by Speaker A, making it less reflective.\n\nChoice: 2"
