Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun! \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: That sounds awesome! I can't wait to listen to it while we hang out by the pool and then get into our programming studies.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: Response: That sounds like a great playlist! I'm excited for our meetup this weekend. I can't wait to try out the fun music by the pool and dive into our programming studies with some steady tunes. And of course, pizza burgers are always a good idea. Looking forward to our swimming lessons too - maybe one day we'll be cruising in the Caribbean together!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses refer to the playlist for the meetup, including listening by the pool and programming studies. However, Response 2 adds details about \"pizza burgers\" and \"swimming lessons,\" which are not mentioned in the past memories but could indicate past discussions or plans. Without explicit past memories included, it's hard to assess the memorability based on these additional points. Nevertheless, Response 2 reflects more potential memorability by bringing in additional activities and future aspirations.\n\nChoice: 2"
