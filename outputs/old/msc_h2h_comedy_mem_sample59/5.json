    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: \"The Gettysburg Campaign\" is about the pivotal battle during the American Civil War. It's a fascinating look at the strategies and key figures involved.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A:  Oh, \"The Gettysburg Campaign\" is actually a historical fiction novel set during the Civil War. It's filled with battles, strategy, and personal stories of soldiers. But if history isn't your thing, maybe you'd enjoy a book about hair colors and styles instead! Have you ever thought about trying out a new hair color like grey or turquoise?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses mention \"The Gettysburg Campaign,\" but Response 1 provides a more direct explanation of the book relevant to the shared interest of early American history, as discussed earlier in the conversation. Response 2 veers off-topic by suggesting books about hair colors, which is unrelated to the current conversation and past memories shared. Therefore, Response 1 more effectively recalls and reflects on past memories related to the conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
