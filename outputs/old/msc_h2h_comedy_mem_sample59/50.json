    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Therapy can definitely have a beginning, middle, and end, and it's great to hear about your positive experiences with your horses. Let me know if you ever decide to give therapy a try, I'd be more than happy to help.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B:  It's great to hear that you find therapy in riding your horses. It's important to find what works for you to address any unresolved issues. And yes, therapy can have an end point, depending on the goals you set and achieve. If you're open to it, I would be happy to work with you and support you through your journey.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses reflect back on the ongoing conversation well, discussing the idea that therapy can have a conclusion and acknowledging Speaker A's experience with finding therapy in horse riding. However, Response 2 is slightly more memorable as it ties Speaker A's horse riding experience to addressing unresolved issues, which resonates directly with Speaker A mentioning \"unresolved childhood trauma.\" Additionally, Response 2 elaborates on the aspect of setting goals and achieving them in therapy, reinforcing the idea that therapy can indeed conclude, thereby creating a stronger reflection of the conversation's nuances.\n\nChoice: 2"
