    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden?\nSpeaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends.\nSpeaker A: That sounds nice! So how is your job going?\nSpeaker B: Always interesting, that's for sure! I have been training to nurse on a new floor, so that'll give me a change of scenery.\nSpeaker A: Does that add a lot of extra work to your plate?\nSpeaker B: At the moment, yes. I'll be in Pediatrics, which has always been my passion. It's a completely different environment than the ER. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: That's great that you'll be working in Pediatrics, I'm sure it will be a rewarding experience for you.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A:  The job is going well, thanks for asking! I've been training to work in Pediatrics, which is a big change from the ER. It's definitely adding some extra work to my plate, but I'm really excited about the opportunity to work in an environment that aligns with my passion for helping children. Plus, it gives me a chance to have a different kind of impact in the hospital.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 1 acknowledges Speaker B's new position in Pediatrics and implies an understanding of their passion for it, reflecting on the information shared about Speaker B's career transition. Response 2, on the other hand, mistakenly speaks as if Speaker A is the one transitioning to Pediatrics, which is inaccurate based on the previous conversation. This inaccuracy shows a lack of reflection on past memories and disrupts the flow of the conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
