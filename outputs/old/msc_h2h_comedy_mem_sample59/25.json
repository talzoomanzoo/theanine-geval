    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I've tried a Beyond Burger before, and I have to admit, it was surprisingly close to the real thing!\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A:  I'm glad to hear you're planning to continue working in the lab! I have no doubt you'll be able to balance classes and your job. And thank you for the offer to try a Beyond burger or plant-based version, I would definitely be willing to give that a try. It's important to explore all options, especially when it comes to food and sustainability.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: No specific past memories were provided, therefore the evaluation is based solely on the dialog. Response 2 directly references Speaker B's intention to continue working in the lab, which is a key point discussed earlier in the conversation, and it expands on their conversation around trying plant-based burgers. Response 1 only responds to the question about trying a Beyond Burger and lacks the connection to previous parts of the conversation regarding the lab work. Therefore, Response 2 has higher memorability as it recalls and reflects more on past parts of this conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
