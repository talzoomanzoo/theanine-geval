    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job! \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: It's great that you found a career that aligns with your passion for helping others. Do you find that being a therapist is rewarding?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: Response: I decided to become a therapist because I've always had a passion for helping people and making a difference in their lives. I love listening and talking to people, so it just felt like the perfect fit for me. Plus, being able to connect with others and provide support brings me so much fulfillment.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The criterion is memorability, which involves recalling past conversations or experiences relevant to the current interaction. In this context, Speaker A's decision-making process and career path were not previously discussed or shared, so there are no past memories to recall. Additionally, Speaker A does not share personal memories within the current conversation. Response 1 acknowledges Speaker B's motivations and seeks further elaboration, maintaining coherence and interest in their experiences. Response 2, however, mistakenly attributes Speaker A's personal motivations for becoming a therapist, which was actually Speaker B's shared experience, not congruent with the past conversation. As there is no past shared memory for Speaker A to recall about their own career choice, Response 2 lacks accuracy, making Response 1 more fitting in this context even if both do not specifically recall any shared memory.\n\nChoice: 1"
