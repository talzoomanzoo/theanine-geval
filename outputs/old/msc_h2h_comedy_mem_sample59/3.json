    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I'm doing well, thank you for asking. I recently finished reading \"Where the Crawdads Sing\" by Delia Owens, and I highly recommend it. How about you, any new books on your reading list?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A:  I'm doing well, thank you for asking! I haven't read any good books lately, but I've been thinking about trying out a new hair color. Maybe I'll go for that grey look we joked about! Have you ever considered dyeing your hair a bold color like turquoise or red?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response directly reflects or recalls specific past memories from this interaction, as there are no past memories provided. However, Response 1 stays on topic by answering Speaker B's question about reading a good book, which maintains coherence and connection to the immediate prior conversation about books. Response 2 introduces a new topic unrelated to the conversation so far or any prior memory, but does mention a \"joke\" about hair color which implies past conversations or humor not explicitly present in previous interactions. Yet, without specific past memory references, Response 1 has slightly better memorability in terms of staying relevant to the conversation's flow.\n\nChoice: 1"
