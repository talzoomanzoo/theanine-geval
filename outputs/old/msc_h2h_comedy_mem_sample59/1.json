Have you ever been there? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: No, I haven't been to Costa Rica. That sounds like an exciting trip! Have you planned out what you're going to do there?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: Response:  No, I haven't been to Costa Rica yet, but I can imagine all the vibrant colors and nature there must be so inspiring for my next hair dye experiment! Maybe I'll come back with some tropical-inspired hues to match the scenery.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses refer to Speaker A not having been to Costa Rica before, which is consistent with the current conversation. However, neither response relates to any specific past memories, as none were provided. Hence, we must evaluate based solely on the provided conversation. Response 2 does make a more unique and imaginative reflection about the potential for inspiration from Costa Rica, suggesting a personal context or interest that could be memorable in later conversations. \n\nChoice: tie"
