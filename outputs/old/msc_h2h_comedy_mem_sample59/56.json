Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\nSpeaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I visited a local nature reserve with some beautiful trails.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: Response: I went on a nature walk in the woods near my house, it was so peaceful and inspiring. I even spotted a few deer along the way. I think you would really enjoy it, especially since you find inspiration in nature walks too.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses provide a personal account of the nature walk, but Response 2 is more memorable because it reflects on an additional detail about seeing deer, making it specific and vivid. It also relates the experience to Speaker B by mentioning their shared appreciation for finding inspiration in nature walks, which makes it a more reflective and connective response, even though the past memories don't provide explicit previous context.\n\nChoice: 2"
