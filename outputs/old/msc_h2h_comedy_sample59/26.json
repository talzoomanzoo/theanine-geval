    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I totally get what you mean. It's always good to be informed about what we're eating. Would you be up for trying a plant-based burger together sometime?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B:  I completely understand where you're coming from. It's important to prioritize your studies. And I agree, plant-based burgers are a great alternative. I'll have to try one soon! And speaking of trying new things, have you heard any interesting songs lately that you can recommend? Music always helps me relax after a long day.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nThe current conversation does not provide any specific past memories to directly reference the consistency of the responses. Therefore, we must consider the consistency of the responses within the context of the conversation itself. Response 1 continues the discussion about plant-based burgers, aligning with Speaker A's expressed interest in trying them, and proposes a potential future activity related to the topic. This is consistent with the flow of the conversation. Response 2, however, shifts the focus to music recommendations without connection to the prior discussion about lab work, cloning, or plant-based burgers. Additionally, it introduces an element about prioritizing studies that doesn't directly relate to anything Speaker A has said, making it less consistent.\n\nChoice: 1"
