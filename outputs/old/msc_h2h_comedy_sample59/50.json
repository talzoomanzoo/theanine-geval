Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Therapy can definitely have a beginning, middle, and end, and it's great to hear about your positive experiences with your horses. Let me know if you ever decide to give therapy a try, I'd be more than happy to help.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B:  It's great to hear that you find therapy in riding your horses. It's important to find what works for you to address any unresolved issues. And yes, therapy can have an end point, depending on the goals you set and achieve. If you're open to it, I would be happy to work with you and support you through your journey.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are consistent with the current conversation. Speaker B acknowledges that therapy can have an endpoint, which aligns with their earlier statement about a client successfully completing therapy. There are no specific past memories provided, so no contradictions arise from prior information we do not have. Both responses appropriately address Speaker A's reliance on horse riding as a form of therapy and the potential for formal therapy to have a resolution. Therefore, both responses are equally consistent with the conversation provided.\n\nChoice: tie"
