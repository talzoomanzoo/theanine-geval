Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I do still enjoy being a therapist, but it definitely has its challenges. It's rewarding to help people navigate through their struggles.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B:  I can imagine that listening to people's problems all day can be draining at times, but the satisfaction of helping them must make it all worth it. Just like how taking care of your horses brings you joy and fulfillment. It's all about finding that balance between giving and receiving, and I'm sure you do a great job at it.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: There is no information provided in the past memories that mentions Speaker A having horses or anything related to that. Response 2 introduces a new idea about Speaker A having horses, which could contradict any unseen past memories that don't align with this detail. Response 1, on the other hand, stays consistent with the known conversation and information, focusing purely on the speaker's experience as a therapist without assuming additional details about Speaker A.\n\nChoice: 1"
