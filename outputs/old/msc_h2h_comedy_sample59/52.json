    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\nSpeaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient! \nSpeaker A: Wow, that gives me a completely different perspective. You'd really be ok with seeing me? You don't think it would be a conflict of interest since we're friends? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I appreciate your concern, but as a professional, I always maintain strict boundaries with my clients. I believe I could provide you with the support you need without any conflicts.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B:  I understand your concern about a conflict of interest, but as a therapist, I have strict professional boundaries and confidentiality rules that I follow. If you feel comfortable talking to me, I would be more than happy to help you work through any issues you may have. Plus, it's always good to have a friend like you in therapy, someone who knows me outside of my practice.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "As both responses acknowledge the concern of conflict of interest and mention maintaining professional boundaries, neither response contradicts any past memories. Both responses maintain consistency with Speaker B's role as a therapist offering professional help. Therefore, no choice is clearly better in terms of consistency.\n\nChoice: tie"
