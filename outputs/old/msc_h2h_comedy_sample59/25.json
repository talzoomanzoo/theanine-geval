    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I've tried a Beyond Burger before, and I have to admit, it was surprisingly close to the real thing!\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A:  I'm glad to hear you're planning to continue working in the lab! I have no doubt you'll be able to balance classes and your job. And thank you for the offer to try a Beyond burger or plant-based version, I would definitely be willing to give that a try. It's important to explore all options, especially when it comes to food and sustainability.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Based on the conversation, Speaker A is not being offered to try a Beyond burger. Speaker B was discussing if Speaker A would be willing to eat a plant-based burger. Therefore, saying \"thank you for the offer\" in response 2 is inconsistent with the current conversation as no offer was made. Response 1 does not contradict any part of the conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
