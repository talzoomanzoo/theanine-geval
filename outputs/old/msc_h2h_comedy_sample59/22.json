That's really exciting! \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Definitely! I'm looking forward to seeing how the cloning process unfolds.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B:  I'm definitely excited to see the outcome of the cloning project in the lab! It's amazing how far science has come. I'll have to make sure to celebrate with a burger after a run while listening to some music, it really helps me relax after a long day.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Without past memories, both responses are consistent regarding the plan to continue working in the lab during the cow cloning process. However, Response 2 introduces additional elements like celebrating with a burger after a run and listening to music, which may or may not align with past memories, making it potentially less consistent if there were relevant past details omitted. With limited information available, there is no direct contradiction in either response, but Response 1 remains more straightforward and focused on the topic.\nChoice: 1"
