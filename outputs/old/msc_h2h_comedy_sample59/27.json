That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal.\nSpeaker B: That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab! \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: That's fascinating! I had no idea that bananas, avocados, and bees could clone themselves. Nature is truly remarkable.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A:  That's really interesting to know about cloning in nature! I had no idea bananas and avocados could clone themselves. It's cool that you're planning to major in molecular biology, it seems like a perfect fit for you. And I'm definitely looking forward to trying your chili dog casserole at the diner!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nThe provided past memories do not contain any information regarding Speaker B's plans to major in molecular biology or about a dish called \"chili dog casserole,\" so incorporating these elements in the conversation would introduce contradictions by adding false details. Response 1 maintains consistency by not introducing additional details that were never mentioned, while Response 2 introduces inconsistencies with previously unrelated information. \n\nChoice: 1"
