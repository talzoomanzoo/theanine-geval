    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I'll definitely let you know how it goes. It's going to be a fantastic experience for sure.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A:  I'm really looking forward to our meetup this weekend. I may not be the best swimmer, but I'm excited to learn. And thanks for offering to teach me. Maybe after our swimming and programming lessons, we can grab some pizzaburgers together. I could use a stress-reliever after all the swimming practice!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The criterion is consistency, which means the response should not introduce information that contradicts what is stated or implied in the previous conversation. Response 1 maintains consistency by focusing on the future experience of going to the Caribbean, aligning with Speaker B's interest in hearing about it. Response 2 introduces inconsistencies by having Speaker A mention they are not the best swimmer, while earlier inferring that they are experienced enough to teach swimming. Additionally, it suggests Speaker A would be the one learning, which contradicts the teaching role established.\n\nChoice: 1"
