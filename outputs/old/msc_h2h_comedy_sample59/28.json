That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal.\nSpeaker B: That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab!\nSpeaker A: Oh! I did not know that. Well if you can clone cows that's more ice cream for you! Haha. What's your favorite ice cream flavor? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I love mint chocolate chip ice cream! It's so refreshing and has just the right amount of sweetness. What about you, what's your favorite flavor?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B:  My favorite ice cream flavor is definitely cookies and cream! I love the combination of the creamy vanilla base with the crunchy cookie pieces mixed in. It's the perfect treat after a long day at the lab. What about you, what's your go-to ice cream flavor?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: There is no past memory provided to verify the consistency of either response. Therefore, neither response contradicts any provided information from past memories or the current conversation.\n\nChoice: tie"
