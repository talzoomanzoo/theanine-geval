    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim.  \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: Don't worry, I'll teach you step by step. It's going to be a great weekend!\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: Response: Don't worry, we can take it slow with the swimming lessons. I'm sure you'll pick it up in no time! And after all the swimming, we can grab some pizzaburgers to refuel. It's going to be a great weekend!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are consistent as they do not contradict the past memories and align with the current conversation where Speaker A plans to teach Speaker B how to swim, which Speaker B is concerned about. There are no past memories provided which could create contradictions with either response, therefore both responses adhere to the consistency criterion equally.\nChoice: tie"
