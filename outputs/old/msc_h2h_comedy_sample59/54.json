Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\nSpeaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient! \nSpeaker A: Wow, that gives me a completely different perspective. You'd really be ok with seeing me? You don't think it would be a conflict of interest since we're friends?\nSpeaker B: No not at all but if you didn't feel comfortable talking to me I can recommend a couple of my colleagues who are just as brilliant\nSpeaker A: I'd prefer to see you since I'm already comfortable talking to you! It will get the awkward part out of the way for me! \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: That's great to hear! I'm glad you feel comfortable with me. We can definitely work on addressing those unresolved childhood traumas together.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B:  I would be more than happy to see you, Speaker A. It's great that you already feel comfortable talking to me, that can make the therapy process much easier. And don't worry about it being a conflict of interest, I can assure you that I will maintain a professional relationship with you. Let's work together to address any unresolved childhood trauma and help you find some peace of mind.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nThe two responses need to be evaluated for consistency based on the details provided in the current conversation. Both responses acknowledge Speaker A's willingness to enter therapy with Speaker B due to the existing comfort level. Neither of them contains information that contradicts the conversation or any past memories since no specific past memories were provided. Both responses align with the conversation's flow regarding unresolved childhood trauma and the assurance of professional conduct. Thus, they maintain consistency.\n\nChoice: tie"
