How's the planning going so far?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: Response:  I've been thinking about taking on a second part-time job to save up for my trip to Sweden to visit my cousin. I know it's going to be worth it to experience all the local music and coffee shops there. Maybe we can even check out some jamband music or classic reggae while I'm there!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The current conversation does not provide any context about Speaker B's involvement in the trip planning or their personal plans related to it, such as taking a part-time job or having a cousin in Sweden. Response 2 introduces these elements without any support from past memories, which may contradict the current conversation context. Response 1 is more consistent as it stays in line with the provided conversation and does not introduce new elements that could potentially contradict past memories.\n\nChoice: 1"
