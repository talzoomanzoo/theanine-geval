Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\nSpeaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing? \nSpeaker B: He's doing well! He just finished theatre camp and he's fighting with my sister because he wants to dye his hair green hahaha. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: Sounds like he's taking after your adventurous side with that hair color choice! Have you ever considered trying a bold color like that?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A:  That's hilarious about your nephew wanting to dye his hair green! Reminds me of when I was his age and wanted to dye my hair all sorts of crazy colors. Speaking of hair dye, I recently tried out a new semi-permanent shade and it turned out great! Maybe you should give it a try with your grandkids, they might have a blast helping you pick out a fun color!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The current conversation does not make any mention of Speaker A having grandkids or a history of dying their hair crazy colors as a child. Response 2 introduces the idea that Speaker A has grandkids and that they wanted to dye their hair crazy colors as a child, which is not corroborated by the conversation. Therefore, Response 2 could contradict previous experiences not shared in the current conversation. On the other hand, Response 1 stays on topic and hypothetical about Speaker B's personality without adding contradictory information.\n\nChoice: 1"
