    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\nSpeaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car?\nSpeaker B: Yes, there are several. Hope we could meet and You possibly teach me about computer programming.\nSpeaker A: That would be great too. I like to program in several different languages. Do you have a preference?\nSpeaker B: No, I'm just getting started so I don't have a preference. Maybe you could show me what you prefer and we could start there. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: Perfect, we can start with Python, it's a great language to begin with. I'll show you the basics.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: Response: That sounds like a great plan! I can definitely show you some programming languages that I prefer and we can start learning together. Maybe we can grab some pizzaburgers after our lesson, it's my favorite stress-relief food too. And don't worry, we can take it slow with the swimming lessons. I'll make sure you feel comfortable in the pool before we start.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The criterion of consistency requires that the response should not contain information that contradicts any known facts from the conversation or previous memories. In the given conversation, there is no mention of \"pizzaburgers\" being mentioned as speaker A's favorite stress-relief food, or any details about stress-relief food at all. This makes the introduction of this detail in Response 2 inconsistent with the conversation. On the other hand, Response 1 sticks to the topic of programming languages, which is directly relevant to the conversation where Speaker B is interested in learning programming and has no preference, making it consistent with the flow of conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
