    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: Definitely, I'd be curious to try it! It would be interesting to see if there's any difference in taste.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: Response: I really hope I can continue working in the lab even when classes get tough. I'm really excited about the cloning project! And yeah, I would totally eat a hamburger from a cloned cow. It's all about advancing science and innovation, right? Plus, I bet it would taste just as delicious as the ones I make at the diner!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The responses should only be judged based on their consistency with the current conversation since no past memories were provided. RESPONSE 2 introduces new information that could potentially relate to past memories which don't exist here (such as Speaker A working at a diner), and talks about wanting to continue the work in the lab, which seems like a mix-up with Speaker B's desires. Thus, RESPONSE 2 provides unnecessary and potentially inconsistent information. RESPONSE 1 is consistent with the current conversation as it directly answers Speaker B's question about eating a hamburger from a cloned cow.\n\nChoice: 1"
