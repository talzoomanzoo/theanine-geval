    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun! \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: That sounds awesome! I can't wait to listen to it while we hang out by the pool and then get into our programming studies.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: Response: That sounds like a great playlist! I'm excited for our meetup this weekend. I can't wait to try out the fun music by the pool and dive into our programming studies with some steady tunes. And of course, pizza burgers are always a good idea. Looking forward to our swimming lessons too - maybe one day we'll be cruising in the Caribbean together!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nSince there are no past memories provided to verify or contradict the information in the responses, consistency will be judged based on the current conversation alone. Response 1 stays strictly within the context of the planned activities (hanging out by the pool and programming studies) and does not introduce new elements. Response 2, on the other hand, introduces additional elements like pizza burgers, swimming lessons, and cruising in the Caribbean, which were not mentioned in the current conversation. Without past memories to verify the relevance or contradiction of these new elements, Response 2 is potentially inconsistent with the information provided in the conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
