    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\n\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden?\nSpeaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends.\nSpeaker A: That sounds nice! So how is your job going?\nSpeaker B: Always interesting, that's for sure! I have been training to nurse on a new floor, so that'll give me a change of scenery.\nSpeaker A: Does that add a lot of extra work to your plate? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: It definitely keeps me on my toes, but I'm excited for the new challenge.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B:  My job is definitely keeping me busy, but I'm excited for the change of scenery with the new floor. It's always good to keep things interesting, right? And hey, maybe the extra income from your second job will help you save up even faster for your trip to Sweden!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "However, with the given context and information, the choice would be based on the consistency of the responses with the current conversation.\n\nExplanation: \nResponse 1 is consistent with the current conversation. Speaker B is excited for the change, which ties in with the idea of extra work on a new floor, a context that has been discussed. \n\nResponse 2, while consistent with the current conversation initially, introduces new information about Speaker A having a second job which is not mentioned anywhere in the dialogue or past memories provided. This inconsistency makes Response 2 less aligned with the criterion, as it contains unsupported assumptions about Speaker A.\n\nChoice: 1"
