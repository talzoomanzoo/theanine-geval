Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\nSpeaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\nSpeaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\nSpeaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.\nSpeaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Movie blood is typically made of a mixture of ingredients like corn syrup, food coloring, and sometimes a thickening agent like cornstarch. It needs to look realistic on camera but also be safe for the actors.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: Movie blood is typically made from a mixture of ingredients like corn syrup, food coloring, and sometimes even chocolate syrup or coffee grounds for texture. My favorite recipe involves using corn syrup as a base with red and blue food coloring to achieve a realistic look. It's pretty fun experimenting with different combinations to get the perfect consistency and color for each scene.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",

There are no contradictions with past memories in either response since Speaker B is knowledgeable about horror movie production, and discussing blood recipes is relevant to their experience.\n\nChoice: tie"
