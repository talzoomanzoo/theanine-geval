    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nSpeaker A is a high school student planning to go to college, achieving straight A's.\nSpeaker B is also a high school student preparing for college, working at a diner at night.\nSpeaker A enjoys running and listening to music as hobbies.\nSpeaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\nSpeaker A's parents are blue-collar workers, not supporting their education.\nSpeaker B lives alone with a deaf dog and finds inspiration in neuroscience.\nSpeaker A's dad is a steel worker, emphasizing the value of hard work in life.\nSpeaker B has a deaf dog named Sparky, a beagle breed.\nSpeaker A is interested in getting a dog and had a hamster named Leonardo in the past.\nSpeaker A suggests getting a border collie breed for running and exercise.\nSpeaker B had another dog named Paco when they were younger.\nSpeaker A offers to take Sparky for a walk to help out and spend time with the dog.\nSpeaker B is busy and appreciates the offer to help with Sparky.\nSpeaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner.\nSpeaker A is considering getting a dog and already walks Speaker B's dog, Sparky.\nSpeaker B's dog is deaf and needs to be kept on a lead due to recall difficulties.\nSpeaker A and Speaker B discuss the challenges and rewards of having a dog with hearing issues.\nSpeaker B's dog is very loving and attentive, possibly because of the deafness.\nSpeaker A and Speaker B agree on the unconditional love and attention dogs provide.\nSpeaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\nSpeaker A had cheesy ham and potato soup for dinner.\nSpeaker A is a freshman in school, trying to finish in 3 years.\nSpeaker B is close to finishing school with just two more weeks left.\nSpeaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\nSpeaker B is considering giving up their night job to focus on lab work and school.\nSpeaker A recommends taking summer classes to get ahead and make friends with classmates.\nSpeaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\nSpeaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: Definitely, I'd be curious to try it! It would be interesting to see if there's any difference in taste.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A:  I really hope I can continue working in the lab even when classes get tough. I'm really excited about the cloning project! And yeah, I would totally eat a hamburger from a cloned cow. It's all about advancing science and innovation, right? Plus, I bet it would taste just as delicious as the ones I make at the diner!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses address the topic of eating a hamburger from a cloned cow, but Response 2 contains information that is inconsistent with the past memories. Speaker A does not work in a lab, nor have they mentioned being involved in the cloning project, which Speaker B has been associated with. Additionally, Speaker A is not known to make hamburgers at a diner, as that aligns with Speaker B's job. This makes Response 2 inconsistent with the past memories. Response 1, however, is straightforward and does not imply any involvement in Speaker B's activities, making it consistent with the past information.\n\nChoice: 1"
