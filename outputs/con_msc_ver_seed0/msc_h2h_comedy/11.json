    "prediction": "Explanation: \nBoth responses are generally consistent with the past memories as they relate to interests and activities of the speakers. Response 1 is straightforward and expresses Speaker B's interest in learning to surf, aligning with past memories that Speaker B is interested in surfing. Response 2 not only addresses Speaker B's interest in surfing but also links back to current and past conversations about learning instruments, maintaining consistency with the idea that it's about having the right teacher and time to practice. However, the statement about teaching drums doesn't clearly align with Speaker B's character of not knowing how to play an instrument, which could lead to some inconsistency.\n\nChoice: 1"
