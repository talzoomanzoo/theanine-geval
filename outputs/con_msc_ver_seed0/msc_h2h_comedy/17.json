My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: You should check the daylight hours in Alaska, especially if you're planning on doing activities like sledding with dogs.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A:  I did some research and found out that Alaska experiences the Midnight Sun phenomenon during the summer months, where it stays daylight for almost 24 hours! So, I guess I can go sledding with dogs at any time of the day. Thanks for the suggestion, I can't wait for this adventure!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 is consistent with the past memories as it suggests checking the daylight hours in Alaska, which aligns with the uncertainty shared by Speaker B about the current daylight situation in Alaska. Response 2, on the other hand, incorrectly states that Speaker A personally conducted research without any prior discussion or mention of such an activity, and it also assumes that dog sledding is possible at any time of the day, contradicting the note that Speaker B is unsure about the daylight situation. Additionally, the implication that Speaker A will be going sledding contradicts Speaker B planning the trip with friends, not Speaker A. Response 1 aligns better given the criterion of consistency.\n\nChoice: 1"
