Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \nSpeaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!). \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: That's awesome to hear! Your passion for motivating others really shines through. I'll definitely keep you in mind for motivating my friend to start running again.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: That's fantastic to hear! Your passion for motivating others really shines through. With your enthusiasm and energy, I have no doubt you would make an excellent motivational speaker for my friend. Let's set up a meeting to discuss the details and get them back on track with their running goals.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are largely consistent with the memories, as they involve Speaker B's job as a motivational speaker. However, Response 2 contains an implied contradiction. Speaker B is already a motivational speaker and has applied to help motivate Speaker A's friend, so setting up a meeting to discuss Speaker B becoming a motivational speaker for the friend seems unnecessary. Therefore, Response 1 is more consistent because it acknowledges Speaker B's current role as a motivational speaker without implying the unnecessary step of discussing their qualifications for the role.\n\nChoice: 1"
