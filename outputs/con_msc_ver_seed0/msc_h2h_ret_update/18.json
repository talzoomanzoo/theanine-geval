My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do.\nSpeaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: That sounds like a great idea! Camping under the stars in Alaska would be an incredible experience.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: That sounds amazing! Camping under the Alaskan night sky must be a breathtaking experience. We could even try to catch the northern lights if we're lucky. I'll have to look into the best spots for stargazing in Alaska.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses prevent any inconsistency as they focus on the possibility of camping under the Alaskan night sky. However, response 2 includes additional information about the possibility of seeing the northern lights, which is commonly associated with long periods of darkness near the Arctic circle and hence is consistent with their discussion about daylight and darkness in Alaska. There are no contradictions with past memories concerning the activities and environment in Alaska. Both choices are consistent, but response 2 adds more relevant detail about stargazing which may imply knowledge in line with considering Alaska's unique daylight patterns.\n\nChoice: 2"
