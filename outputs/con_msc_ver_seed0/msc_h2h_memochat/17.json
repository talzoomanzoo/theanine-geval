    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 is consistent with the past memories because it aligns with Speaker B's current intention to check the daylight hours in Alaska due to the uncertainty about the time of day. It doesn't introduce any conflicting information. Response 2 introduces the concept of the midnight sun and suggests that sledding is possible during this time, which conflicts with the current memory of Speaker A being unsure about the current daylight conditions in Alaska. \n\nChoice: 1"
