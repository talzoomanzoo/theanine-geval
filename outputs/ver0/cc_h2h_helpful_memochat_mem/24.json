    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 2 is more directly relevant to the dialogue context. It touches on Neighbor A's feeling of being overwhelmed and the related conversation history where Neighbor B offers support. This aligns well with the current point in the dialogue where Neighbor A mentions feeling overwhelmed. Memory 1, while it contains some relevant information about being overwhelmed, includes extraneous details about a book and Neighbor A's general feelings about their impact at work, which do not directly support a helpful response to the current dialogue topic.\n\nChoice: 2"
