This is directly relevant to Classmates B's question about whether Classmates A has moved on from past struggles with school and friendships. This MEMORY allows Classmates B to provide a more empathetic and informed response. On the other hand, MEMORY 1 contains information about social activities and personality traits but does not directly relate to the question about past struggles.\n\nChoice: 2"
