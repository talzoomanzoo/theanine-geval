    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is about co-worker A feeling grateful for a supportive boss and how it motivates them. Then, co-worker B refers to a past time when co-worker A was feeling frustrated while working on a movie set. Memory 1 is more directly relevant because it references co-worker A and B's collaboration on a movie and their mutual respect, which aligns with the mention of a past movie project and co-worker A's feelings during that time. Memory 2, on the other hand, delves into unrelated topics such as fears and frustrations unrelated to the supportive boss or the specific movie setting context.\n\nChoice: 1"
