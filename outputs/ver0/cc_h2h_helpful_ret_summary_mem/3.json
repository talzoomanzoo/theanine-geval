    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Co-workers B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nCo-worker B showed a willingness to assist others by helping a customer resolve an issue last week. This demonstrates Co-worker B's supportive nature and readiness to help in any way. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it, similar to when they spoke with the police about an incident where the women involved were thankful. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time. \nCo-worker B commended Co-worker A for their bravery and willingness to help, leading Co-worker A to try to stay positive and focus on their recovery despite it being a daunting task. Co-worker B admires Co-worker A's resilience and positivity, describing them as someone who can stay optimistic even in challenging situations, such as the accident where they lost their hands and feet.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\n2. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\n3. Co-worker B admires Co-worker A's resilience and positivity.\n4. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's positivity and friendship.\n5. Co-worker B is supportive and willing to help in any way.\n6. Co-worker B commended Co-worker A for their bravery and willingness to help.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more helpful because it includes all the relevant interactions needed for Co-worker B's response. It recalls the incident with the borrowed pencil and Co-worker B's supportive reaction, which directly relates to Co-worker A's current improper plan to act without consent. By focusing on Co-worker B's supportive nature and previous advice about making amends, it allows Co-worker B to respond effectively with guidance towards making better relationship decisions. MEMORY 1 contains similar information but adds unnecessary details about an incident with the police and an accident, which are not relevant to the context of a consent-related discussion and thus could distract from the current situation.\n\nChoice: 2"
