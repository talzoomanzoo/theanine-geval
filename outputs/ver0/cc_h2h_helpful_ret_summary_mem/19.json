    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm sorry you had to hear me swear like that. I shouldn't have lost my temper like that.\nNeighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset?\nNeighbors A: It was just something that happened at work. My boss was being unreasonable and I couldn't take it anymore.\nNeighbors B: That's understandable. Have you tried talking to your boss about it?\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I have, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I just feel like I'm stuck in a dead-end job.\nNeighbors B: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you considered looking for a new job?\nNeighbors A: I have, but with the current job market, it's really tough. Plus, I don't have a lot of experience in other fields.\nNeighbors B: Well, I'll keep an ear out for any job openings that might be a good fit for you. In the meantime, maybe try finding ways to de-stress after work? I find that exercise helps me when I'm feeling frustrated. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbor A mentioned the importance of keeping outside spaces clean and maintained for the future. This aligns with the mutual support Neighbors A and B show each other, as seen when Neighbors A helped with their lawn. Additionally, Neighbors A values appreciation and expresses gratitude for help received, highlighting the supportive and helpful dynamic between them.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbors B is supportive and understanding of Neighbors A's mistake.\n2. Neighbors A and B live in the same neighborhood and help each other with tasks.\n3. Neighbors A values appreciation and expresses gratitude for help received.\n4. Neighbors A and B are helpful towards each other.\n5. Neighbors B recalls when Neighbors A helped with their lawn, showing mutual support between them.\n6. Neighbors A and B have a positive and helpful relationship as neighbors.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 focuses primarily on maintaining outside spaces and the supportive dynamic based on previous actions such as lawn help. It includes specific information that highlights the supportive nature of their relationship. MEMORY 2, however, provides a broader view of the relationship, emphasizing general support, understanding, and mutual help, which directly relates to the ongoing conversation about dealing with a tough job situation and finding ways to destress. This makes MEMORY 2 more useful and relevant for the current topic of support and advice.\n\nChoice: 2"
