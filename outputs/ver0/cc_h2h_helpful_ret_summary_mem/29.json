    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Co-workers A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message.\nCo-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of skills, you always present a compelling argument in debates. I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument. This experience has led to Co-worker A presenting evidence in front of a judge to support their position in the past, where they denied that their reputation had any impact on Karen giving them the money.\n   \n2. Co-worker A plans to present the evidence clearly and persuasively in court, which has already changed to Co-worker A having presented evidence in front of a judge to support their position in the past. In that instance, Co-worker A denied that their reputation had any impact on Karen giving them the money.\n   \n3. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument. This has led Co-worker B to commend Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs, resulting in Co-worker A being willing to take on the project of building a deck for Co-worker B.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker A plans to present the evidence clearly and persuasively in court.\n2. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument.\n3. Co-worker A has presented evidence in front of a judge to support their position in the past.\n4. Co-worker B commends Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs.\n5. Co-worker A's evidence includes statistics and personal accounts from clients.\n6. Co-worker B is supportive and interested in the evidence collected by Co-worker A.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides concise and relevant details that align well with the dialogue context, particularly the mention of Co-worker A's ability to present persuasive arguments. It includes points such as Co-worker A's history of presenting evidence in court and the type of evidence they use, which is relevant to the discussion about their persuasion skills. Additionally, MEMORY 2 indicates Co-worker B's supportive role, which ties into the positive feedback Co-worker A is receiving in the dialogue. MEMORY 1, however, contains unnecessary details about an unrelated situation involving Karen and less cohesively connects to the dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 2"
