    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context involves Co-worker B mentioning a previous instance where Co-worker A surprised them with their skills, specifically in uncovering a mystery. The relevant part of the memory needed is about Co-worker A's skills in solving mysteries and the surprise element, which directly connects to the dialogue. Memory 1 highlights Co-worker A's talent for solving puzzles and mysteries, which is directly relevant to the context of Co-worker B's comment about having surprised people with their skills before. It emphasizes Co-worker A's 'Sherlock Holmes-like skills' and their enjoyment in solving puzzles, which aligns well with Co-worker B's reminiscence about being surprised. Memory 2 contains similar information but has additional details that are not directly relevant to the specific dialogue context, such as Co-worker A finding out about Co-worker B's marriage and other extraneous points. Since both memories contain the relevant useful information for this context, but Memory 2 includes more unnecessary details, Memory 1 is more concise and focused on what's needed. Therefore, Memory 1 is more helpful for the response.\n\nChoice: 1"
