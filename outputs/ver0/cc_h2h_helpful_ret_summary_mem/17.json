    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just tried this breathing exercise and it really helped me relax.\nNeighbors B: What kind of breathing exercise?\nNeighbors A: It's just a simple one, where you inhale for four seconds, hold your breath for seven seconds, and then exhale for eight seconds. I've been doing it every day for the past week and it's made such a difference.\nNeighbors B: That's really interesting. I've heard that breathing exercises can be really helpful for reducing stress and anxiety.\nNeighbors A: Yes, it definitely has helped me with that. Plus, it's something that I can easily do anywhere, whether I'm at home or out running errands.\nNeighbors B: That's great. It's always good to have a simple tool like that to help manage stress. \nNeighbors A: Speaking of managing stress, remember a few years ago when I pushed your shoulder because I wanted you to accept me?\nNeighbors B: Oh yeah, I do remember that. That was a stressful time for both of us.\nNeighbors A: It definitely was. But I'm so glad that we've been able to move past that and have a good neighborly relationship now.\nNeighbors B: Me too. And remember when you found that great park a few years ago? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbors A showed appreciation for Neighbors B's actions in the neighborhood, leading to Neighbors A being willing to take things slow in their relationship with Neighbors B. This resulted in Neighbors B reassuring Neighbor A about past embarrassing incidents and emphasizing their current friendship. \nNeighbors A ordered a large cheese pizza with extra sauce for Neighbors B, highlighting the value of their friendship. This conversation transitioned to Neighbor A's daughter starting high school, which has been a significant adjustment for the family.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbor B reassures Neighbor A about past embarrassing incidents and emphasizes their current friendship.\n2. Neighbors A did this as a gesture of appreciation for Neighbors B's actions in the neighborhood.\n3. Neighbors B values their friendship with Neighbors A.\n4. Neighbor A and Neighbor B found a park together a couple of years ago and enjoyed playing frisbee and having a picnic.\n5. Neighbors A is willing to take things slow in their relationship with Neighbors B.\n6. Neighbors A has developed romantic feelings for Neighbors B.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The MEMORY that provides relevant information for the conversation is one that focuses on the past events and current relationship between Neighbors A and B. The DIALOGUE CONTEXT discusses past tensions and the subsequent improvement in their neighborly relationship, which aligns with MEMORY 2's points about reassurance and friendship. MEMORY 1 contains additional, unrelated details such as pizza and Neighbor A's daughter, which are not pertinent to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nChoice: 2"
