It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life.\nChild: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you.\nParent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you.\nChild: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations, which causes them to mention making mistakes in the past and trying to turn their life around.\n- The Parent and Child plan to watch the sunrise together in the future, and the parent suggests repeating the sunrise-watching tradition on a future weekend.\n- The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring and is supportive and proud of their parent for making changes, offering help and reassurance if needed.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations.\n2. The child is supportive and caring towards the parent.\n3. The child offers help and reassurance to the parent.\n4. Both the parent and child express love and support for each other.\n5. The child is supportive and proud of their parent for making changes.\n6. The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: In the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, the child asks the parent if they felt unheard while in detention. MEMORY 1 directly addresses the parent's past mistakes and their journey of making positive changes, which can be relevant to the experience of feeling unheard or misunderstood during difficult times. This memory also touches on the child's support and pride in the parent's changes, which further aligns with the theme of listening and support mentioned in the dialogue. In contrast, MEMORY 2, while capturing similar themes, presents them in a more general and less direct manner. The specific reference to the parent's past mistakes in MEMORY 1 makes it more directly helpful in addressing the child's question about detention.\n\nChoice: 1"
