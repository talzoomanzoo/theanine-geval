    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides relevant background about Speaker B's interest in animals and books, which directly relates to the context of the dialogue where Speaker B mentions preferring animal books. Additionally, it mentions the shared interest in movies and TV shows, relevant to Speaker B's question about whether the crime drama book has been made into a movie. MEMORY 1, while providing information about Speaker B's fascination with animals, centers more on Speaker Aâ€™s grandchildren and lacks as much relevance to the current inquiry about a movie adaptation.\n\nChoice: 2"
