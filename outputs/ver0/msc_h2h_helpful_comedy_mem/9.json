    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends?\nSpeaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do.\nSpeaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars.\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I think they go dark for a couple months and then have daylight for a couple months! I actually like night time, but having daylight all the time will make me crazy lol. Yeah I kind of hope it's dark for the camping but it will be very cold. I have heard Alaska has delicious ice cream. I want to try that while I'm there, \nSpeaker A: You'd have to get some serious blackout curtains for when it was daylight lol! You'll have to stock up on some warm essentials before heading out. You definitely don't want to get stuck in a bad situation in the cold, especially if you're alone. I bet they have great ice cream! You'll have to tell me about it when you get back!\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I need to call my friend and find out what season they are in so I can pack accordingly. I will take pictures of the ice cream too so I can tell you about it. I wonder if there are a lot of bears there? I don't like bears either.\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty sure they have grizzlies up there. You better pack something to fend them off too just in case. I bet your friend knows everything you'd need to keep them away.\nSpeaker B: I will bring whatever they let me bring on the airplane, but I am really counting on my friend to help me out with the local customs lol. Do you know if Rocky and Bullwinkle were from Alaska? \nSpeaker A: No, they were from Minnesota. Are you going to have your friend be your hiking guide?\nSpeaker B: I invited my friend to come stay at the lodge where I'm vacationing and he said it would be fun to get away for a bit. So I'm hoping he will show me around for a week or so. I might have to hire a hiking guide, it depends on how much he knows about hiking and grizzlies I think. What do you think?

    "prediction": "Explanation: The helpfulness of the memory in responding to Speaker B's question about whether to hire a hiking guide hinges on the relevance and context of the provided information.
