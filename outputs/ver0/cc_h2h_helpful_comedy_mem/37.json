    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics between Classmates A and B. It emphasizes mutual support, trust, and emotional connection, which align directly with the current conversation about their feelings and concerns about taking their friendship further. This memory contains sufficient background on their relationship, the support they have shown each other, and helps contextualize the courage both feel in discussing their feelings. MEMORY 1, while also touching on support and trust, is more focused on specific events rather than the overall relationship dynamics, and may not be as directly helpful in responding to the current dialogue.\n\nChoice: 2"
