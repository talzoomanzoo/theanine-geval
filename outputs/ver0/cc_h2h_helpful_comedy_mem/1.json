    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 primarily focuses on the Mentor providing support during different situations such as college applications and job decisions. Although it mentions the Mentor's reassurance to the Mentee, it is less specific to addressing feelings of loneliness. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, highlights the close and supportive relationship between the Mentor and Mentee, and it suggests the Mentor's awareness of Mentee's personal growth and challenges, such as taking a job in the city, which may relate to their current feeling of loneliness. Hence, MEMORY 2 is more useful and relevant to the context of the Mentee feeling lonely in a new city.\n\nChoice: 2"
