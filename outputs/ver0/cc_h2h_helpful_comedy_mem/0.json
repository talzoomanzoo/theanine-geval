    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Parent to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life.\nChild: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you.\nParent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you.\nChild: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations, which causes them to mention making mistakes in the past and trying to turn their life around.\n- The Parent and Child plan to watch the sunrise together in the future, and the parent suggests repeating the sunrise-watching tradition on a future weekend.\n- The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring and is supportive and proud of their parent for making changes, offering help and reassurance if needed.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description: \nThe user, Child, is a caring and empathetic individual who is supportive of their parent, Parent. Child shows love and concern for Parent, even in difficult situations. Child enjoys spending time with Parent and values their relationship. \n\nRelationship Description:\nThe relationship between Child and Parent is strong and loving. Child expresses their love and support for Parent, offering help and comfort during challenging times. Parent appreciates Child's kindness and understanding, showing gratitude for their presence and support.\n\nEvent Description:\nChild empathized with Parent's situation when Parent was taken to juvenile detention. Despite the difficult circumstances, Parent and Child found hope in small moments, like watching the sunrise together. Parent emphasized the importance of finding beauty in life, even during tough times. Child's suggestion of watching the sunrise together showed their desire to support and spend quality time with Parent. Overall, the events shared by Child and Parent highlight their strong bond and mutual care for each other.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains specific information about past situations, such as mistakes and plans to watch the sunrise, which directly relate to the context of remembering difficult times and finding support and inspiration from the Child. However, it does not explicitly mention the situation in detention. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, directly references the detention experience and how both the Parent and Child found hope in small moments, specifically tying back to the context where detention is mentioned. This makes MEMORY 2 more relevant and helpful for addressing the Child's current query about detention and feeling listened to.\n\nChoice: 2"
