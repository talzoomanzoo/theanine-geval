    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B, who does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies, wants Speaker A to teach them how to swim and programming. Speaker B also enjoys cruising in their car while listening to punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming. On the other hand, Speaker A, who enjoys cruising and has a favorite club in school, causes Speaker A to plan snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination. This leads to Speaker A and Speaker B discussing the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n2. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n3. Speaker A has planned to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n5. Speaker A is planning a snorkeling trip and has signed up for several trips.\n6. Speaker B is afraid of cruises because they can't swim.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides a context that directly connects to the dialogue. It contains necessary and relevant information about Speaker B's interest in learning to swim, mentioning the specific scenario where they discuss getting on a cruise ship, which is directly relevant to the last utterance. MEMORY 2 introduces unrelated details, such as programming, and creates some inconsistency as it suggests Speaker B is afraid of cruises, which contradicts the dialogue where Speaker B expresses interest in joining a cruise.\n\nChoice: 1"
