    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read.\nSpeaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting? \nSpeaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far.\nSpeaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes. \nSpeaker A: why don't you like books like that?\nSpeaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B's fascination with animals allows them to understand Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals. This is because Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves with technology or watching TV. Additionally, Speaker A enjoys watching movies with their grandchildren. Speaker B, on the other hand, has a young son and finds solace in reading books, especially those about animals. This interest in animals is shared with Speaker A, who mentions watching movies with their grandchildren.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B has a son and enjoys reading books, particularly about animals.\n2. Speaker B is fascinated by animals and can relate to Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals.\n3. Speaker A has grandchildren and enjoys watching movies with them.\n4. Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix.\n5. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n6. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context shows that Speaker B likes animal books and is looking for information on whether a movie has been made from the book Speaker A is currently reading. Both MEMORIES mention Speaker B's preference for animal-themed content, which is consistent with Speaker B's statement in the dialogue. However, MEMORY 1 includes additional unnecessary comparisons and information that are less relevant to the current conversation topic. MEMORY 2 succinctly provides the information that both Speaker B is interested in animal books and coves multiple relevant points about Speaker A's interests and activities without extraneous details.\n\nChoice: 2"
