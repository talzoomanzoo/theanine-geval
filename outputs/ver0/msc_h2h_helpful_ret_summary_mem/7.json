    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\nSpeaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call!\nSpeaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip?  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A is a librarian and loves kids, mentioning having 3 children. This makes Speaker A busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. Consequently, Speaker B, who has a lot of kids all grown up with kids of their own, enjoys spending time with their grandkids at the park. This led Speaker B to take their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n2.

Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n6.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides a more cohesive and relevant background about both Speaker A and Speaker B. It highlights the shared experiences and perspectives of the two speakers regarding family and time management, which aligns with the conversation topic. The context about Speaker B wanting to make the fishing trip an annual tradition ties into the question posed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. MEMORY 2 contains unnecessary details like the grandkids' interest in phones and tablets, which do not directly relate to the topic of the proposed fishing trip.\n\nChoice: 1"
