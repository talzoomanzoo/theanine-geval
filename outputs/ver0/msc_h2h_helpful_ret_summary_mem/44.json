    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \nSpeaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!).\nSpeaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol\nSpeaker B: I am up for the challenge! I have a few tricks up my sleeve to deal with people like you.\nSpeaker A: Oh geez that makes me sound difficult.lol  Do you have any new speeches coming up?\nSpeaker B: Nope, I just cleared my schedule until the Alps marathon that you're training for. It's just you and me until you break that finish line. I'm going to start sending you a motivational quote every morning at 4 am when I want you to wake up. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B has run a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding. This experience led Speaker A to seek advice on how to recover from marathon training. Speaker A then invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and planning to meet at the beach at 0600. Speaker B got into motivational speaking because they needed it themselves to battle depression and anxiety, which was suggested by Speaker A to combine with something more active to avoid dwelling on negative thoughts. Speaker B, who travels frequently for work and misses their wife and kids, also finds solace in fishing and the outdoors, similar to their background in San Francisco.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600.\n2. Speaker B has run a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding.\n3. Speaker A is training for marathons and seeking advice on how to recover.\n4. Speaker B is a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks.\n5. Speaker A is a runner who is working on improving their mile time and training for a marathon.\n6. Speaker B's job involves motivating people to be successful and follow their dreams.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context revolves around Speaker A considering asking Speaker B to be their motivational speaker and potentially working together towards Speaker A's marathon goal. The MEMORY should contain relevant information to support this narrative and support the decision-making of both speakers. \n\nMEMORY 1 provides more background on Speaker B's personal motivations and emotional context, which is less pertinent to the immediate conversation about the Alps marathon tactics and motivation plans. MEMORY 2 is more directly relevant, providing concrete details about Speaker A's and Speaker B's marathon experiences and motivations, and directly aligns with the current conversation topics of training and motivation.\n\nChoice: 2"
