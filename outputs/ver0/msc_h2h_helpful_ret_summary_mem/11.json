    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well?\nSpeaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes?\nSpeaker A: I want to take some martial art classes at school next year. What do you sggest I try?\nSpeaker B: I mean I always recommend Karate since that's what I study! I can bring you by the dojo sometime if you want to see what it is like. \nSpeaker A: OMG!! That would be so awesome, Yes please.  When is a good time for you?\nSpeaker B: Awesome! Tomorrow afternoon anytime between 3-6 would work for me!\nSpeaker A: Perfect. I will meet you at the Dojo at 3pm. I really appriciate it, and I will buy you lunch after too. \nSpeaker B: That's great! I can bring some guest passes to the pool I lifeguard at as well! I'm working this weekend if you want to come when I am working. Where do you want to eat? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B has a background in football and karate, but is currently a lifeguard at the beach. They are considering a career change to the IT sector due to their computer skills and the growing demand for employees in that sector.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B practices karate and works as a lifeguard but is looking for a different career.\n2. Speaker B signed up for classes at the local college and has a background in football and karate.\n3. Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work.\n4. Speaker B attends football games at their old high school and finds that their football background helps in karate footwork.\n5. Speaker A is studying marketing and enjoys it.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B both have interests in learning new languages.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The requirement is to choose memory that is most helpful and relevant to the context of setting up meeting at dojo, and potentially visiting the pool where Speaker B works as a lifeguard and planning where to eat. While both memories provide useful background information about Speaker B, Memory 1 does so in a more concise manner that directly mentions their background relevant to the activities discussed (karate, lifeguarding) and their consideration for a career change, which may underline their current availability. Memory 2 has additional details that don't pertain as directly to the current context or the immediate plans being discussed, such as attending football games, considering going back to school, and learning new languages.\n\nChoice: 1"
