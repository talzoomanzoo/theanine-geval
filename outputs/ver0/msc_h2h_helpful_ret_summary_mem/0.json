It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\nSpeaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing?  \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker A mentions having eight grandchildren and already having blue hair. Speaker B has an oldest nephew who is about to turn 14.\n2. Both Speaker A's mother and Speaker A were librarians, but Speaker A is retired. Speaker B asks if the recommended book is fiction or nonfiction.\n3. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one. Speaker A, a retired librarian, recommends the book \"Beautiful Ruins\" by Jess Walter for a beach visit.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n2. Speaker B has an oldest nephew who is about to turn 14.\n3. Speaker B asks if the recommended book is fiction or nonfiction.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation.\n5. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n6. Both Speaker A's mother and Speaker A were librarians, but Speaker A is retired.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context ends with Speaker A asking about Speaker B's nephew. Memory 1 provides explicit information about Speaker B's nephew, specifying that he is about to turn 14, which is directly relevant to Speaker A's last question. Memory 2 also mentions the nephew but includes unnecessary information for the current context, such as the humor in their conversation and that Speaker B has not started packing yet, which are not as relevant or needed for answering about the nephew. \n\nChoice: 1"
