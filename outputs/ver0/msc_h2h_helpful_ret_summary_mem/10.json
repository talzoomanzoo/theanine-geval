    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok? \nSpeaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish?\nSpeaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus!\nSpeaker B: Oh that sounds absolutely fabulous. Are you going to get a free dessert, as well? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The primary focus of the conversation is on Speaker A's ability to enjoy meals at the restaurant where they work, including potentially trying new items like the Chicken parmesan. MEMORY 2 contains information that directly mentions the free meals Speaker A gets per week and could be relevant when discussing the availability of free desserts as Speaker B inquires. MEMORY 2 also includes relevant context about the restaurant setting and Speaker A's enjoyment of working there, which aligns well with their positive attitude in the dialogue. However, MEMORY 1, although it begins similarly, includes an irrelevant detail about a fire incident and incomplete context compared to MEMORY 2, which could distract from the conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
