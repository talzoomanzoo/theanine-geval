Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make?\nSpeaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days.

You should come over and try it.\nSpeaker A: I would love to, I enjoy cooking so maybe you can teach me to make it, too? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe because Speaker B's grandmother was the matriarch of the family, known for cooking large meals for family gatherings. \nSpeaker A likes cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally as a change from preferring surfing and growing up in a beach town.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 both include information about Speaker B valuing the grandmother's garlic chicken recipe and enjoying cooking for loved ones, which is directly relevant to Speaker A's interest in learning to make it. However, MEMORY 2 includes additional information (points 3 to 6) about Speaker A's activities and preferences that are not directly relevant to the current context of learning to cook spicy dishes or garlic chicken. MEMORY 1 provides a concise background on both speakers that fits the conversation's focus on cooking and shared interests.\n\nChoice: 1"
