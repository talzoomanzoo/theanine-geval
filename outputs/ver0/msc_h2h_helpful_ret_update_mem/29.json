    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company? Do you build computers or work on programming?\nSpeaker B: I do like my job. My job is to troubleshoot issues between the hardware and software, so I get to work with both.\nSpeaker A: That sounds interesting. That's great that you love your job, not many people do.\nSpeaker B: Love is a strong word! I do like it though. There have been jobs I hated and I'm great full not be in that place. Hows you job going?\nSpeaker A: Its going good. Its summer so we are really busy right now. I am just grateful to be back at work. How long have you worked for your company?\nSpeaker B: For about four years. It's an industry in flux which is stressful. I need stability for my family at this point. It has changed my focus, which I'm not used to yet. Are you considering any other options for work? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B's mother is a dentist, and Speaker A expresses interest in speaking to her about it, causing Speaker A to consider becoming a dentist and wanting to talk to Speaker B's mother.\nSpeaker A, who is 27 years old, has been looking at dental programs in colleges and is considering going back to school for dentistry in the future.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B works for a computer company and is unable to change careers until their child graduates.\n2. Speaker A works for a small local business with a demanding schedule.\n3. Speaker A is 27 years old and hopes to change careers soon.\n4. Speaker A is torn between choosing a career in dentistry for the money or working at Disney for happiness.\n5. Speaker A is considering a career in dentistry but is also interested in working at Disney for happiness.\n6. Speaker A does not have children and spends time working and reading.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more helpful because it provides multiple relevant points about Speaker A's current career considerations, which align directly with Speaker B's question asking if Speaker A is considering other work options. MEMORY 2 shows Speaker A is indeed considering other careers, specifically in dentistry or at Disney, which would be directly relevant to the question at hand. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, only focuses on Speaker A's interest in dentistry and lacks broader context about their career considerations.\n\nChoice: 2"
