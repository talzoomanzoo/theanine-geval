    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\nSpeaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call!\nSpeaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip?  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A is a librarian and loves kids, mentioning having 3 children. This makes Speaker A busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.

This led Speaker B to take their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT shows that Speaker B has mentioned the idea of an annual fishing trip and has asked Speaker A if they have thought any more about it. The key information needed here is related to the fishing trip and Speaker B's interest in making it an annual tradition, as well as any relevant background on their family dynamics that might influence this decision. \n\nMEMORY 1 includes necessary details such as Speaker B's interest in making the fishing trip an annual tradition and their grandkids' mixed reactions. It also provides a connection to Speaker A by explaining that they have children and are busy with work, which could be relevant to their thoughts on participating in the fishing trip.\n\nMEMORY 2 also includes relevant details about the fishing trip and Speaker B's family dynamics. However, it includes additional, less relevant information about grandkids being more interested in phones and tablets, which does not directly contribute to the discussion about the fishing trip. \n\nMEMORY 1 is more focused, providing just the essential information needed for Speaker A to respond effectively to the question about the fishing trip idea.\n\nChoice: 1"
