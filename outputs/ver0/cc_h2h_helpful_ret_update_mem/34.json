Do you remember when we were working on that movie together and you were feeling really frustrated? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1.

    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 and Memory 2 largely contain the same information, but Memory 2 includes additional detail: Co-worker B emphasized the importance of learning from mistakes and working together as a team. This detail is relevant because Co-worker B is referencing a time when Co-worker A felt frustrated during a project, which could be related to challenges that required learning and teamwork. Therefore, Memory 2 provides a more helpful context for Co-worker B to continue discussing the importance of their past collaboration and support.\n\nChoice: 2"
