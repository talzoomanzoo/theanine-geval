    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Parent to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: Child, I have a new project that I've been working on.\nChild: What is it, Parent?\nParent: I created a website where I post advertisements, and people can pay to see them.\nChild: Oh, that's interesting. How does it work?\nParent: Well, I create the ads myself, and then I post them on my website. People who want to view the ads can pay a small fee, and then they can see them.\nChild: Do you think people will pay to see your ads?\nParent: I don't know yet, but I hope so. I've put a lot of effort into creating some eye-catching ads.\nChild: That sounds cool, but why do you want to make money from ads?\nParent: Well, I want to have some extra income coming in. Plus, I enjoy being creative and making things, so this is a great way for me to combine those passions.\nChild: I see. Well, I hope it works out for you, Parent.\nParent: Thanks, Child. And who knows, maybe someday you can help me create some ads for the website.\nChild: Sure, that sounds like fun! Speaking of creativity, remember that time we made those homemade decorations together? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- The Parent acknowledges being lazy about washing dishes and promises to contribute more to keeping the home clean.\n- The Parent has seen a doctor and is taking medicine for their illness.\n- The Parent expresses a desire to be a better role model for the Child and their siblings.\n- The Child is caring and offers help to the Parent.\n- The parent and child have open communication about various topics, including a past accident and the parent's willingness to contribute more to household chores.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. The Child is caring and offers help to the Parent.\n2. The Child supports the idea of the Parent adopting more children and hopes for a happy home for them.\n3. The parent and child have open communication about various topics, including a past accident and the parent's willingness to contribute more to household chores.\n4. The Parent expresses a desire to be a better role model for the Child and their siblings.\n5. The Parent is working and feels tired after a long day.\n6. The child expresses gratitude for being adopted by the parent and believes other children will be lucky to have them as a parent.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 offer some elements that seem relevant, like the open communication and the parent's desire to be a role model. However, MEMORY 2 offers more context related to the Parent's work and creativity, which aligns with the dialogue about creating a website and ads. This makes MEMORY 2 slightly more helpful in the given context as it underlines the Parent's work ethic and role model goals, which are pertinent in a conversation about a creative project.\n\nChoice: 2"
