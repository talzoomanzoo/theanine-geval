    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context focuses on Co-worker A surprising Co-worker B with their singing talent and later being reminded of Co-worker A's mystery-solving skills. MEMORY 1 directly relates to Co-worker A's described talent for solving mysteries, their enjoyment of it, and even hints at pursuing a career as a detective, which aligns with the reminder mentioned by Co-worker B. MEMORY 2 contains extraneous details about Co-worker B's personal life and Co-worker A's research skills not directly related to the dialogue. Therefore, MEMORY 1 is more helpful as it better aligns with the context of the conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
