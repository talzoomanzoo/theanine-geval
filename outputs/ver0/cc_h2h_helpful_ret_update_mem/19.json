    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm sorry you had to hear me swear like that. I shouldn't have lost my temper like that.\nNeighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset?\nNeighbors A: It was just something that happened at work. My boss was being unreasonable and I couldn't take it anymore.\nNeighbors B: That's understandable. Have you tried talking to your boss about it?\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I have, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I just feel like I'm stuck in a dead-end job.\nNeighbors B: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you considered looking for a new job?\nNeighbors A: I have, but with the current job market, it's really tough. Plus, I don't have a lot of experience in other fields.\nNeighbors B: Well, I'll keep an ear out for any job openings that might be a good fit for you. In the meantime, maybe try finding ways to de-stress after work? I find that exercise helps me when I'm feeling frustrated. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbor A mentioned the importance of keeping outside spaces clean and maintained for the future. This aligns with the mutual support Neighbors A and B show each other, as seen when Neighbors A helped with their lawn. Additionally, Neighbors A values appreciation and expresses gratitude for help received, highlighting the supportive and helpful dynamic between them.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbors B is supportive and understanding of Neighbors A's mistake.\n2. Neighbors A values appreciation and expresses gratitude for help received.\n3. Neighbors A and B have a positive and helpful relationship as neighbors.\n4. Neighbors A wants to rearrange their living room and Neighbors B has experience with rearranging furniture.\n5. Neighbors A is detail-oriented and strives for perfection.\n6. Neighbors B values reciprocity and acknowledges the mutual help between them as neighbors.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 2 provides a broader context relevant to their supportive and understanding dynamic, which is directly applicable to the current dialogue context. It highlights Neighbors B's support, which aligns with their suggestion to help keep an ear out for jobs, and also emphasizes the mutual positive relationship between the neighbors, reinforcing the encouragement and advice given in the dialogue. Memory 1, while mentioning mutual support, does not specifically pertain to the job or stress context, thus offering less directly relevant information.\n\nChoice: 2"
