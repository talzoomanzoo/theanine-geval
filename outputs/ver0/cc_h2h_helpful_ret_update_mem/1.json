    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about the Mentee feeling lonely in a new city. The most relevant MEMORY would include information that relates directly to the Mentee's current situation, such as their recent move and any context related to their feelings of loneliness. MEMORY 1 includes a specific point (3) about the Mentee deciding to take a job in the city, which is relevant to their current feeling of loneliness due to the move. It also contains reassurances that can be helpful in addressing feelings of loneliness, point (2) though not directly related to moving, suggesting companionship or understanding. MEMORY 2 combines several facts but does not emphasize the specific move to the city leading to loneliness, making MEMORY 1 more directly relevant and helpful for addressing the Mentee's current situation and concerns about loneliness.\n\nChoice: 1"
