    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is therefore important to ensure that the MEMORY contains only the information that is necessary for the response to be appropriate and effective.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, how's it going?\nNeighbors B: Not bad, thanks. How about you?\nNeighbors A: Oh, I'm doing alright. I was just thinking about the old days when I had my rock band.\nNeighbors B: Really? You had a band?\nNeighbors A: Yeah, we were called \"The Neighbors A Band.\" We used to play live shows around the city.\nNeighbors B: That's awesome! What kind of music did you guys play?\nNeighbors A: We played rock music, mostly covers but we also wrote some of our own songs.\nNeighbors B: Have you ever thought about starting the band again? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- Neighbor A offered to provide the name of their chiropractor to Neighbor B if they decide to go. Neighbor A and Neighbor B enjoy playing together with toys. Neighbor B is familiar with Neighbor A's dog and looking forward to playing with it again. Neighbor A appreciated the support and friendship of Neighbor B.\n- Neighbor B is interested in chiropractic care after hearing about Neighbor A's positive experience. Neighbor A looks forward to playing with Neighbor B again when feeling better. Neighbor A recently moved to London from their current location. Neighbor A moved to London in the past and had to learn how to manage stress.\n- Neighbor A offered to provide the name of their chiropractor to Neighbor B if they decide to go. Neighbor A and Neighbor B enjoy playing together with toys. Neighbor A appreciated the support and friendship of Neighbor B.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbors A appreciated the support and friendship of Neighbors B.\n2. Neighbors B is familiar with Neighbors A's dog and looking forward to playing with it again.\n3. Neighbors B expresses concern for Neighbors A's back pain.\n4. Neighbor B is interested in chiropractic care after hearing about Neighbor A's positive experience.\n5. Neighbor A offered to provide the name of their chiropractor to Neighbor B if they decide to go.\n6. Neighbors A is enjoying the different culture and exploring the city.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains information about various topics such as chiropractic care, playing with toys, and moving to London, which are unrelated to the topic of \"The Neighbors A Band\" and rock music. MEMORY 2, while also including non-relevant information about chiropractic care, contains less irrelevant information overall. The mention of appreciating support and friendship could subtly connect to the topic of considering restarting a band due to social encouragement, but MEMORY 1 expands needlessly on topics that do not contribute to the relevant conversation about music and bands.\n\nChoice: 2"
