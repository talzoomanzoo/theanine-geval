    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 contains a variety of information about Speaker A's outdoor habits, including relevant details like their interest in wildlife and looking for rare animals, which could be helpful in addressing the question about encountering predators. Memory 2, while providing some relevant context about wildlife encounters and outdoor activities, mainly highlights a past sighting of a rare hawk and Speaker B's dislike of bugs, which are somewhat relevant but less focused on the specific topic of predator encounters when camping. \n\nChoice: 1"
