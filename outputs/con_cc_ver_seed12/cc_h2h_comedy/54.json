What did you do there?\nCo-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done.\nCo-workers B: That's good. I hate going to the post office. It's always so crowded.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it was pretty busy today. But I needed to get this package sent out.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of packages, remember that time when you got stranded because you couldn't drive yourself home from a night out with friends? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers A: Yeah, that was a rough night. I've been working on being more responsible with my outings since then.\nRESPONSE 2\nCo-workers A:  Yeah, I remember that night. It was a good thing you called for a ride instead of attempting to drive. It's always better to plan ahead and make sure you get home safely. I'm glad everything turned out okay in the end.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 is consistent with Co-worker A's past memories of working on being more responsible, including avoiding late nights out and managing their transportation more reliably. Response 2, however, introduces an element not found in the past memories, which is Co-worker A calling for a ride on that specific night instead of attempting to drive. This information isn't supported by any past memories and could contradict the aspect of Co-worker B being more aware of A's expensive Uber rides rather than them planning ahead. Therefore, Response 1 is more consistent with the shared history.\n\nChoice: 1"
