I've been lifting a lot of heavy wood lately, it's good exercise.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses relate to the context of gaining strength, which is relevant to Neighbors A's comment about becoming strong. However, Response 2 mentions \"lifting a lot of heavy wood,\" which ties back to the past memories of Neighbors A and B observing freshly cut wood and discussing its uses. This makes Response 2 more consistent with the past memories, as it aligns with previous discussions about wood. Response 1, on the other hand, introduces new information about going to the gym that is not connected to anything in the past memories, making it less consistent.\n\nChoice: 2"
