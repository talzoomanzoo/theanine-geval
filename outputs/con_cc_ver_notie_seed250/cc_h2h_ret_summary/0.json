However, according to the past memories, there is no mention or indication that the child was present or directly involved during the parent's time in juvenile detention. The child's memories are related to events after the parent's detention, such as supporting the parent's journey to turn their life around and the special tradition of watching the sunrise together. Response 1 is consistent with the past memories as it focuses on the parent's personal experience and growth regarding the importance of listening during difficult times without implying the child's involvement during detention.\n\nChoice: 1"
