    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are consistent with the past memories and current conversation as they do not reference any past event in a contradictory manner. However, the focus is only on the current emotional situation of Neighbor A, not on the mentioned previous topics or context such as their move to a new neighborhood, video games, or grieving a grandmother. As the specific past conversation details about the relationship failure are not mentioned, both responses remain consistent within the scope of the current conversation about relationship issues.\n\nChoice: Both responses are equally consistent since neither introduces contradicting details from the past memories. Both focus on the current emotional context of Neighbor A."
