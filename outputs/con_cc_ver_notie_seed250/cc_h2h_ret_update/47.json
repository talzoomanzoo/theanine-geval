    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are largely consistent with past memories, as they both convey Co-worker A's willingness to collaborate and value Co-worker B's input, which aligns with their history of resolving issues together and valuing communication. However, response 2 slightly emphasizes the ongoing partnership and the intent to strengthen the team, which is more consistent with Co-worker A and B's ability to work well and connect with each other. Response 1, while consistent, is a bit more general and lacks the explicit mention of continued collaboration strength.\n\nChoice: 2"
