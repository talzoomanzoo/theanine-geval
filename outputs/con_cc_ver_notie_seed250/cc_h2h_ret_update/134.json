However, Response 1 focuses more on Neighbors A's relief and plans for future business success, which aligns with their current entrepreneurial pursuit and past work issues. Response 2 mentions the silver lining and appreciates Neighbors B's support, which aligns with their supportive relationship, but the emphasis in past memories is more on Neighbors A's ambition and change rather than on acknowledging Neighbors B's role. As per the past memories, Neighbors A is putting effort into improving and succeeding, which is more directly addressed in Response 1.\n\nChoice: 1"
