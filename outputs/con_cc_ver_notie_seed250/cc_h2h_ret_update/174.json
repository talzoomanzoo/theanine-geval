    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 2 is consistent with past memories as it reflects Classmate A's acknowledgment of past advice to work hard and stay focused on their goals. It also aligns with the encouragement previously given by Classmate B about not letting doubts hold Classmate A back and asking for help when needed. There is no contradiction with past behaviors or attitudes. On the other hand, Response 1 introduces a new element (\"feeling overwhelmed\") without directly linking it to past memories or actions, which may slightly disconnect from the focus on achieving goals and past discussions. However, both responses can be seen as consistent; Response 2 provides a more direct and clear connection to past themes of hard work and seeking help.\n\nChoice: 2"
