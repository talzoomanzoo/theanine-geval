    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 2 is consistent with the past memories as it reflects Classmate B's support and encouragement for Classmate A to stay focused, work hard, and believe in themselves, as well as offering help if neededâ€”which align with previous conversations about pursuing their basketball dream. There is no contradiction with past memories here. Response 1, while it emphasizes hard work and dedication, comes off as less supportive considering the current context of A's struggles, and it doesn't directly offer help or guidance as Response 2 does, which aligns better with Classmate B's previous behavior.\n\nChoice: 2"
