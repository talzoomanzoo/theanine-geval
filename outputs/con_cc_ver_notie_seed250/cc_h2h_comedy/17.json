    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 is consistent with the past memory that mentions Neighbor B being comforting and supportive, as it expresses support and encouragement regarding Neighbor A's hope for a good relationship with their future children. Response 2, however, seems to shift the topic to looking forward to something without clear context from the past memories or conversation, making it less consistent.\n\nChoice: 1"
