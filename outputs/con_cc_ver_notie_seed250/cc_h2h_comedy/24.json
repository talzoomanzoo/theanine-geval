    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are generally consistent with the past memories, as they align with Co-worker A and B's mutual trust and excitement about their future partnership. However, Response 1 is more focused on the business partnership, which is a specific conversation point mentioned previously, while Response 2 introduces an additional element of a personal partnership (\"in life\") that is not explicitly consistent with the past memories provided. The past memories focus on their professional collaboration rather than a broader life partnership.\n\nChoice: 1"
