    "prediction": "My apologies, it seems there was an error in the additional information. Let me provide a correct explanation for choosing the better response based on consistency with past memories.\n\nExplanation: Response 1 is consistent with the current conversation and the past memories, focusing on the time and patience needed to make new friends, which aligns with the supportive and realistic guidance the Mentor has provided in the past. Response 2, although it includes a suggestion consistent with the Mentee's interests, contains an error because it mistakenly refers to the Mentor addressing the Mentor as \"Mentor,\" which is contradictory to the correct conversational flow where the Mentor should be addressing the Mentee. This inconsistency disrupts the continuity and appropriateness of the conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
