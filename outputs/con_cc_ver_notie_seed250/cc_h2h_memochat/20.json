I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers A: I understand what you're saying, Co-worker B, but I can't help how I feel. Love can make us do crazy things sometimes.\nRESPONSE 2\nCo-workers A: Co-workers A, it's important to remember that love involves respecting someone's choices and feelings. Kidnapping or forcing someone to be with you is not a healthy or loving action. It's essential to communicate openly and respectfully about your feelings rather than resorting to drastic measures. Let's find a better way to handle this situation that respects the other person's autonomy and feelings.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 2 contradicts the consistency criterion because it involves Co-worker A referring to themselves in the third person, which is inconsistent with natural conversation patterns. Additionally, response 2 feels out of character for Co-worker A, who is described as an individual full of positivity, bravery, and humility. It reads more like an external perspective rather than being consistent with the personal and direct style expected from Co-worker A. Response 1 doesn't introduce external inconsistencies to the established character and narrative, as it reflects human struggles and complexities in keeping with the other memory snippets.\n\nChoice: 1"
