    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 1 is consistent with the past memories because Co-worker A acknowledges Co-worker B's support and encouragement, which is a recurring theme in their relationship. It reflects Co-worker A's excitement and readiness to take on the new role, aligning with the aspirations and growth mentioned in the past. On the other hand, Response 2 contains a contradiction, as Co-worker A mistakenly responds as if congratulating Co-worker B instead of acknowledging their own promotion, which disrupts the flow of the conversation and their respective roles.\n\nChoice: 1"
