    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 1 is more consistent with the student's usual behavior of focusing on their own experience and seeking appropriate solutions, as seen in their desire for quick action and effective problem-solving mentioned in past memories. Response 2, however, contains a shift in perspective that contradicts the nature of the conversation, where the student starts advising someone else, which doesn't align with the memories focusing on the student's own experiences and actions. Furthermore, the student was the one experiencing the hot sauce's effects, making it inconsistent for them to talk about the situation as though it's happening to someone else.\n\nChoice: 1"
