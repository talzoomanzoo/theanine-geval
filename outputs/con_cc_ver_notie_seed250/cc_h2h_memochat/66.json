How does it work?\nParent: Well, I create the ads myself, and then I post them on my website. People who want to view the ads can pay a small fee, and then they can see them. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nChild: That sounds like a creative way to generate income, Parent. Have you had many people interested in viewing the ads on your website?\nRESPONSE 2\nChild: That sounds like a creative project you have been working on! It's great to see you exploring new ideas and initiatives. If you need any help or support with your website or advertisements, feel free to ask me.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are consistent with the past memories as they do not contradict any previous information. The only slight difference is that Response 2 offers help, which aligns with the child's supportive nature shown in past memories about being caring and offering help to the parent. However, neither response contradicts past memories, so for the criterion of consistency alone, both are valid.\n\nChoice: 1 (as it stays focused on the current topic of interest in the project, without introducing new information not covered in the memories)"
