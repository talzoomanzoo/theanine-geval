    "prediction": "Explanation: \nThe choice of responses should reflect consistency with the past memories provided. Consistency involves selecting a response that matches and does not contradict the details about the characters' lives and interactions. Response 1 indicates that Classmate B wishes to be self-sufficient, which is consistent with Classmate B's interest in learning and creating music independently (working on a new original song on the guitar). Response 2 seems to misunderstand the situation by suggesting that Classmate A is the one feeling frustrated, despite Classmate B expressing their frustration. This is inconsistent with the current conversation where Classmate B is the one expressing frustration.\n\nChoice: 1"
