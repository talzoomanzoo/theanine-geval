    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 is consistent with the memories as it reflects an understanding and acceptance of the mentor's advice, aligns with the mentee's demonstrated ability to weigh options and make mature decisions, and shows a positive attitude toward new experiences, which is consistent with the feeling of gratitude and learning from the mentor's guidance in past situations. Response 2, however, confusingly refers to the mentee in the third person, and it's phrased as if the mentee is giving advice instead of responding to the mentor's support, which does not align with the mentee's usual way of interacting with the mentor.\n\nChoice: 1"
