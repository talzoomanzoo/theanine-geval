    "prediction": "Explanation: \nBoth responses focus on Co-worker A's promotion and encouraging them for their new role. However, Response 1 suggests focusing on Co-worker A's \"leadership style,\" which might be inconsistent since Co-worker A used to fantasize about leadership and only recently stepped into an actual leadership role. The past memories do not directly indicate that Co-worker A has established their own leadership style yet. Response 2, on the other hand, maintains consistency by acknowledging Co-worker A's ability to take things one step at a time, aligning with the advice Co-worker B has given them before.\n\nChoice: 2"
