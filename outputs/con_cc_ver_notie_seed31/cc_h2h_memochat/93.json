    "prediction": "Explanation: Both response options align with the past memories and current conversation, as they build on Classmates A's suggestion for Classmates B to make a list of independent goals. However, the focus is on consistency with past actions and behavior. Response 1 is more consistent, as it aligns with the supportive and friendly relationship between Classmates A and B. It reflects Classmates B's acknowledgment of Classmates A's support, which is consistent with their previous interactions. Response 2, although supportive, introduces specific phrases (\"By making a list of things you'd like to do on your own\") that were not mentioned by Classmate A, and it can make it seem like Classmate B is reiterating what Classmate A has already said, which might not be as natural in the flow of conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
