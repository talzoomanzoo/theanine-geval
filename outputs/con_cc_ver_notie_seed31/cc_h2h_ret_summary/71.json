    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses do not contain direct contradictions to past memories; however, Response 2 aligns closely with the existing memories, particularly the memory of Classmate A remaining calm and demonstrating quick thinking during the space incident, which Classmate B admired. Classmate B mentions an emergency drill, which implies a situation where calmness is crucial, thus recalling the memory of Classmate A's ability to remain calm and handle stressful situations effectively. On the contrary, Response 1 introduces an unrelated incident that neither contradicts nor aligns with the past memories.\n\nChoice: 2"
