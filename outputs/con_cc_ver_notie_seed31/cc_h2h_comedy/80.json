    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 is consistent with the past memories, as it aligns with the fact that Classmate B was previously stressed and was helped by Classmate A. Classmate A showed concern for Classmate B's well-being in a similar context, offering support via stress-relieving massages. However, Response 2 seems more appropriate as it directly matches the supportive and trusting relationship they have. Classmate A is asking for what Classmate B wants to share, maintaining the idea of mutual support and listening, as they have a history of being there for each other. This fits with the mention of Classmate A being supportive and having a level of trust between them.\n\nChoice: 2"
