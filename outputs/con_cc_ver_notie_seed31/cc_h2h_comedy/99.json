You've got this!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are supportive and encouraging, which is consistent with the wife's desire to help her husband with his creative process. However, Response 2 is slightly inconsistent because it contains terms of endearment (\"my love\") that we have no evidence are part of their typical way of addressing each other based on the past memories. It also places more emphasis on the wife's support, while the conversation was more focused on trying new things, making Response 1 more in line with the current conversation's focus on stepping out of the comfort zone.\n\nChoice: 1"
