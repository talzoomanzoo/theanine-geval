    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 is consistent because it does not introduce information that contradicts any past memories, and it follows naturally from the conversation where Classmates B feels embarrassed but hasn't specified the reason yet. Response 2, however, introduces an event related to Classmates A's embarrassment, which was not mentioned or implied in the conversation or past memories. Therefore, Response 1 is more consistent with the provided information.\n\nChoice: 1"
