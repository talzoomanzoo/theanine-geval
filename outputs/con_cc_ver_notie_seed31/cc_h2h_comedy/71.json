    "prediction": "Explanation: In the provided past memories, it is Classmate A, not Classmate B, who is known for striving for excellence and giving 110% effort in everything they do. Additionally, the memories do not indicate that Classmate B has been involved in navigating through unexpected events; this information relates more to Classmate A's past experiences. Thus, Response 2 contains inconsistencies with what is known about Classmate B. Response 1, on the other hand, does not contradict any past memories and is consistent with the type of embarrassing, everyday scenario that Classmate B is likely to experience.\n\nChoice: 1"
