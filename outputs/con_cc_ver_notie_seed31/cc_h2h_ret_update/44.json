    "prediction": "Explanation: Both neighbors have expressed a supportive and friendly relationship in past memories, particularly when it comes to job challenges and life changes. However, the conversation starter by Neighbors A (\"I'm a millionaire now!\") suggests that Neighbors A has experienced a significant personal achievement or change. Given that Neighbors A had been feeling stagnant in their job and was looking for growth, it aligns with the idea that this newfound wealth might be a result of a career change or other personal success. Response 2 aligns with this context as it acknowledges hard work and personal achievement, which is consistent with Neighbors A's past career challenge and change. In contrast, Response 1 suggests that it is Neighbors B who is a millionaire, which contradicts the context that Neighbors A is the one who made a big career change and is now sharing their achievement.\n\nChoice: 2"
