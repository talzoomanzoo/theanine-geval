    "prediction": "Explanation: The past memories mention various aspects of Neighbors A's and B's lives and relationship, but there is no information about Neighbors A receiving an inheritance or becoming a millionaire. Both response options do not contradict the past memories since they acknowledge the new information about Neighbor A becoming a millionaire. Neither response implies anything inconsistent with the memories, such as suggesting the money is from the job change or any other source related to past events. Given this, both responses are consistent in terms of the past memories. \n\nChoice: 1"
