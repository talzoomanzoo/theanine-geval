    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a detailed context about the incident where the husband left without his wife, acknowledging the broken promise and discussing ways to improve communication and uphold promises. This memory aligns closely with the current apology context in the dialogue, offering a supportive base for the Wife’s response to the Husband’s apology and future plans. MEMORY 1, while relevant, lacks specific strategies for improvement discussed between the couple, which would be more helpful for the Wife's next response.\n\nChoice: 2"
