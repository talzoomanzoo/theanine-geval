    "prediction": "Explanation: The current dialogue context revolves around Classmate A comforting Classmate B and sharing personal experiences to reassure them. MEMORY 1 highlights Classmate A's positive attitude and resilience, which are relevant as these qualities could help Classmate A relate to Classmate B's embarrassment. Meanwhile, MEMORY 2 emphasizes shared past experiences and mutual support between the classmates, which also fits well, particularly the focus on mutual support. However, MEMORY 1 aligns more directly with the current need for reassurance by emphasizing Classmate A's positive handling of public embarrassment, matching Classmate B's situation.\n\nChoice: 1"
