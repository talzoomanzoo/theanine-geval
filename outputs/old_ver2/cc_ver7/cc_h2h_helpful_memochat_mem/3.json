The better memory would enhance the Co-workers B’s ability to respond accurately and in context.\n\nNOTE:\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is to be regarded as an unhelpful memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nCo-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\nCo-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\nCo-worker A is described as positive and able to stay optimistic even in challenging situations, like the accident where they lost their hands and feet.\nCo-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's positivity and friendship.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nCo-worker B showed a willingness to assist others by helping a customer resolve an issue last week. This demonstrates Co-worker B's supportive nature and readiness to help in any way. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it, similar to when they spoke with the police about an incident where the women involved were thankful. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time. \nCo-worker B commended Co-worker A for their bravery and willingness to help, leading Co-worker A to try to stay positive and focus on their recovery despite it being a daunting task. Co-worker B admires Co-worker A's resilience and positivity, describing them as someone who can stay optimistic even in challenging situations, such as the accident where they lost their hands and feet.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Admitting a Small Guilt', 'Related Summaries': 'Co-workers A confesses to borrowing a pencil without asking, feeling guilty, but Co-workers B reassures them and suggests a solution.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Co-workers A: Hey, B.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 includes information that is more relevant to Co-worker A's character, specifically the reassurance and positivity in their relationship highlighted by Co-worker B. This could help Co-worker B respond with empathy and understanding towards Co-worker A's irrational plan. MEMORY 2, while mentioning the pencil incident, doesn't add context about the positivity and respect Co-worker B holds for Co-worker A, which might be important in guiding Co-worker B's response to the current scenario.\n\nChoice: 1"
