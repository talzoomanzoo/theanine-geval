I remember running to my mom and dad whenever I saw one. ### Co-workers B: That's understandable. I mean, some people just have a fear of certain things. ### Co-workers A: Remember when I blew up the rabbit with dynamite? I think I was frustrated with myself and took it out on the poor thing. ### Co-workers B: Yeah, I remember you regretting that decision later on. It's important to find healthy ways to deal with our frustrations. ### Co-workers A: You're right. I need to work on that more. Maybe I can try some relaxation techniques or find a hobby to de-stress. ### Co-workers B: Definitely. It's all about finding what works for you.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 is more relevant because it directly relates to the experience Co-worker A and Co-worker B had while working on the movie. It highlights their strong bond and mutual respect, which can be supportive contextually given Co-worker B's reference to Co-worker A's past frustration during the movie project. In contrast, MEMORY 2 discusses facing fears and managing frustrations with unrelated examples that don't connect as directly with the current dialogue on the supportive relationship dynamic.\n\nChoice: 1"
