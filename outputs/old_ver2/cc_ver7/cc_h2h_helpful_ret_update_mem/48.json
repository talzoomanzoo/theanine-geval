    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 focuses on the supportive dynamic between the husband and wife, reiterating the wife's reassurance that it's okay to be different and encouraging the husband to embrace who he is. This aligns well with the wife's current supportive stance in the dialogue, where she encourages her husband to take risks and overcome his creative block by recalling his past experience with public speaking. MEMORY 2 introduces unrelated issues such as the husband's previous partner and a reference to falling asleep during a movie, which may not be as relevant to the current context of creative encouragement.\n\nChoice: 1"
