The better memory would enhance the Neighbors A’s ability to respond accurately and in context.\n\nNOTE:\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is to be regarded as an unhelpful memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nNeighbors A and B live in the same neighborhood and help each other with tasks.\nNeighbors A and B are helpful towards each other.\nNeighbors B is supportive and understanding of Neighbors A's mistake.\nNeighbors B values reciprocity and acknowledges the mutual help between them as neighbors.\nNeighbors A and B have a positive and helpful relationship as neighbors.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm sorry you had to hear me swear like that.

Have you considered looking for a new job?\nNeighbors A: I have, but with the current job market, it's really tough. Plus, I don't have a lot of experience in other fields.\nNeighbors B: Well, I'll keep an ear out for any job openings that might be a good fit for you. In the meantime, maybe try finding ways to de-stress after work? I find that exercise helps me when I'm feeling frustrated. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbor A mentioned the importance of keeping outside spaces clean and maintained for the future.
