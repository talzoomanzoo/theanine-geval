    "prediction": "Explanation: To determine which memory is more helpful, we should consider which one provides supportive context to Classmates A's current response. In the current dialogue, Classmates A is trying to reassure Classmates B by sharing a personal embarrassing moment. It's about support, understanding, and a bit of humor. Both memories contain elements of support, admiration, and strong interpersonal relationships.

Memory 1, while highlighting Classmates A's exemplary attitude, does not add more supportive details that enhance the current context.\n\nChoice: 2"
