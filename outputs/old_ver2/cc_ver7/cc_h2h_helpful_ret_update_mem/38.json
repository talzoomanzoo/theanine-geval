The better memory would enhance the Neighbors A’s ability to respond accurately and in context.\n\nNOTE:\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is to be regarded as an unhelpful memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nNeighbors A and B both took a cooking class together last year.\nNeighbors B wants to try making something new in cooking and suggests looking at the cookbook from the class.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just got back from my trip to South America.

The view from the top is breathtaking.\nNeighbors B: Have you thought about where you want to go next? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbors A taught the kid the special move to help them feel better, and Neighbors B agreed to buy candy for the neighborhood kids to spread happiness. Neighbors B then admired Neighbors A's organization skills and expressed a desire to enhance their own organization. In response, Neighbor A showed willingness to take precautions and make smart decisions. \n\nNeighbors A won against a kid in chess by using a special move, which led both Neighbors A and B to believe in the value of doing good deeds to strengthen the community.

Neighbor B recommended alternative ways to manage stress and emphasized the importance of Neighbor A's well-being.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1.

Neighbors A and B both took a cooking class together last year.\n4. Both Neighbors A and B believe in the importance of learning and self-improvement.\n5. Neighbor A is feeling frustrated and is considering going to a bar to find someone for a casual encounter.\n6. Neighbor B suggests finding other ways to relieve frustration and looking out for Neighbor A's well-being.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 provides details on a chess game, a kid, community values, and organizational skills, none of which directly relate to the current dialogue about travel and new cooking experiences. Memory 2 also contains mostly unrelated details; however, it does include a point about both neighbors having taken a cooking class together last year, which ties into the previous dialogue summary and could be relevant if the travel experiences inspire a new type of cooking. Therefore, Memory 2, by including the reference to the cooking class, is marginally more helpful because it has an element relevant to their shared cooking interest which could be explored further with the new experiences.\n\nChoice: 2"
