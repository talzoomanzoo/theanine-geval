    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - Helpfulness refers to which MEMORY provides relevant and supportive context to the Classmates A’s next response based on the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The better memory would enhance the Classmates A’s ability to respond accurately and in context.\n\nNOTE:\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is to be regarded as an unhelpful memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nClassmates B had to apologize for a mix-up due to two people having the same name.\nClassmates B made sure to double-check everything to resolve the issue and prevent it from happening again.\nClassmates B handled a previous mix-up with the class schedule well, showing responsibility and reliability.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to share something with you. I helped out a neighbor in need over the weekend.\nClassmates B: That's really kind of you. What did you do to help?\nClassmates A: She was moving and needed some extra hands to pack up her things and load them onto a truck. So I spent most of the day helping her out.\nClassmates B: Wow, that's really generous of you. I'm sure your neighbor really appreciated it.\nClassmates A: I hope so. I just felt like it was the right thing to do. I know if I were in that situation, I would appreciate any help I could get.\nClassmates B: Absolutely. It's important to be there for each other, especially in tough times.\nClassmates A: Yes, and it feels good to make a difference in someone's life, even if it's just in a small way.\nClassmates B: Definitely. It's the small acts of kindness that can make the biggest impact. Remembers when we talked about how I made sure the mix-up won't happen again? That was because I wanted to make a small impact, like you did for your neighbor. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Classmates A appreciates Classmates B's efforts and support, leading to Classmates B being supportive and helpful to Classmates A, which then results in Classmates B advising Classmates A to drive safely to avoid accidents.\n2. Classmates A appreciates Classmates B's efforts and support, as well as the support and friendship of Classmates B, where Classmates B was initially worried about Classmates A going out with friends but they value each other's opinions.\n3. Classmates A appreciates Classmates B's efforts and support, which motivates Classmates B to be supportive and helpful to Classmates A, and also leads to Classmates B initially being worried about Classmates A going out with friends but they value each other's opinions.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Classmates A appreciates Classmates B's efforts and support.\n2. Classmates A appreciates the support and friendship of Classmates B.\n3. Classmates B handled a previous mix-up with the class schedule well, showing responsibility and reliability.\n4. Classmates A and B started as acquaintances and have developed a strong friendship.\n5. Classmates B was initially worried about Classmates A going out with friends but they value each other's opinions.\n6. Classmates A and B value their friendship and feel comfortable talking to each other about anything.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 2 provides relevant context aligning with the theme of appreciation for efforts and support in the dialogue. It emphasizes the development of a strong friendship and acknowledges Classmates B's reliability in handling a mix-up, reflecting their responsible nature. This is consistent with Classmates B acknowledging and drawing parallels between their past actions and Classmates A's recent act of kindness. Memory 1, on the other hand, tangentially mentions concern and advice related to driving safely, which is not pertinent to the current discussion on kindness and support.\n\nChoice: 2"
