    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories focus on the theme of kindness, learning, and community involvement, but Memory 2 contains a specific connection to the previous cooking class, which aligns with Neighbor B's interest in trying new recipes—this is directly relevant to the current dialogue context where Neighbor B is sharing their interest in cooking. Although Memory 1 touches on self-improvement and community values, it lacks specific references that connect directly with the cooking class context or travel. Therefore, Memory 2 provides supportive context based on shared past activities that align with the immediate interests in the ongoing conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
