    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 includes irrelevant incidents like running out of a store without paying for shoes and doesn't add meaningful context to the mentee's feeling of loneliness in a new city. While MEMORY 2 provides a much richer context by describing the mentee's achievements and dedication, it also emphasizes the close and supportive relationship between the mentee and mentor, which is crucial for addressing the mentee's current feelings of loneliness. This context would allow the mentor to provide encouragement based on the mentee's strengths and past resilience.\n\nChoice: 2"
