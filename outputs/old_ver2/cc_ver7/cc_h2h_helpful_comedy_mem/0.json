    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories provide context about the relationship between the Parent and the Child, emphasizing the supportive and caring nature of their interaction. Memory 1 focuses on the Parent's journey and the Child's admiration and support, which could be useful in discussing how the Parent felt during detention and the importance of being heard and supported.

Overall, Memory 1 offers a slightly more relevant context for the immediate question about detention experiences and feeling heard.\n\nChoice: 1"
