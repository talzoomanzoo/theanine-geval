    "prediction": "Explanation: \nThe current dialogue context involves a situation where Classmates A is curious about how Classmates B knows about something from their past, and Classmates B is unable to disclose that information. MEMORY 2 provides relevant context as it introduces the theme of curiosity (meeting a mysterious woman in a dark alley) and a previous warning (Classmates B advising Classmates A to be careful) that may relate to how Classmates B knows about Classmates A's past. This could help Classmates B respond more relevantly to Classmates A's curiosity about how their past became known to B. Meanwhile, MEMORY 1 does not directly address this situation as effectively, focusing more on positivity and relationships without clear relevance to the current conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
