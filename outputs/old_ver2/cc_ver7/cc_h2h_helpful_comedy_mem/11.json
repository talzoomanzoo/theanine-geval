    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 and Memory 2 both contain relevant information for Neighbors B's response. Memory 1 highlights the mutual respect and growth in their friendship, which reflects their previous conversation about power dynamics evolving into a relationship based on equality and mutual respect. This directly aligns with Neighbors B's most recent comments in the dialogue. Memory 2, however, provides context on the religious practices of Neighbors A and their recent move to a new neighborhood, both of which are relevant but less directly connected to the immediate conversation about friendship dynamics.\n\nChoice: 1"
