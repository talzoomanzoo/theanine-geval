    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - Helpfulness refers to which MEMORY provides relevant and supportive context to the Co-workers A’s next response based on the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The better memory would enhance the Co-workers A’s ability to respond accurately and in context.\n\nNOTE:\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is to be regarded as an unhelpful memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nCo-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument.\nCo-worker B is supportive and interested in the evidence collected by Co-worker A.\nCo-worker A's evidence includes statistics and personal accounts from clients.\nCo-worker A believes their evidence is more compelling than the opposing side's evidence.\nCo-worker A plans to present the evidence clearly and persuasively in court.\nCo-worker A has presented evidence in front of a judge to support their position in the past.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message.\nCo-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of skills, you always present a compelling argument in debates. I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument. This experience has led to Co-worker A presenting evidence in front of a judge to support their position in the past, where they denied that their reputation had any impact on Karen giving them the money.\n   \n2. Co-worker A plans to present the evidence clearly and persuasively in court, which has already changed to Co-worker A having presented evidence in front of a judge to support their position in the past. In that instance, Co-worker A denied that their reputation had any impact on Karen giving them the money.\n   \n3. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument. This has led Co-worker B to commend Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs, resulting in Co-worker A being willing to take on the project of building a deck for Co-worker B.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker A plans to present the evidence clearly and persuasively in court.\n2. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument.\n3. Co-worker A has presented evidence in front of a judge to support their position in the past.\n4. Co-worker B commends Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs.\n5. Co-worker A's evidence includes statistics and personal accounts from clients.\n6. Co-worker B is supportive and interested in the evidence collected by Co-worker A.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides all points from the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY that help maintain context, such as Co-worker A’s confidence in their argument, their plan for court presentation, prior experience presenting evidence in front of a judge, and the presence of supportive Co-worker B. MEMORY 2 includes more relevant details without conflicting information, offering supportive context for Co-worker A's enjoyment of public speaking and presentation skills. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, includes irrelevant details about Karen and building a deck, which do not relate to the current dialogue about speaking and presenting evidence.\n\nChoice: 2"
