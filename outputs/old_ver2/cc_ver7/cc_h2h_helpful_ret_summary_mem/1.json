    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 primarily focuses on different scenarios unrelated to the Mentee's current feelings of loneliness, such as the college application process and a past incident involving taking shoes. MEMORY 2, while it does include some of the same irrelevant details, also holds the crucial detail about the mentee taking the job in the city, which directly relates to the Mentee's new context of feeling lonely in a new place. MEMORY 2 also includes a point about reassurance, which could be helpful if the Mentor wants to continue providing emotional support.\n\nChoice: 2"
