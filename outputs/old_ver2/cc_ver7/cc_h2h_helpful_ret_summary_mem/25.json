But I needed to get this package sent out.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of packages, remember that time when you got stranded because you couldn't drive yourself home from a night out with friends?\nCo-workers A: Ugh, don't remind me. That was such a disaster.\nCo-workers B: It was definitely not one of your finest moments. But it's good to see that you're being responsible now and taking care of things like sending packages.\nCo-workers A: Thanks. I'm trying to be more responsible and reliable these days.\nCo-workers B: That's great to hear. It reminds me of the time when you were a great leader in your country. You were strong, determined, and made a positive impact. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nCo-worker B advises Co-worker A to be more disciplined and plan ahead for their actions.

MEMORY 1, while mentioning leadership, does not offer additional relevant context for Co-worker A's current journey of personal improvement, which is the focus of the conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
