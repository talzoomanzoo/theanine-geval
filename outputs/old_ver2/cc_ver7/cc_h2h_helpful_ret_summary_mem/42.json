    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories contain relevant information that can assist Classmates B in responding to Classmates A's inquiries about their past.

MEMORY 2, with its mention of the mysterious woman, may provide insight that Classmates B can use to discuss how they came to know about Classmates A's past, even if indirectly or through an external context.\n\nChoice: 2"
