Have you tried studying or working in a different location?\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home.\nNeighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become.\nNeighbors A: You're right, I need to stop making excuses and just get it done. Thanks for the advice.\nNeighbors B: No problem.

Building the new house was challenging but rewarding for Neighbor A.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbor A enjoys building houses and finishing them quickly.\n2. Neighbor B reminds Neighbor A of their potential to do good things, referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them.\n3. Neighbor B is looking forward to seeing the finished house and is excited about the new project.\n4. Neighbor A considers using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder.\n5. Neighbor A started construction on the house last week and plans to finish it in record time.\n6. Neighbors A helped Neighbors B build a new house with amazing features.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: In the current dialogue context, Neighbor A is talking about finishing a project, which appears to be related to the construction of the house mentioned in the previous dialogue summary. MEMORY 2 includes relevant information about Neighbor A's enjoyment of building houses, their plan to finish the house quickly, and the motivation they received from Neighbor B. It also aligns with the previous dialogue summary, reinforcing details like Neighbor A's quick construction, Neighbor B's appreciation, and the current progress of the project. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, includes a less relevant and somewhat confusing addition about plants needing sunlight, water, and love to thrive, which does not support the current dialogue context. Therefore, MEMORY 2 is more helpful in providing Neighbor A with context and motivation relevant to the ongoing house project.\n\nChoice: 2"
