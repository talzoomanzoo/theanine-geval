    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more helpful because it enumerates distinct instances of challenges and emotions the Mentee has faced, such as feeling overwhelmed, gratitude for support, and making decisions. This variety of information can help the Mentor to understand the Mentee's current feelings of loneliness in the city, her gratitude, and the stress of navigating new changes, thus providing a more contextual response. On the other hand, MEMORY 1 repeats information already understood from the summary and does not add further valuable details to assist the current situation.\n\nChoice: 2"
