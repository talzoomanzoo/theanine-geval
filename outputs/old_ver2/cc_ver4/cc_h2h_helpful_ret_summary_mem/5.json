    "prediction": "Explanation: The CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT indicates a conflict arising from Classmate A accusing Classmate B of having an affair. The helpfulness of the memory will depend on whether it provides context related to their relationship dynamics, trust, or similar past situations that could inform Classmate A's sudden accusations or the strain in their relationship. MEMORY 1 talks about Classmate A's interest in science and admiration for Classmate B's intelligence. Though it provides background on their academic interactions, it does not relate directly to the current conflict. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, covers the good relationship and romantic openness between Classmate A and B, highlighting the potential emotional stakes involved and setting a context for the unexpected accusation, making it more relevant to the current dialogue. Thus, MEMORY 2 is more aligned with providing context for the conflict.\n\nChoice: 2"
