Both MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 highlight aspects of the parent's past experiences and the supportive relationship between child and parent, but MEMORY 1 explicitly addresses the parent's reflections on making mistakes in the past and their journey to turn their life around, which aligns more closely with the theme of being heard and understood during difficult times. MEMORY 1 also mentions the parent's appreciation for small moments during tough situations, which could relate to feeling heard.\n\nChoice: 1"
