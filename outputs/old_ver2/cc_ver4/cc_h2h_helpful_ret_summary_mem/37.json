    "prediction": "Explanation: In the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT, Classmates A and B are discussing the possibility of developing a romantic relationship beyond friendship and emphasizing the importance of trust and support in their relationship. MEMORY 2 provides more relevant context as it mentions the supportive and trusting nature of their relationship (points 4 and 5), which align with the current discussion about their close connection and potential transition from friends to something more. It also highlights the support Classmate A has provided to Classmate B (point 6), which relates to Classmate A's concern about losing the friendship if they pursue something more. \n\nMEMORY 1, on the other hand, is more focused on their interactions in the formal setting of the group project and Classmate A's admiration for Classmate B's courage in sharing a secret. Although it touches on support and trust, it doesn't directly address the key emotional considerations of the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the potential transition from friends to a romantic relationship.\n\nChoice: 2"
