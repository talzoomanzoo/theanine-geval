    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains information about both Neighbors A's UFO sighting experience and their career change. While it ties to Neighbors A's past dissatisfaction with their job and a major recent lifestyle change similar to inheriting wealth, it doesn't directly relate to Neighbors A suddenly becoming a millionaire. MEMORY 2 specifically focuses on Neighbors A's dissatisfaction with their job and discusses support from Neighbors B, which aligns with Neighbors A sharing in the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT how quickly life has changed and relates more closely to finding new freedom, mirroring the newfound wealth embarkment.\n\nChoice: 2"
