    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains information about various topics, including the Mentee's job decision, feeling overwhelmed with college applications, and the shoplifting incident. However, it doesn't specifically address the Mentee's current situation of feeling lonely in a new city. MEMORY 2 focuses on college application stress, but it provides insights into the Mentor's general approach of offering reassurance and advice, which can be extrapolated to providing support for loneliness and adjustment challenges. However, neither MEMORY directly addresses the specific issue of loneliness in a new city.\n\nChoice: tie"
