I'm so glad I was able to avoid surgery. ### Neighbors B: That's great to hear! I didn't know you were dealing with back pain. How did you find the chiropractor? ### Neighbors A: A friend recommended him to me. I was skeptical at first, but I'm glad I gave it a chance. ### Neighbors B: I've never been to a chiropractor. Does it hurt? ### Neighbors A: Not at all. In fact, it's quite relaxing. They use gentle adjustments to realign your spine and joints. ### Neighbors B: Hmm, maybe I should consider it too. I've been having some neck pain lately. ### Neighbors A: It's definitely worth a try. Plus, it's a natural way to deal with pain rather than relying on medication. ### Neighbors B: That's a good point. I'll have to look into it.  ### Neighbors A: Let me know if you decide to go!

    "prediction": "Explanation: The current dialogue context revolves around Neighbor A reminiscing about their past involvement in a rock band and discussing music interests. The memories related to chiropractic care and moving to London are not directly relevant to this conversation. Since MEMORY 1 hints at shared interests in playing together but doesn't delve into music or bands, and MEMORY 2 focuses solely on chiropractic experiences, neither truly aligns with the band's topic. However, since both memories offer a foundation of Neighbor A's past experiences, their helpfulness is similar in this context.\n\nChoice: tie"
