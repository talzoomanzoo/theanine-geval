    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 directly relates to the situation involving the borrowed pencil and aligns with Co-worker A's feeling of guilt over it. It provides a specific dialogue example illustrating Co-worker B's understanding and forgiveness, which is crucial for responding to the current dialogue context about love and respect. On the other hand, MEMORY 1 provides more general information and combines various incidents, which might not be as directly useful in addressing Co-worker A's current misconception about love and actions.\n\nChoice: 2"
