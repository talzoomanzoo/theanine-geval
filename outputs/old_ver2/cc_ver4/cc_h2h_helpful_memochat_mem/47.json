    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 is more detailed about the process and challenges in building the house, as well as the relationship between Neighbors A and B. This helps to provide a more comprehensive context for the current dialogue, particularly in relation to Neighbor B's inquiry about the house project. It highlights the previous construction effort and Neighbor A's skills, which are relevant to discussing the completion of the house project. Meanwhile, MEMORY 2 focuses more on the completion and gratitude expressed after the house was finished, which occurs after the current dialogue's timeline and is less relevant in helping to address the ongoing project question.\n\nChoice: 1"
