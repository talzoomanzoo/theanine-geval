    "prediction": "Explanation: The criteria of helpfulness emphasize that the memory should contain sufficient information to respond appropriately to the current context. In the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT, Co-worker B refers to a past period of frustration experienced by Co-worker A during a movie project, highlighting the importance of support and positive reinforcement. MEMORY 1 captures the essence of the supportive and collaborative bond between the two co-workers and reflects on their mutual respect and positive influence on each other during their time on set, making it directly relevant and appropriate to the current conversation. MEMORY 2, while insightful about Co-worker A's past and self-improvement journey, does not address the specific context of Co-worker B's reference to their project experience together.\nChoice: 1"
