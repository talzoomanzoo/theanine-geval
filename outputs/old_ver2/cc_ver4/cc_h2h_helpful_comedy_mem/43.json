    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories provide context for the relationship between Neighbors A and B and their shared activities, which are relevant to the emotional support theme in the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, MEMORY 1 is more specifically focused on the emotional support that Neighbors B has provided to Neighbors A in times of grief, as seen in the details about the recent loss of Neighbors A's grandmother and finding solace in nature. This closely aligns with the current context where Neighbors A is going through a difficult time emotionally. MEMORY 2, while also helpful, is more general and includes extra details not directly relevant to the immediate emotional situation.\n\nChoice: 1"
