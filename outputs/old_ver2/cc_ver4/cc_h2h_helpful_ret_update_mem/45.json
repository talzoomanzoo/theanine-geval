    "prediction": "Explanation: The CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around Classmates A and B finding a perfect camping spot and having a conversation about how Classmate A found such a spot. MEMORY 1 provides information relevant to the camping context, as it mentions both a perfect camping spot with level ground and Classmate A's inclination toward fun activities and self-care, which may relate to the camping trip. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, delves into details about past interests and party-related concerns unrelated to camping. Therefore, MEMORY 1 is more helpful as it directly aligns with and enhances the camping situation being discussed.\n\nChoice: 1"
