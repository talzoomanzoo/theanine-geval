    "prediction": "Explanation: The current dialogue context transitions into a new topic about Classmate A's interest in carpentry. Neither memory provides direct information about carpentry. However, MEMORY 2 provides a broader perspective on the relationship dynamics between Classmate A and Classmate B, which could be useful for carrying on a personal conversation about interests and support, even if it's unrelated to carpentry. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, repeats some elements without adding new insights. \n\nChoice: 2"
