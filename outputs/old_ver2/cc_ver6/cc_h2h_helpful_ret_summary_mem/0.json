It's an important skill to have in life.\nChild: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you.\nParent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you.\nChild: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations, which causes them to mention making mistakes in the past and trying to turn their life around.\n- The Parent and Child plan to watch the sunrise together in the future, and the parent suggests repeating the sunrise-watching tradition on a future weekend.\n- The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring and is supportive and proud of their parent for making changes, offering help and reassurance if needed.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations.\n2. The child is supportive and caring towards the parent.\n3. The child offers help and reassurance to the parent.\n4. Both the parent and child express love and support for each other.\n5. The child is supportive and proud of their parent for making changes.\n6. The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The key question in the current dialogue context is whether the parent felt like nobody was really listening to them while they were in detention. MEMORY 1 mentions that the parent appreciated small moments even in difficult situations and was trying to turn their life around, which suggests they found some positivity and growth through their experience. This directly relates to the child's question about the parent's experience in detention and provides context to the parent's emotional state and perspective during that time. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 provides more general context about the supportive and loving relationship between the parent and child but lacks the specific connection to the parent's experience in detention and listening.\n\nChoice: 1"
