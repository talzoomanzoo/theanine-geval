    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a comprehensive overview of Classmates A's character and history that is consistent with the current dialogue context. The memory touches upon multiple aspects of Classmates A's past, including their determination in pursuing goals and the amusing anecdote about wearing pajamas to school, which Classmates B just mentioned in the dialogue. It also mentions Classmates A's dedication to studying and their new relationship, both relevant and seamlessly integrated into the ongoing conversation. MEMORY 1, while covering similar content, presents a slightly disjointed narrative with unnecessary details like disliking wearing a belt, which doesn't add value to the dialogue. Therefore, MEMORY 2 is more helpful and detailed in enabling a rich context for Classmates B's response.\n\nChoice: 2"
