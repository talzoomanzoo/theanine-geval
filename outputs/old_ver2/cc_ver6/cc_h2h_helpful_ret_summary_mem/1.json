    "prediction": "Explanation: The current dialogue indicates that the mentee is feeling lonely in a new city after accepting a job offer. The mentor's response needs to address this specific challenge and the emotions associated with change and loneliness. MEMORY 1 contains information about the ongoing supportive relationship, which could be relevant to providing comfort for feelings of loneliness. However, it lacks specific details related to the mentee's current situation. MEMORY 2, while including many details, mainly focuses on the stresses related to educational processes and upcoming tests, which do not directly relate to the mentee's current feeling of loneliness in a new city. Both memories do not considerably address the emotional support needed for loneliness but MEMORY 1 mentions more about the ongoing support relationship which can be leveraged in response.\n\nChoice: 1"
