    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain helpful and detailed information, enabling the Neighbors A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\nNOTE:\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is to be regarded as an unhelpful memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nNeighbors A and B live in the same neighborhood and help each other with tasks.\nNeighbors A and B are helpful towards each other.\nNeighbors B is supportive and understanding of Neighbors A's mistake.\nNeighbors B values reciprocity and acknowledges the mutual help between them as neighbors.\nNeighbors A and B have a positive and helpful relationship as neighbors.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm sorry you had to hear me swear like that. I shouldn't have lost my temper like that.\nNeighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset?\nNeighbors A: It was just something that happened at work. My boss was being unreasonable and I couldn't take it anymore.\nNeighbors B: That's understandable. Have you tried talking to your boss about it?\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I have, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I just feel like I'm stuck in a dead-end job.\nNeighbors B: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you considered looking for a new job?\nNeighbors A: I have, but with the current job market, it's really tough. Plus, I don't have a lot of experience in other fields.\nNeighbors B: Well, I'll keep an ear out for any job openings that might be a good fit for you. In the meantime, maybe try finding ways to de-stress after work? I find that exercise helps me when I'm feeling frustrated. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbor A mentioned the importance of keeping outside spaces clean and maintained for the future. This aligns with the mutual support Neighbors A and B show each other, as seen when Neighbors A helped with their lawn. Additionally, Neighbors A values appreciation and expresses gratitude for help received, highlighting the supportive and helpful dynamic between them.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbors B is supportive and understanding of Neighbors A's mistake.\n2. Neighbors A and B live in the same neighborhood and help each other with tasks.\n3. Neighbors A values appreciation and expresses gratitude for help received.\n4. Neighbors A and B are helpful towards each other.\n5. Neighbors B recalls when Neighbors A helped with their lawn, showing mutual support between them.\n6. Neighbors A and B have a positive and helpful relationship as neighbors.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a more comprehensive list of the dynamics between the neighbors, including specific points relevant to their supportive and helpful relationship. These details are consistent with the supportive and understanding nature of Neighbor B in the current conversation, as well as the broader context of their relationship. MEMORY 1, while touching on similar topics, lacks the detail and breadth that MEMORY 2 provides, which makes it less helpful in enabling Neighbor A to respond in context to the current dialogue.\n\nChoice: 2"
