    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains specific details about the dynamic between Classmates A and B, their supportive nature, and their shared experiences with past events and growth. However, it introduces unrelated topics like dancing in middle school, which do not contribute to the current conversation on learning from a computer course. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 provides a concise summary of their friendship, support, and personal growth, which aligns well with the context of sharing new knowledge from a computer course. Additionally, it does not introduce unrelated topics, making it more relevant to the current dialogue.\n\nChoice: 2"
