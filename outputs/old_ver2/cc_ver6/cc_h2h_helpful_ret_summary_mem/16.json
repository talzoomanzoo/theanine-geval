    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains helpful information about Co-worker A's past feelings of stress concerning their relationship with Co-worker B, which aligns directly with the current dialogue where Co-worker A reflects on past stress about Co-worker B not liking them. This reinforces the narrative and provides context for Co-worker B to understand and respond empathetically to Co-worker A's recollection of past stress. MEMORY 2, while providing some relevant information about leadership aspirations, does not connect as strongly to the specific concern Co-worker A raises about their past relationship stress with Co-worker B.\n\nChoice: 1"
