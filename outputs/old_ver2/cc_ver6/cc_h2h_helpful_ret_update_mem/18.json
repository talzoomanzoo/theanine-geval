    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 contains concise and relevant information about Neighbors A's career change and Neighbors B's support, which aligns with the current dialogue context of discussing recent life changes and newfound freedom after becoming a millionaire. It provides detailed information about past discussions and supports that fit directly into the context of potentially starting a new business or further career development with the inherited funds. MEMORY 1, however, introduces unrelated elements like UFO sightings and weekend plans, which detract from the core relevance and help of Neighbors A's millionaire status and future plans.\n\nChoice: 2"
