    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 contains several elements that are directly relevant and helpful to the current dialogue context. Notably, it draws links to the husbandâ€™s nervousness before his fifth-grade presentation and encourages him to embrace his unique qualities, which is reinforced by the wife's current encouragement for the husband to take risks in his writing. This memory aligns well with the wife's current advice to try something new in his writing. It also brings up a previous reference to adjusting communication for better understanding, echoing the wife's support and willingness to engage in creative discussions with the husband. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, contains more extraneous information about movies and modern language that does not directly align with the current situation about writing challenges.\n\nChoice: 2"
