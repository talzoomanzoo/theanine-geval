    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides a more focused and detailed context regarding Neighbors A's work situation and the advice they received from Neighbors B. It directly mentions the need for self-improvement and taking responsibility, which aligns well with the previous dialogue summary where Neighbors A acknowledges the need to improve their work behavior. MEMORY 2, while it includes similar elements of support and behavior improvement, also adds less relevant details about coffee and chatting, which do not contribute to the current dialogue about work progress. Thus, MEMORY 1 is more helpful in keeping the context centered around the relevant issues.\n\nChoice: 1"
