    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 focuses more on a past incident where Neighbor A showed appreciation for Neighbor B's actions and ordered pizza, as well as the transition to discussing Neighbor A's daughter starting high school. However, it lacks some details from the current dialogue context, particularly about the past embarrassment and the park. MEMORY 2 aligns more effectively with the current dialogue, emphasizing the park incident, the past embarrassment, and the reassurance about their friendship. It provides context about the past issues and their friendship, which is directly relevant to the conversation about stress and moving past their history.\n\nChoice: 2"
