    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a more detailed account of the specific experience Co-worker A shared about being led by a commander to safety. This detailed recollection matches closely with the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Co-worker A acknowledges the impact of that guidance on their leadership approach. It also complements the focus on leadership and guidance discussed in the dialogue. Conversely, MEMORY 1, while containing some related themes such as fulfillment and leadership, does not provide as direct a connection to the specific experience mentioned in the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 2"
