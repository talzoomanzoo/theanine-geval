    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 provides information about Co-worker A's progression and how Co-worker B appreciates this change, which aligns well with the current dialogue's theme of Co-worker A reflecting on past irresponsibility and sharing positive developments. It also highlights Co-worker A's adjustment to the night shift and promotion, which Co-worker A mentions in the current dialogue. Memory 2 focuses more on reflecting on past mistakes and the specific incident involving Co-worker B's arrest. It doesn't directly link to the current positive development shared by Co-worker A.\n\nChoice: 1"
