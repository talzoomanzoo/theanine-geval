What happened? ### Parent: Well, I got into some trouble with the law. I feel scared and upset right now. ### Child: I'm sorry to hear that. Do you know how long you will have to stay there? ### Parent: Not yet. That's something I'm trying to figure out. ### Child: Is there anything I can do to help? ### Parent: Just knowing that you're thinking of me and supporting me means a lot. Thank you. ### Child: Of course, Dad. I love you. ### Parent: I love you too, kiddo. And I'm sorry for any pain that my actions may have caused you. ### Child: It's okay, Dad. Everyone makes mistakes. We'll get through this together. ### Parent: That means a lot to me, son. Thank you. ### Parent: I remember waking up early one morning while I was in juvenile detention. I couldn't see the sunrise from my cell, but I still felt hopeful that things would get better. ### Child: That must have been tough, not having the freedom to just go outside and watch the sunrise. ### Parent: It was. But I learned to appreciate the small moments and find hope even in the darkest of situations. ### Child: That's really inspiring, Parent. Did you ever get to see the sunrise when you got out of detention? ### Parent: I did. One morning, I woke up early and went outside to watch the sunrise. It was a reminder to me that there is always a new day and a chance to start fresh. ### Child: That's so beautiful.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a detailed account of the parent's juvenile detention experience, including their feelings of fear and upset, as well as moments of finding hope. It directly addresses the child's question about feeling unheard while in detention and provides context for the parent's reflections on listening and hope in difficult situations. This makes it highly relevant and helpful for the current dialogue. MEMORY 1, though positive and supportive, lacks specific information about the detention experience that would help the parent respond to the child's question about feeling heard in detention.\n\nChoice: 2"
