    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains information directly related to the previous dialogue and the current context by highlighting the bond and mutual respect developed during their collaboration on the movie set. It reflects how their past collaboration influences their current professional relationships and contributes to the feeling of gratitude Co-worker A has toward supportive figures, such as bosses. This aligns well with the current dialogue where Co-worker A expresses gratitude for supportive leadership. MEMORY 2, while interesting, introduces unrelated topics such as fears and frustrations that do not directly contribute to the context of feeling motivated by supportive leadership in the workplace.\n\nChoice: 1"
