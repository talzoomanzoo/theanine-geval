    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 is more focused on the talent of Co-worker A for solving mysteries, which aligns with Co-worker B's reference to Co-worker A's surprising skills in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It connects the conversation about Co-worker A's singing talent with their previously displayed mystery-solving ability, which Co-worker B brings up. This is directly relevant and useful for continuing the conversation in context.
