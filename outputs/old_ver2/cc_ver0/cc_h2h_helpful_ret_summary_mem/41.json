Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking?\nCo-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for asking me to join you.\nCo-workers A: No problem, it'll be great to catch up. Hey, do you remember when we talked about me being irresponsible a few years ago?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, I remember that conversation. What about it?\nCo-workers A: Well, I wanted to share some good news with you. I've been recently promoted to the night shift and have been doing a great job. I think I've come a long way since those days. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nCo-worker A has made mistakes in the past but is trying to be more aware of their actions, which leads to Co-worker B moving on from their arrest and appreciating Co-worker A's concern and change in behavior. This reminds Co-worker B of Co-worker A's progress and potential for success. Co-worker A is adjusting to the night shift schedule and excited for a promotion.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker B reminds Co-worker A of their progress and potential for success.\n2. Co-worker A is adjusting to the night shift schedule and excited for a promotion.\n3. Co-worker B has moved on from their arrest and appreciates Co-worker A's concern and change in behavior.\n4. Co-worker B reassures Co-worker A and encourages them to have more confidence.\n5. Co-workers A and B have worked together on a big story in the past.\n6. Co-worker A is a journalist who was recently promoted for being reliable.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides a more focused and relevant description of Co-worker A's journey from past irresponsibility to their current success, which is the topic introduced in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Co-worker A's promotion and their adjustment to the night shift, directly linked to the conversation. MEMORY 2 includes additional information unrelated to the current dialogue, such as Co-worker B's arrest and past work on a story, which might not be immediately relevant. MEMORY 1's concise focus on Co-worker A's personal growth is more helpful for Co-worker B to respond appropriately to Co-worker A's good news.\n\nChoice: 1"
