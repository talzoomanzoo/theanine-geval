    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context revolves around Classmates A discussing their recent computer course and asking for software recommendations. Memory 2 focuses on the supportive nature of the friendship between Classmates A and B, which could be relevant if Classmate B wanted to ask for or offer help regarding the software recommendations. Memory 1 contains similar supportive elements but also includes unrelated details about a mistake and dancing from middle school, which distracts from the current topic. \n\nChoice: 2"
