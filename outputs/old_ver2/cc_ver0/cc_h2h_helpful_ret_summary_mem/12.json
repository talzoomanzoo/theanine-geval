    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant about the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, enabling the Classmates B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today.\nClassmates B:  That sounds great. What was the talk about?\nClassmates A: It was about the history of the pyramids in Egypt. I learned so much about their construction and the cultural significance they held.\nClassmates B: Wow, that does sound interesting. Did you take any notes?\nClassmates A: Yes, I took lots of notes. I'm excited to study this topic more on my own time.\nClassmates B: That's awesome. It's great to see your enthusiasm for learning.\nClassmates A: Thanks. I've always been passionate about learning new things. Remember when we talked about how determined I was to get into college?\nClassmates B: Yeah, I remember. You were always studying and taking extra classes.\nClassmates A: And now, after all that hard work, I am actually in college. It just goes to show that with dedication, you can achieve your goals.\nClassmates B: That's so inspiring. It also reminds me of when you wore your pajamas to school. You were always doing something different and unique.\nClassmates A: Haha, yeah, I remember that. But hey, being a little weird sometimes adds some fun and excitement to life. Speaking of exciting things, I met the girl of my dreams a couple of years ago at a party. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- Classmates A had a moment of frustration in the past but has learned to channel that energy into studies, which caused them to show up to school in pajamas due to oversleeping after studying late.\n- Classmates A met the girl of their dreams at a party and have been texting her nonstop, which made them take off their belt and dislike wearing it all day.\n- Classmates A is dedicated to studying hard and taking extra classes to get into a good college, wanting to work hard to achieve their dreams, and not being afraid to be themselves and embracing their quirks, which their girlfriend appreciates.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Classmates B recalls a funny moment from high school involving Classmates A wearing pajamas to school.\n2. Classmates A met the girl of their dreams at a party and have been texting her nonstop.\n3. Classmates A is dedicated to studying hard and taking extra classes to get into a good college.\n4. Classmates A is determined to make the relationship work, similar to their determination to get into college.\n5. Classmates A is willing to work hard to achieve their dreams.\n6. Classmates A had a moment of frustration in the past but has learned to channel that energy into studies.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: In the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, Classmates A mentions achieving their goal of getting into college and also refers to meeting the girl of their dreams at a party. The MEMORY should provide relevant background information for Classmates B to naturally continue the conversation on these topics. MEMORY 2 is more helpful as it contains concise information on both Classmates A's determination to achieve their goals (like getting into college) and their current relationship (texting the girl they met at a party), which gives Classmates B more context to engage with both topics. MEMORY 1 includes an irrelevant detail about a belt, which does not contribute to the ongoing discussion and could detract from the focus on goals and relationships.\n\nChoice: 2"
