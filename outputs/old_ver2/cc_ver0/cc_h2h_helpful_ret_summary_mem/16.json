I was promoted to product manager!\nCo-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge.\nCo-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail.\nCo-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of new products, remember when you used to fantasize about being a great leader?\nCo-workers A: Ha, yeah. That seems like ages ago.\nCo-workers B: Well, now you can finally take on that leadership role and make your dreams a reality.\nCo-workers A: That's true. It's amazing how life works out sometimes. But it hasn't always been smooth sailing. Remember when I was really stressed about you not liking me? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. [Co-worker A used to fantasize about being a great leader and being respected and admired.] - (SameTopic) - [Co-worker A has aspirations of being a great leader and emphasizes the importance of communication.]\n2. [Co-worker A has fantasies of being a great leader.] - (SameTopic) - [Co-worker A felt stressed about their relationship with Co-worker B in the past.] - (Causes) - [Co-worker B advises Co-worker A to control their emotions and discuss the issue with Co-worker B.]\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker B encourages Co-worker A to consider pursuing a leadership position and highlights the qualities of a good leader.\n2. Co-worker A used to fantasize about being a great leader and being respected and admired.\n3. Co-worker A has fantasies of being a great leader.\n4. Co-worker A has grown and become more confident over the years.\n5. Co-worker A considers taking on more responsibility at work as a start towards being a leader.\n6. Co-worker B acknowledges and supports Co-worker A's growth and progress.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context highlights Co-worker A's journey from fantasizing about being a leader to actually taking on a leadership role. It ends with Co-worker A recalling a time they were stressed about Co-worker B's perception of them. MEMORY 1 is more helpful because it directly addresses this past stress between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, which is relevant for Co-worker B's response. The mention of advising Co-worker A to control emotions and discuss the issue also ties into Co-worker A's past stress, which is relevant to the final utterance in the dialogue context. This makes it more relevant and useful than MEMORY 2, which focuses more broadly on leadership qualities and progression.\n\nChoice: 1"
