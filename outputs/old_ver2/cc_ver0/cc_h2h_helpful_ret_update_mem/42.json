    "prediction": "Explanation: In the given dialogue context, Classmates A is seeking information about their past from Classmates B. Classmates B is hesitant to disclose anything, citing it is not their place to tell. The points from MEMORY 1 mainly focus on the relationship dynamics between Classmates A and B, emphasizing positivity, resilience, and mutual appreciation, which are not directly relevant or helpful to the specific situation of disclosure of sensitive information. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, presents Classmates A's curiosity and risk-taking nature, which might be relevant if Classmates B could tie the mysterious past to such characteristics or any experiences Classmates A might have sought after. Also, MEMORY 2 mentions Classmates A's encounter with a mysterious woman in a dark alley, which might relate to the past Classmates A is inquiring about. These elements from MEMORY 2 could help Classmates B in framing an appropriate response or context around the request for disclosing past information.\nChoice: 2"
