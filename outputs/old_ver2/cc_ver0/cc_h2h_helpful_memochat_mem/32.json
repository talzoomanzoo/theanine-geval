    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more relevant and useful for the given dialogue context. It contains information about past experiences and the importance of support, which ties in directly with the current conversation where Classmates A is comforting Classmates B about the recent embarrassing incident. It shows that Classmates A has also had embarrassing experiences and they share mutual support, which is pertinent to the dialogue. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, talks about resilience, quick thinking, and giving effort, which does not directly relate to the theme of the current conversation about embarrassment and support.\n\nChoice: 2"
