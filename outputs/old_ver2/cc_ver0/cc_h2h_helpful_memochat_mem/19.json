I shouldn't have lost my temper like that.\nNeighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset?\nNeighbors A: It was just something that happened at work. My boss was being unreasonable and I couldn't take it anymore.\nNeighbors B: That's understandable. Have you tried talking to your boss about it?\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I have, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I just feel like I'm stuck in a dead-end job.\nNeighbors B: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you considered looking for a new job?\nNeighbors A: I have, but with the current job market, it's really tough. Plus, I don't have a lot of experience in other fields.\nNeighbors B: Well, I'll keep an ear out for any job openings that might be a good fit for you.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 connects directly to the dialogue context by referencing topics of making mistakes and managing frustration, which are directly relevant to Neighbors A's current feelings about being stuck in a dead-end job and dealing with a difficult boss. This memory allows Neighbors B to empathize further, potentially offering advice based on past experiences shared between the neighbors. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, does not relate to the immediate issue of job frustration, making it less helpful in this context.\n\nChoice: 2"
