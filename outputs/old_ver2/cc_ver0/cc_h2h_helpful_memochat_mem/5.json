Neither memory provides specific information about the affair or conflict. However, MEMORY 1 provides context regarding Classmates A's admiration for Classmates B and their desire to be friends and study partners, which is more relevant in understanding the emotional background. MEMORY 2, while detailing career aspirations, lacks relevance to the current emotional context and relationship dynamics between the classmates.\n\nChoice: 1"
