    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 2 provides additional context about Classmates A and B's relationship, indicating they have a supportive and encouraging bond. It also references an enjoyable social interaction (discussing a concert), which might give Classmate B an opportunity to remind Classmate A of their positive shared experiences and possibly defuse the tension with companionship reminders. The mention of past social interactions supports the idea that Classmates A's reaction could be stemming from misunderstanding rather than established animosity. Memory 1, while providing information about their study interests and admiration, lacks sufficient context-specific information about their personal interactions that could be leveraged in this emotionally charged situation.\n\nChoice: 2"
