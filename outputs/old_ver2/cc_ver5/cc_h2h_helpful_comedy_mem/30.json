That was because I wanted to make a small impact, like you did for your neighbor. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a detailed description of the relationship dynamics between Classmates A and B, as well as past events that align closely with the contents of the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, such as resolving mix-ups and acknowledging Classmates B's reliability and responsibility. This information is directly relevant to the discussion about making a positive impact, as Classmates B connects their efforts in resolving the mix-up to the same values of kindness and responsibility that Classmates A demonstrated with their neighbor. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, focuses more on personal safety and opinions, which are not mentioned in the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Therefore, MEMORY 2 is more helpful in enabling Classmates A to respond appropriately.\n\nChoice: 2"
