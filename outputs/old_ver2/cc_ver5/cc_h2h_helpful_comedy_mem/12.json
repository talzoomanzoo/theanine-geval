    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides helpful context specifically related to Classmates A meeting \"the girl of their dreams at a party and have been texting her nonstop,\" which ties back to the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY and the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Classmates A mentions meeting the girl of their dreams. This allows Classmates B to respond appropriately in the context of A's previous relationship revelation. MEMORY 2 lacks this specific relationship information and is more focused on academic achievements and descriptions unrelated to the party or the girl.\n\nChoice: 1"
