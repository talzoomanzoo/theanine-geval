    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 contains details about Neighbor A's past experiences with the chiropractor and their move to London, which align with the previous dialogue summary and provide relevant context for the conversation. While these details are not directly related to the current context about Neighbor A's music band, they do provide some background about Neighbor A's life journey, which could potentially relate to themes of stress management or life changes. Memory 2 focuses mainly on the supportive relationship and consideration between the neighbors, which is consistent with the previous dialogue but doesn't add specific useful information to the ongoing conversation theme about Neighbor A's musical past. As Memory 1 gives more background information that might enhance the conversation, it holds more potential helpfulness.\n\nChoice: 1"
