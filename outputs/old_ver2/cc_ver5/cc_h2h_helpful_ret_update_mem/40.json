However, MEMORY 1 directly highlights Classmates B as a supportive friend and ties that back to Classmates A acknowledging mistakes, which ties more directly into their conversation about learning and making recommendations. It emphasizes the supportive role of Classmates B and their interest in learning, which can relate to software selection in the current conversation. \n\nChoice: 1"
