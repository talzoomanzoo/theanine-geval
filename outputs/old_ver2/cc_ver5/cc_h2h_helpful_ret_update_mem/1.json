    "prediction": "Explanation: \nMemory 2 is more helpful because it contains a point about the mentee expressing gratitude for the mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process (point 4), which ties in with their reliance on the mentor when feeling lonely or when new challenges arise. Additionally, Memory 2 includes relevant points such as the mentee feeling overwhelmed with the decision-making process in the past and the mentor's reassurance (points 1 and 3). Memory 1 has more tangential and less relevant information, such as the incident with shoes, which is not relevant to the current issue of loneliness.\n\nChoice: 2"
