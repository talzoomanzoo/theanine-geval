PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is not helpful in that context.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nCo-worker A was a leader in their country, making it prosperous and safe.\nCo-worker A believes their success as a leader was due to determination and strength of character.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today?\nCo-workers B: No, you didn't. What did you do there?\nCo-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done.\nCo-workers B: That's good. I hate going to the post office. It's always so crowded.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it was pretty busy today. But I needed to get this package sent out.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of packages, remember that time when you got stranded because you couldn't drive yourself home from a night out with friends?\nCo-workers A: Ugh, don't remind me. That was such a disaster.\nCo-workers B: It was definitely not one of your finest moments. But it's good to see that you're being responsible now and taking care of things like sending packages.\nCo-workers A: Thanks. I'm trying to be more responsible and reliable these days.\nCo-workers B: That's great to hear. It reminds me of the time when you were a great leader in your country. You were strong, determined, and made a positive impact. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nCo-worker B advises Co-worker A to be more disciplined and plan ahead for their actions. This reminds Co-worker A of the time when they were a leader in their country, making it prosperous and safe.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker A is trying to be more responsible but still working on avoiding late nights out and expensive rides.\n2. Co-worker A is trying to improve their punctuality and cut back on drinking.\n3. Co-worker B is aware of Co-worker A's struggles with late nights out and expensive Uber rides.\n4. Co-worker B is concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits.\n5. Both co-workers show a supportive and caring attitude towards each other.\n6. Co-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to give people a chance.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 2 is more helpful in this context because it aligns with the ongoing discussion about Co-worker A's efforts to be more responsible. It provides additional insights into Co-worker A's journey towards responsibility, such as avoiding late nights out and expensive rides, struggles with punctuality, and efforts to cut back on drinking. It also emphasizes the supportive relationship between the co-workers, which is relevant to the dialogue where Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's improvement and relates it to their past leadership qualities. Memory 1, while mentioning Co-worker A's past leadership, does not provide as much context-specific information about their current efforts and the supportive dynamic between the co-workers.\n\nChoice: 2"
