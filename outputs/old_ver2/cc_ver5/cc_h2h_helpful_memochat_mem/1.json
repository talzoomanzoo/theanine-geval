MEMORY 2, despite being centered around college application stress, contains a strong theme of mentor support and self-care advice. Although MEMORY 2 does not directly deal with loneliness, the notion of self-care can relate to the Mentee's current situation. However, neither memory directly addresses the core issue of loneliness and making new friends.\n\nChoice: 2"
