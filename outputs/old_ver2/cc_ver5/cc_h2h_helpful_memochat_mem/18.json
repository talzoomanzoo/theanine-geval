    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 includes information about Neighbors B's supportive behavior in relation to both the job change and the newfound wealth of Neighbors A, and it also aligns well with the previous dialogue context of Neighbors A making a big career change and being much happier. MEMORY 2, while it contains relevant information about career change, is more focused on the initial dissatisfaction and plan for job change rather than any connection to wealth or previous achievement. Additionally, MEMORY 1 incorporates Neighbors A becoming a millionaire, their reaction, and the intended usage of the inherited money, making it more comprehensive and directly connected to the current conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
