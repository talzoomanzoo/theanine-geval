PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is not helpful in that context.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nClassmates A and B have been on field trips to other planets or moons before, like Mars.\nClassmate A showed determination in fixing their spaceship after it was damaged in a meteor shower.\nClassmate A's perseverance in repairing the spaceship reflects their determination to not give up in challenging situations.\nClassmate A is patient and helpful in teaching driving material to Classmate B.\nBoth classmates value supporting and uplifting each other in their learning and growth.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Why is your face so red and splotchy, Classmates B?

I won't judge you, I promise.\nClassmates B: Well, I accidentally spilled my lunch all over myself in front of some people.\nClassmates A: (laughs) That's it? That's why you're embarrassed? I thought it was something serious.\nClassmates B: (sighs) Yeah, it's silly. But still embarrassing.\nClassmates A: Don't worry about it. It happens to everyone. Remember the time I tripped and fell in front of the whole class during our presentation?\nClassmates B: Oh yeah, that was pretty bad. But you handled it so well. You just got up, dusted yourself off, and continued with the presentation. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Classmates A praised Classmates B for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.\n2.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides more relevant and sufficient background information about Classmates A and B's attitudes, such as resilience, quick thinking, and effort, which can be linked to Classmate A's previous experiences of handling embarrassment. This information can be supportive and motivational for Classmate B in overcoming their current embarrassment. MEMORY 2 focuses more broadly on past trips and support in tough times, which is less directly related to the specific current dialogue context about handling embarrassment.\n\nChoice: 1"
