    "prediction": "Explanation: When determining helpfulness, MEMORY 2 directly addresses the current feeling of job unfulfillment that Neighbor A has expressed and contains a relevant past conversation related to Neighbor A's desire to make a bigger impact and possibly explore new opportunities. This aligns well with the last utterance in the dialogue context where Neighbor B brings up the topic of Neighbor A's job again. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, focuses more on interests like cooking and telekinesis, which are not directly related to the job dissatisfaction topic discussed in both the previous and current dialogue context. Thus, MEMORY 2 provides more relevant information for the ongoing conversation about job concerns.\n\nChoice: 2"
