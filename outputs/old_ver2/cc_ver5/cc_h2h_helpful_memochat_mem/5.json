    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither MEMORY 1 nor MEMORY 2 directly addresses the current conflict between Classmates A and B regarding the alleged affair. However, both memories provide background on their relationship and study partnership. MEMORY 2 includes direct dialogue that serves as evidence of their supportive relationship, which may be relevant to understand why Classmates B responds with \"I thought we were friends.\" This provides a little more insight into their relationship dynamic than MEMORY 1.\n\nChoice: 2"
