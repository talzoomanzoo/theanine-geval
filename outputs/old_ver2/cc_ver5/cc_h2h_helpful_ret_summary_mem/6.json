    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain sufficient quantity of useful information, enabling the Neighbors A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT. PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is not helpful in that context.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nNeighbor A is feeling unfulfilled with their job and wants to make a bigger impact.\nNeighbor A is considering looking for a new job but is unsure of what they want to do.\nNeighbor A feels there is no room for growth or new projects at their current job.\nNeighbor B suggests that new skills could lead to new opportunities in Neighbor A's current job or future career.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey, can you keep a secret?\nNeighbors B: Of course, what's up?\nNeighbors A: I can't be seen because I am hiding from my mom behind the door.\nNeighbors B: Oh, why are you hiding from her?\nNeighbors A: She wants me to go to a family dinner tonight, but I'm too tired and just want to relax at home.\nNeighbors B: Maybe you should talk to her about it and let her know how you feel.\nNeighbors A: I know, but I don't want to disappoint her.\nNeighbors B: It's important to take care of your own needs and speak up for yourself. Plus, maybe you can compromise and go to the dinner for a little while and then come back home to relax.\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, thanks for the advice.\nNeighbors B: No problem. Speaking of compromise, remember that dinner we went to a few days ago?\nNeighbors A: Yes, it was so much fun!\nNeighbors B: I'm glad you enjoyed it. Maybe we can make it a regular thing and try out new restaurants together.\nNeighbors A: That sounds great! And it gives me something to look forward to after work.\nNeighbors B: Speaking of work, how are you feeling about your job lately? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbors A enjoys cooking and made roasted vegetables and quinoa for dinner.

Neighbors A and B are discussing the idea of having telekinetic abilities. Neighbor B suggests that new skills could lead to new opportunities in Neighbor A's current job or future career.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbor B offers support and suggests planning a dinner to celebrate Neighbor A's new adventures in learning.\n2. Neighbors B is interested in Neighbors A's cooking and asks about the vegetables and quinoa preparation.\n3. Neighbors B is excited and supportive of Neighbors A's new ability.\n4. Neighbors A enjoys trying new things, like new recipes.\n5. Neighbors A made a roasted vegetable and quinoa dish that Neighbors B enjoyed.\n6. Neighbors B is open to trying new recipes and is excited to receive the chickpea curry recipe from Neighbors A.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains references not only to cooking and future dinners, but also mentions the beneficial aspect of gaining new skills, which directly ties back to the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY where Neighbor B suggests new skills could lead to new opportunities in Neighbor A's current job or future career. This detail about learning and growth is relevant to the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT as Neighbor B asks about Neighbor A's feelings about her job, providing a bridge between discussing personal interests and professional development.\n\nMEMORY 2, while it does mention cooking and shared interest in trying new recipes, does not explicitly mention learning new skills in relation to career growth, thus missing the link back to the ongoing job satisfaction and career impact considerations from both dialogues.\n\nChoice: 1"
