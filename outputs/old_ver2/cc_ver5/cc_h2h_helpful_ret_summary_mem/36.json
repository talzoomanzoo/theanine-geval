    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more helpful as it provides relevant information supporting the idea of the reciprocity and mutual assistance between the neighbors, which is the focus of the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Neighbors A thanking Neighbors B for suggestions, which fits well with how Neighbors A and Neighbors B reciprocated help to each other in the past (e.g., helping with the move, watching the cat). This MEMORY also highlights the importance of showing care in relationships, aligning with the current dialogue's focus on mutual support and being there for each other.\n\nChoice: 2"
