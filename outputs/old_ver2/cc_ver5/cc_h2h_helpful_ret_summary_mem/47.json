    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a detailed overview of Neighbor A's enjoyment in building houses and completing them quickly, which aligns with the previous dialog summary. It also mentions Neighbor B's excitement and anticipation for the finished project, which is pertinent to the current query about the house project progress. Additionally, it explains how Neighbor A considers using their skills for good, referencing Neighbor B's motivation, which correlates with Neighbor A's current challenge with procrastination and motivation to get things done. MEMORY 1, while similar, includes irrelevant content about plant care and manipulation skills, which distracts from the helpful context needed to respond.\n\nChoice: 2"
