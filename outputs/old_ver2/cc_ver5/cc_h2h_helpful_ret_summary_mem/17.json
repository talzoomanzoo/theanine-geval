    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more aligned with the current dialogue context as it includes points relevant to the previous interactions between Neighbors A and B, particularly about the park they found together a few years ago, which aligns with Neighbors B's recollection in the current dialogue. It also matches the friendly, supportive relationship dynamic that is depicted in the current conversation. Meanwhile, MEMORY 1 introduces new topics like the cheese pizza or Neighbors A's daughter starting high school, which are irrelevant to the current context. \n\nChoice: 2"
