PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is not helpful in that context.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nThe parent was taken to juvenile detention for getting into trouble with the law.\nThe parent expresses fear and upset about the situation.\nThe parent had a tough time when they got arrested and had to rely on a lawyer and the justice system for help.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life.\nChild: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you.\nParent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you.\nChild: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations, which causes them to mention making mistakes in the past and trying to turn their life around.\n- The Parent and Child plan to watch the sunrise together in the future, and the parent suggests repeating the sunrise-watching tradition on a future weekend.\n- The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring and is supportive and proud of their parent for making changes, offering help and reassurance if needed.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations.\n2. The child is supportive and caring towards the parent.\n3. The child offers help and reassurance to the parent.\n4. Both the parent and child express love and support for each other.\n5. The child is supportive and proud of their parent for making changes.\n6. The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains additional useful information about the Parent mentioning their past mistakes and efforts to turn their life around, which is relevant to the child’s question about the Parent’s feelings during detention. This insight could give the Parent a context to explain their feelings and relate their past experiences to their current values, such as listening. In contrast, MEMORY 2 contains generally supportive and positive details but lacks specific mention of the Parent’s reflection on their past mistakes, which directly ties into the current dialogue.\n\nChoice: 1"
