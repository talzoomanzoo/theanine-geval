    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain sufficient quantity of useful information, enabling the Co-workers A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT. PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is not helpful in that context.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nCo-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument.\nCo-worker B is supportive and interested in the evidence collected by Co-worker A.\nCo-worker A's evidence includes statistics and personal accounts from clients.\nCo-worker A believes their evidence is more compelling than the opposing side's evidence.\nCo-worker A plans to present the evidence clearly and persuasively in court.\nCo-worker A has presented evidence in front of a judge to support their position in the past.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message.\nCo-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of skills, you always present a compelling argument in debates. I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument. This experience has led to Co-worker A presenting evidence in front of a judge to support their position in the past, where they denied that their reputation had any impact on Karen giving them the money.\n   \n2. Co-worker A plans to present the evidence clearly and persuasively in court, which has already changed to Co-worker A having presented evidence in front of a judge to support their position in the past. In that instance, Co-worker A denied that their reputation had any impact on Karen giving them the money.\n   \n3. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument. This has led Co-worker B to commend Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs, resulting in Co-worker A being willing to take on the project of building a deck for Co-worker B.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker A plans to present the evidence clearly and persuasively in court.\n2. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument.\n3. Co-worker A has presented evidence in front of a judge to support their position in the past.\n4. Co-worker B commends Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs.\n5. Co-worker A's evidence includes statistics and personal accounts from clients.\n6. Co-worker B is supportive and interested in the evidence collected by Co-worker A.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 contains more detailed and relevant information that supports the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures Co-worker B’s supportive nature and compliments, Co-worker A’s confidence, past experiences, and capabilities in presenting evidence, all of which align with the context of discussing speaking skills and presenting arguments. MEMORY 1 includes some irrelevant elements such as the mention of a deck construction project and brings in a potentially conflicting detail about denying a reputation impact, which does not align well with the supportive and confident tone of the current dialogue.\n\nChoice: 2"
