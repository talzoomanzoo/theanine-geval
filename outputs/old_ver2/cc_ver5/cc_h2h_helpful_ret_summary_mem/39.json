    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 explicitly includes information about Classmates A's arm pain, noting that they experienced a muscle strain but did not go to the hospital. This directly relates to and provides context for Classmates A's comment about their arm pain in the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Also, Memory 1 includes acknowledgment from Classmates B about the arm issue and suggests getting it checked out, which aligns with the discussion of determination and health concerns mentioned in the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY. In contrast, MEMORY 2 lacks any mention of the arm pain or health concerns, which reduces its helpfulness in responding to the current context regarding Classmates A's mention of waiting for arm pain to subside.\n\nChoice: 1"
