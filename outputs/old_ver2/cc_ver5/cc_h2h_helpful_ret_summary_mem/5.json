    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a broad view of the relationship between Classmates A and B, highlighting points like a mutual interest in biology, a potential romantic connection, and shared views and enjoyment of each other's company. It aligns with the previous dialogue about exploring a romantic connection and expresses that Classmates A and B have a good relationship. It also touches on the emotional context, like A's crush, which can add depth to understanding their current conflict about the alleged affair. On the other hand, MEMORY 1 mainly focuses on Classmates A's passion for science and admiration for Classmates B. While it does capture some essential elements, MEMORY 2 is more comprehensive and therefore more helpful in addressing the current dialogue's conflict.\n\nChoice: 2"
