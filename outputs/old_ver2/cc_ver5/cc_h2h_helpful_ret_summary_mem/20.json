    "prediction": "Explanation: Both MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 contain the relevant information that Co-worker A has \"Sherlock Holmes-like skills\" and enjoys solving mysteries, aligning with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY. Both memories suggest Co-worker A has a talent for solving puzzles and mysteries and considered becoming a detective. However, MEMORY 2 has an additional piece of information about Co-worker B being surprised when Co-worker A discovered they were married, which could be an additional useful context for Co-worker B referring to Co-worker A's skills in the current dialogue. Despite this, the additional point is not directly relevant to the current situation, which is focused on Co-worker A's unexpected singing talent. Therefore the additional information in MEMORY 2 neither adds nor detracts in helpfulness for this particular context over MEMORY 1.\n\nChoice: tie"
