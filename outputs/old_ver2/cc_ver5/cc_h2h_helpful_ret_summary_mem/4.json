    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more helpful because it directly aligns with the optimistic and supportive interaction between the co-workers in the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It emphasizes mutual support, motivation, and excitement about future collaboration, which resonates with the tone of the present conversation. MEMORY 1 introduces off-topic elements like borrowing a horse, which do not contribute to the relevant elaboration of team support and partnership anticipation seen in the current dialogue.\n\nChoice: 2"
