    "prediction": "Explanation: In the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT, the mentee expresses feelings of loneliness after moving to a new city. MEMORY 1 contains information about the current situation in the city (point 3), gratitude for the Mentor's support (point 2), and feeling overwhelmed, which aligns with the mentee's current emotional state and could be addressed by the Mentor. However, MEMORY 2 gives a broader context but focuses more on issues not currently relevant (college applications, SAT, and store incident), which do not directly relate to the mentee's feelings of loneliness and needing interpersonal connections in the new city.\nChoice: 1"
