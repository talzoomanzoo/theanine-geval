    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 2 provides a comprehensive overview of past interactions and present emotions, which align well with the current dialogue context. It reiterates the husband's apology and commitment to involving the wife in his plans, acknowledges past impatience, and highlights the wife's role in inspiring the husband to take action on his goals. This information is well-suited to help navigate the husband's desire to make up for his past mistake and shows understanding of the dynamics involved in planning their getaway. On the other hand, Memory 1 is more general and does not specifically address the motivating factors for the husband's actions or the wife's influence, making it less helpful for addressing the current interaction effectively.\n\nChoice: 2"
