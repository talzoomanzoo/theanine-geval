As friends who help each other with schoolwork, Classmates A and Classmates B have a strong bond.\n- Classmates B emphasizes the consequences of Classmates A's actions and the need for responsibility.

Classmates A has matured since then and learned from past mistakes.\n6. Classmate A appreciates having friends who are there for them during difficult times.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 contain similar information about the supportive friendship between Classmates A and B, their past experiences, and the dynamic of learning from mistakes. However, MEMORY 1 includes additional context about how previous interactions with Classmate B have emphasized the consequences of actions and the importance of responsibility. This is directly relevant to the current dialogue context, where Classmate B is asking for specific software recommendations, implying a readiness to learn something new from Classmate A's recent course completion. This aligns with past interactions of learning and growth, making MEMORY 1 more time-sensitive and relevant.\n\nChoice: 1"
