    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides details that include Classmates A's moment of frustration and the connection between them disliking wearing a belt and texting. However, MEMORY 2 is more aligned with the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT as it includes the story about Classmates A's determination to get into college, which was a significant point discussed in the conversation. It also correctly recalls the funny moment when Classmates A wore pajamas to school, which Classmates B also mentioned in the current dialogue. Since MEMORY 2 aligns better with the dialogue and accurately references what Classmates B recalls and the current context, it is more helpful.\n\nChoice: 2"
