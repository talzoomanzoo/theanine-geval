    "prediction": "Explanation: The Mentee is currently experiencing feelings of loneliness in a new city after moving due to accepting a job offer. They miss their old friends and are in need of emotional support and reassurance. MEMORY 1 provides relevant information about the Mentor's longstanding support and the Mentee's decision to take the job in the city. However, it includes excessive and unrelated details about the college application process and a past incident of taking shoes, which are not pertinent to the current context. MEMORY 2 includes concise points about the Mentee's job decision and gratitude towards the Mentor, which are relevant to the current circumstance. However, it also includes irrelevant details about the SAT and an unrelated store incident. While neither memory is perfectly aligned with the current context, MEMORY 2 is more organized and directly acknowledges the Mentor's supportive role and the move due to the job offer, which is relevant to addressing the Mentee's feelings of loneliness tied to the move.\n\nChoice: 2"
