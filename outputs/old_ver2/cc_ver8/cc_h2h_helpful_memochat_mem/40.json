    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 emphasizes the supportive nature of the relationship between Classmates A and B, which aligns well with the current context of asking for software recommendations and providing support in learning. Additionally, it highlights Classmates B's emphasis on responsibility, which could be relevant to their willingness to adopt new software recommendations responsibly. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, focuses more broadly on past mistakes, homework help, and friendship experiences, which are less directly related to the current dialogue about computer software and recommendations.\n\nChoice: 1"
