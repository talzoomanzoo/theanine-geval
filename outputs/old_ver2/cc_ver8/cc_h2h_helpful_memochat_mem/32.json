    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 mentions Classmate B's admiration for Classmate A's attitude and resilience, which is helpful given the current dialogue context where Classmate B feels embarrassed and could benefit from Classmate A's positive influence and reassurance. MEMORY 1 provides context on Classmate A's supportive nature and their history of handling tough situations well, which aligns with the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Classmate A is helping Classmate B feel better about the embarrassing situation. MEMORY 2 is less directly related to this emotional context and more focused on shared experiences, which while helpful in reinforcing their camaraderie, does not directly address the help Classmate A is providing in this specific moment. Therefore, MEMORY 1 is more helpful in providing context for the current dialogue.\n\nChoice: 1"
