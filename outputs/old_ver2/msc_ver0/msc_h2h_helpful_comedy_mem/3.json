Any must sees while I am there? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A's cousin recently moved to Sweden, which has sparked Speaker A's interest in visiting the country. This desire to visit Sweden is leading Speaker A to consider saving money by taking on a second part-time job. Additionally, Speaker B, who is from Sweden, suggested checking out the volcanoes in the country for a unique experience.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description: Speaker A is a scientist who is considering taking a second part-time job to save money for a trip to Sweden to visit their cousin. They enjoy decompressing and being active in their free time. \n\nRelationship Description: Speaker A has been talking to their cousin in Sweden and needs to start saving money to visit. Speaker B's parents live in Sweden, and their job at the hospital offers flexible hours. \n\nEvent Description: Speaker A likes to check out local music and coffee shops for conversations.

Speaker A is also interested in jamband music and classic reggae. Speaker B misses Sweden and has many great memories there.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The current dialogue focuses on Speaker A planning a trip to Sweden and seeking recommendations for must-see places from Speaker B. MEMORY 1 provides relevant information that Speaker B, who is from Sweden, recommended checking out the volcanoes there. This directly responds to Speaker A's query for recommendations, making it more relevant and useful for the context. \n\nMEMORY 2, on the other hand, contains a lot of background information about the speakers' interests and past interactions but does not specifically address the request for recommendations in Sweden. Although it provides context on Speaker B's connection to Sweden, it does not offer specific suggestions that would help Speaker B respond to the query about must-see sites.\n\nChoice: 1"
