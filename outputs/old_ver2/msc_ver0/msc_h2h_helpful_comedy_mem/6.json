    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 discusses Speaker B's interest in fishing and willingness to teach Speaker A how to fish and cook, which aligns directly with the ending question in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about fishing. Speaker B's work at a doctor's office and time constraints are mentioned, which fits with not having had time to surf. While MEMORY 2 contains some relevant information, like their shared interests and plans to fish together, it includes more extraneous details that aren't immediately useful for addressing the last question about fishing. Thus, MEMORY 1 provides a more direct and relevant context for Speaker B to respond to Speaker A's query about fishing.\n\nChoice: 1"
