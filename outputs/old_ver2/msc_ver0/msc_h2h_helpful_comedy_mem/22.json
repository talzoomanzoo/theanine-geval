I'll make it as fun as possible.\nSpeaker B: I will someday. just not in the summer when all the bugs are out!

Do you camp most every weekend?\nSpeaker A: A least a couple of times a month. Sometimes, yeah, I go every weekend to relax. Being in nature is so relaxing to me. And nah the bugs aren't too bad in the fall and winter. There's a beautiful river along one trail that I bet you'd love to see. \nSpeaker B: That sounds like it would be relaxing.
