    "prediction": "Explanation: In the dialogue context, Speaker A is asking for game suggestions due to their preference for non-scary games and indecision on what to play next. Therefore, the most helpful memory would be the one that provides insight into what games Speaker B might suggest, or details more about Speaker A's general gaming preferences. Memory 1 mentions that Speaker B plays League of Legends and has tips for playing Resident Evil, which provides context for suggestions. However, more crucially, it details Speaker A's preference for tamer games, hinting that Jurassic Park: World is a game they enjoy, which can help Speaker B suggest games in a similar style. Memory 2 repeats much of this but doesn't emphasize Speaker B's thoughts beyond horror games.\n\nChoice: 1"
