Do you miss it?\nSpeaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \nSpeaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living.\nSpeaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime?\nSpeaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with.\nSpeaker A: Sounds great!

How're you scoring these days? ### Speaker A: Right! It definitely feels like I'm on a hot streak. Hopefully it keeps up through the tournament. One of our other players is injured, though. Did you ever play sports? ### Speaker B: I played intramural soccer in college. Nowadays I mainly just watch it. I like Manchester United, they're my favorite team. Do you like a particular US or FIFA team? ### Speaker A: I love Arsenal, even though they aren't doing so well lately. I can't wait for the season to start up again.
