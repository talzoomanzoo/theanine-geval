Thank you for the recommendation.\nSpeaker B: Of course. I recommend that movie to everyone I meet. I think I've watched it over one hundred times. So what is the next movie on your list to watch soon?\nSpeaker A: Yeah it was great and I will also recommend to people when they ask what movie is good. So next is another one you recommended which is coming to America. What’s the next movie your going to watch? \nSpeaker B: There is a horror genre movie that was released just this week which I'm going to watch tonight. It is called \"Girl Next.\"\nSpeaker A: Oh that sounds interesting, I will look into that and put it on my list. How has your job been going? Is there where you get all these great ideas for what to watch?  \nSpeaker B: My Film Studies professor job has been going absolutely great lately. I love all my students, because they really get into the lectures and ask lots of questions. Yes, my job requires me to watch movies all the time, so that is how I find the best ones. Is your programmer job going all right lately?\nSpeaker A: That sounds amazing. Super lucky to have students that really enjoy what they are learning about and I’m sure that’s down to the way you teach and what you teach them. I’m so glad it is all going well for you. Yeah it is going much better now, I’m really getting in the swing of things thank you for asking. \nSpeaker B: You're welcome. So, returning to the subject of Pulp Fiction, did you think it was funny? Did you think it was too violent for kids to watch? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B, who used to teach Film Studies and carefully chooses what movies to watch, has a sister who shares the same opinion about age as Speaker A. Speaker A is interested in watching movies, mentioned Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman. \nSpeaker B, who has kids and enjoys watching movies with them, enjoys watching suspense films, action, SF, horror, westerns, drama, and occasional good comedy.

Speaker B enjoys watching suspense films, action, SF, horror, westerns, drama, and occasional good comedy.\n6. Speaker B has kids and enjoys watching movies with them.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The MEMORY that will be most helpful should provide relevant information to the current conversation about Pulp Fiction, Speaker A's interest in films, and Speaker B's background and preferences that relate to the discussion. The MEMORY should also include information relevant to the age appropriateness of movies since Speaker B asked if Speaker A thought Pulp Fiction was too violent for kids.\n\nChoice: 1\n\nWhile both MEMORIES highlight Speaker B's background and movie preferences, MEMORY 1 includes a reference to how Speaker B's sister shares the same opinion about age as Speaker A and that Speaker B has kids, which is relevant to the question about whether Pulp Fiction is too violent for kids. These details about opinions on age and having kids are crucial for providing context for the violence question Speaker B asked in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making MEMORY 1 more helpful."
