    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant about the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, enabling the Co-workers A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I just gave my boss the written report. I hope she finds it helpful.\nCo-workers B: Did you make sure to include all the necessary details?\nCo-workers A: Yes, I made sure to cover everything we talked about in the meeting. I even added some extra information that I thought could be useful.\nCo-workers B: That's smart thinking. It shows that you're invested in the company and want to make sure things run smoothly.\nCo-workers A: Thanks. I learned a lot from taking over the family business. It taught me the importance of being efficient and proactive.\nCo-workers B: I remember you telling me about that. It's amazing how much you've accomplished since then. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nCo-worker A's father was hesitant to hand over the business but now trusts Co-worker A. This experience taught Co-worker A the importance of being efficient and proactive.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker A took over their family's business a few years ago and it has improved since then.\n2. Co-worker A has a family business that has been doing well recently.\n3. Co-worker A took over the family business and made changes to adapt to modern times.\n4. Co-worker B appreciates the pen and thanks Co-worker A for the gesture.\n5. Co-worker A made changes to modernize processes and invest in new technology for the business.\n6. Co-worker A's father was hesitant to hand over the business but now trusts Co-worker A.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 clearly outlines the specific information that Co-worker A had previously discussed about taking over the family business, including the initial hesitation from their father and the importance of being efficient and proactive. This directly connects to the last part of the dialogue and provides a focused and relevant context for Co-worker A's learning experience. \n\nMEMORY 2, while it contains relevant information, includes extraneous details (e.g., appreciation for a pen) that do not pertain directly to the dialogue context and make it less coherent and focused. \n\nChoice: 1"
