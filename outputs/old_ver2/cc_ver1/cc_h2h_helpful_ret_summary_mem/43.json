Do you want to talk about how you're feeling or do something to take your mind off of things?\nNeighbors A: Maybe both?

    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT shows Neighbor A feeling lost and overwhelmed after a breakup, looking for support and a way to cope. Both MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 emphasize Neighbor B's support and how they enjoy going for walks together, which is relevant to Neighbor B's suggestion to go for a walk. However, MEMORY 2 provides an additional piece of relevant information about Neighbor A finding solace in nature, directly supporting Neighbor B's suggestion, and clarifies that Neighbor A is grieving the loss of their grandmother, providing deeper context to Neighbor A's emotional state. This makes MEMORY 2 slightly more relevant and helpful.\n\nChoice: 2"
