That was such a disaster.\nCo-workers B: It was definitely not one of your finest moments. But it's good to see that you're being responsible now and taking care of things like sending packages.\nCo-workers A: Thanks. I'm trying to be more responsible and reliable these days.\nCo-workers B: That's great to hear. It reminds me of the time when you were a great leader in your country. You were strong, determined, and made a positive impact. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nCo-worker B advises Co-worker A to be more disciplined and plan ahead for their actions.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 directly relates to Co-workers B advising Co-workers A to be more disciplined in the context of the story about past leadership. This memory directly reflects the conversation's line where Co-workers B mentioned Co-workers A being a leader and responsible, which makes sense in the conversation's context. Meanwhile, MEMORY 2 contains additional information about their relationship and past advice, but it doesn't connect as closely with the current dialogue's mention of being responsible and leadership.\n\nChoice: 1"
