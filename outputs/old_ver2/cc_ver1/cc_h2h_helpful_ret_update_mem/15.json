It's all about promoting under-the-radar artists.\nClassmates B: I haven't had a chance to yet, but that sounds really cool! What inspired you to start it?\nClassmates A: Well, I've always had a passion for the arts, but I was too afraid to pursue it. I finally realized that it's what I really love, and I wanted to share that love with others.\nClassmates B: That's amazing. It takes a lot of courage to pursue your passions like that.\nClassmates A: Yeah, it was scary at first, but the response has been really positive. I'm so glad I finally decided to take the leap.\nClassmates B: I'm proud of you. It's always great to see someone following their dreams.\nClassmates A: Thanks, it's been a journey, but I'm really happy with where I am now. It's crazy to think that years ago, I was so hesitant to even share this part of myself.\nClassmates B: It just goes to show that it's never too late to start pursuing what you love. Remember when we talked about you living your life on your own terms? You're doing just that. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nClassmates B encouraged Classmates A to step out of their comfort zone and try new things for personal growth. This aligns with their shared value of trying new things and taking risks for personal development. As a result, Classmates A values living life on their own terms and being content with their choices. This attitude towards independence and happiness has led Classmates A to pursue their passions and find joy in life.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Classmates A ended up taking Classmates B's advice and found success with it.\n2. Both Classmates A and B value the importance of trying new things and taking risks for personal development.\n3. Classmates B expresses a desire to see Classmates A happy and successful in life.\n4. Classmate B emphasizes the importance of positively impacting others while living a fulfilling life.\n5. Classmates B gave advice to Classmates A in the past that paid off.\n6. Classmates A was initially hesitant about following Classmates B's advice.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides details that directly address Classmates B's comments and affirmations towards Classmates A's journey and success. It mentions the importance of trying new things, taking risks, and how Classmates A initially hesitated but eventually valued B's advice, leading to success. These points align well with Classmates B's supportive role in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. MEMORY 1, while touching on independence and happiness, lacks the specific correlation of B's advice to A's success, which is emphasized in the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 2"
