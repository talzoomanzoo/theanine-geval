    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant about the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, enabling the Neighbors A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, have you noticed how strong I've become?\nNeighbors B: Wow, you do look very strong! Have you been working out?\nNeighbors A: Yes, I go to the gym every day and lift weights. It's been really helping me build muscle.\nNeighbors B: That's great to hear! It reminds me of the time when you apologized to me for the way you treated me.\nNeighbors A: Yes, I realized that I needed to take responsibility for my actions and I didn't want to make the same mistake again.\nNeighbors B: It's always important to own up to our mistakes. It's like when you forgot your backpack in high school and had to deal with the consequences. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Neighbors A and B discussed the importance of caring for trees and the environment for future generations, which led to Neighbor B accepting Neighbor A's apology and expressing how hurtful the previous treatment was. This prompted Neighbor A to apologize and acknowledge their wrongdoing.\n   \n2. Neighbors A and B talked about the significance of preserving trees and the environment for the future, prompting Neighbor A to apologize to Neighbor B and show willingness to make things right. In response, Neighbor B reminded Neighbor A about the importance of taking responsibility for past mistakes and learning from them, which led to Neighbor A apologizing and admitting fault.\n\n3. Neighbors A and B recognized the value of using fallen trees for firewood or other purposes, which led to Neighbor A apologizing to Neighbor B and expressing a desire to mend their relationship. This apology caused Neighbors A and B to address their issues and maintain a friendly bond.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbors A apologized to Neighbors B for their behavior and admitted to being wrong.\n2. Neighbors B appreciates Neighbors A's handy skills.\n3. Neighbor A noticed some wood near their backyard and asked Neighbor B if they had seen it too.\n4. Neighbors A and B emphasize the importance of taking care of trees and the environment for future generations.\n5. Neighbors A values double-checking before leaving the house.\n6. Neighbors A is good at fixing things, particularly electronics.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more helpful because it directly relates to the apology referenced in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and provides additional context that Neighbor A has owned up to their mistakes in the past. It aligns with the part of the conversation where Neighbor A takes responsibility for their actions, which is reflected in Neighbors B's memory of the apology. MEMORY 1 contains too much irrelevant information about discussions on trees and firewood that do not directly connect to the apology mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\nChoice: 2"
