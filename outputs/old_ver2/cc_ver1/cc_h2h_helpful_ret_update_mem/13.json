    "prediction": "Explanation: Both MEMORIES provide information about the Mentee's journey to sobriety, their appreciation for the Mentor's support, and the Mentee's recent focus on living in the moment. However, MEMORY 1 provides a more narrative context, focusing on the emotional aspects of the Mentee's gratitude and how the Mentor's support has been specifically invaluable in their journey. This aligns closely with the Mentee's last statement about living in the moment, suggesting a more personal connection and emotional depth in their journey that the Mentor can respond to. MEMORY 2 provides factual points but lacks the depth that may guide the Mentor into a more supportive and uplifting response about the Mentee's progress and realizations.\n\nChoice: 1"
