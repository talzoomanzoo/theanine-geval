    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant about the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, enabling the Neighbors A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just got back from my trip to South America. It was amazing!\nNeighbors B: Oh really? Where did you go?\nNeighbors A: I visited Brazil and Peru. The culture and food were incredible.\nNeighbors B: That sounds awesome. I've always wanted to go to Peru to see Machu Picchu.\nNeighbors A: Yes, Machu Picchu is amazing. The view from the top is breathtaking.\nNeighbors B: Have you thought about where you want to go next? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbors A taught the kid the special move to help them feel better, and Neighbors B agreed to buy candy for the neighborhood kids to spread happiness. Neighbors B then admired Neighbors A's organization skills and expressed a desire to enhance their own organization. In response, Neighbor A showed willingness to take precautions and make smart decisions. \n\nNeighbors A won against a kid in chess by using a special move, which led both Neighbors A and B to believe in the value of doing good deeds to strengthen the community. Neighbor B, concerned about safety, cautioned against connecting with strangers. \n\nBoth Neighbors A and B share a belief in the significance of learning and self-improvement, as well as the importance of performing acts of kindness to foster unity. Neighbor B recommended alternative ways to manage stress and emphasized the importance of Neighbor A's well-being.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbors A and B believe in doing nice things for others to bring the community together.\n2. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's organization skills and wishes to improve their own organization.\n3. Neighbors A and B both took a cooking class together last year.\n4. Both Neighbors A and B believe in the importance of learning and self-improvement.\n5. Neighbor A is feeling frustrated and is considering going to a bar to find someone for a casual encounter.\n6. Neighbor B suggests finding other ways to relieve frustration and looking out for Neighbor A's well-being.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is centered on Neighbors A's travel experiences and future travel plans. The last utterance by Neighbor B asks Neighbors A about their next travel destination. MEMORY 1 mainly focuses on the themes of community actions, safety concerns, and promoting well-being, which are not relevant to the context of discussing travel or future plans. MEMORY 2, while sharing some thematic overlap with MEMORY 1, includes specific details about past shared activities (cooking class), which could offer Neighbors A a basis to discuss or plan a future trip that includes learning or self-improvement activities like a further cooking class. However, most of MEMORY 2 also falls outside the travel discussion context.\n\nUltimately, neither MEMORY directly supports an answer to the question about future travel plans. However, MEMORY 2 contains slightly more personal information that hints at activities that involve learning and collaboration, which can be tied into planning future experiences.\n\nChoice: 2"
