    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant about the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, enabling the Co-workers B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hi there, I was wondering if you'd like to join me for lunch on Tuesday at the school cafeteria.\nCo-workers B: Oh, sure. Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking?\nCo-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for asking me to join you.\nCo-workers A: No problem, it'll be great to catch up. Hey, do you remember when we talked about me being irresponsible a few years ago?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, I remember that conversation. What about it?\nCo-workers A: Well, I wanted to share some good news with you. I've been recently promoted to the night shift and have been doing a great job. I think I've come a long way since those days. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nCo-worker A has made mistakes in the past but is trying to be more aware of their actions, which leads to Co-worker B moving on from their arrest and appreciating Co-worker A's concern and change in behavior. This reminds Co-worker B of Co-worker A's progress and potential for success. Co-worker A is adjusting to the night shift schedule and excited for a promotion.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker B reassures Co-worker A and encourages them to have more confidence.\n2. Co-workers A and B have worked together on a big story in the past.\n3. Co-worker B is supportive and encouraging towards Co-worker A.\n4. Co-worker A is managing the night shift by getting enough rest during the day and staying focused.\n5. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B acknowledge the importance of taking responsibility for their actions and learning from mistakes.\n6. Co-worker A is trying to be more conscious of how their actions impact others and avoid causing problems for anyone else.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides a direct reference to Co-worker A's past irresponsibility and their current progress, which relates specifically to Co-worker A's promotion and improved performance on the night shift. This is relevant to the dialogue, where Co-worker A mentions these exact topics. MEMORY 2, while containing some supportive elements and information about the night shift, is more generalized and doesn't as effectively tie back to the specific conversation about past irresponsibility and the recent promotion.\n\nChoice: 1"
