    "prediction": "Explanation: The current dialogue context involves a conversation between Speaker A and Speaker B about family traditions, particularly jello recipes, learning to bake, and water skiing. Both MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 contain relevant information about jello recipes and family traditions. However, MEMORY 2 additionally includes Speaker B's interest in learning to bake, which directly ties into the current discussion about learning to bake, and their excitement about joining Speaker A's family for a water skiing trip, which connects to the question about skiing. This makes MEMORY 2 more comprehensive and relevant for responding to the current dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 2"
