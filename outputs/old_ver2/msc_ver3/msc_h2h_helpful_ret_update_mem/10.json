    "prediction": "Explanation: The CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses on a new dish added to the menu at Speaker A's workplace and whether Speaker A will also get a free dessert. MEMORY 1 is more helpful because it provides relevant information about Speaker A's entitlement to free meals (including potential desserts), their experience with a fire incident at work, and their positive attitude towards interactions and work experiences. These align with the context where Speaker A expresses excitement about trying the new dish and answering about dessert, as their experience at the restaurant is highlighted. \n\nMEMORY 2 contains similar information but lacks specifics about the free meals and the positive mention of interaction experiences with customers at the restaurant, which could influence whether or not they'll also take home free dessert goodies, as mentioned in the context.\n\nChoice: 1"
