    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 both give information about Speaker B's involvement in Boy Scouts and their busy schedule, which ties well into the context of the discussion about camping and survival skills. However, MEMORY 2 provides additional context about Speaker B's goal of earning the Eagle Scout badge and their work at a fast food place, which is relevant to Speaker B's time management and commitment to different activities. Given that the topic leans heavily on the mutual appreciation of skills learned through scouting and the context of the larger conversation involving school planning, the additional details in MEMORY 2 add potentially useful depth for Speaker B to respond or align with his scouting journey and future aspirations.\n\nChoice: 2"
