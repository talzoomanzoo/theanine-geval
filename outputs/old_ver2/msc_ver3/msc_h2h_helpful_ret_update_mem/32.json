    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories provide relevant background information about Speaker A's connection to jello and their grandmother's influence on learning recipes, which can offer context to their conversation on desserts and family traditions.

Thus, MEMORY 2 provides more specific context for the skiing and jello-related parts of the conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
