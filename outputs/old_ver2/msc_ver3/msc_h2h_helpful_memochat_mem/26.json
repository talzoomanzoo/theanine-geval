It is made from clay. ### Speaker B: Oh I see! I've never used a pressure cooker before. Does it cook other things other than lentils? I hear it makes the cooking go much faster. ### Speaker A: Yes, you can do lots of things in pressure cookers like stews and soups. Most of the time, I use it to soften meat. I love putting my lamb shanks in there. It makes the meat fall right off the bone. Do you have a pressure cooker? ### Speaker B: I don't, but hearing what you're saying makes me want to purchase one for my husband. He's an avid cook but sometimes that makes the cooking process a lot longer than I want! ### Speaker A: I would recommend a pressure cooker. It is a great item for beginner cooks.

It also highlights Speaker B's interest in learning to cook with a pressure cooker, tying neatly to the conversation about pressure cooker recipes.
