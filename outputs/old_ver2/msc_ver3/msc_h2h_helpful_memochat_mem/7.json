Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip?  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A is a librarian and loves kids, mentioning having 3 children. This makes Speaker A busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. Consequently, Speaker B, who has a lot of kids all grown up with kids of their own, enjoys spending time with their grandkids at the park. This led Speaker B to take their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Hobbies and Bonding', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B talk about their hobbies and bonding activities with family members.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: :), so how was the trip to the park with your grandkids? ### Speaker B: It was great the weather was really nice and I really enjoyed getting outside and getting some fresh air ### Speaker A: My youngest child just asked me if I could teach them how to play the flute! ### Speaker B: Oh really? So they want to play the flute like you. That's wonderful to hear. Are you planning to teach them yourself or hire a teacher? ### Speaker A: I am going to teach them myself. I am just so proud that they came to me and asked for my help. It was nice to feel wanted by my kids.  ### Speaker B: I bet is a wonderful feeling. I took my grandkids fishing once because they asked me to. It's a great way to bond with them. Now you and your youngest can bond through music. I think that's wonderful. ### Speaker A: Yes, I am so glad we can spend some time together and bond over flutes. She wants to learn because of the singer Lizzo. She can play the flute so well that it inspired her.

Me too. I am a bit out of touch too with the latest music. My daughter played the video of her playing the flute and singing. It was incredible. I am glad she found a motivation though. Can any of your kids play an instrument? ### Speaker B: No not my kids or grandkids. They spend so much time on their phones and tablets that they rarely take interest in such things. It would be wonderful if one of them did take an interest in music. Is your youngest the only one interested in musical intrustments right now? ### Speaker A: Yes at the moment. My other two are just like yours - addicted to tablets and phones. I hoping that when I start teaching my youngest the flute the others would want to join in. I will grab a few spare just in case. Did you ever take your kids fishing? Did they like it? ### Speaker B: They sure did. Even though the oldest girl was so busy with her texting and what not. The other grandkids loved it and even caught a good sized fish! I really hope they'll let me take them again one day. ### Speaker A: That is amazing! You should try and put a date in the calendar and make it an annual thing. So that way they all know. It might help.  ### Speaker B: That's a great idea actually! It can be an annual fishing trip. Phones and technology is nice but getting in touch with nature is unlike anything else. I appreciate your suggestion.
