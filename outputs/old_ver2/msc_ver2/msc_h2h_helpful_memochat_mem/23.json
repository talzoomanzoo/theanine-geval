Shows and movies are my favorite past time.  I love horror movies.  I think it's so cool you make horror movies with your dad.  How do you come up with the plot to your movies? ### Speaker B: We have a lot of weird, creative conversations. We always have in my family. We used to write parts of stories and then swap them half-way through so that the other person could take over the story and add different creative elements to it. That's honestly how we still come up with some of our ideas. ### Speaker A: That's terrific!  Have you seen any good horror movies recently?  Personally, I prefer the classics like Halloween or Friday the 13th. ### Speaker B: Yes, we watch a lot of horror movies in our family. Our favorite right now is the Conjuring series of films and their spin-offs. The newest one just came out and it was ok. Have you seen any horror movies lately? ### Speaker A: Yes, but just the classics like I mentioned.  I'm not too keen on the modern ones, they just don't make them like they used to.  Who knows, maybe one day I'll be watching your creation in the theatres.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time?
