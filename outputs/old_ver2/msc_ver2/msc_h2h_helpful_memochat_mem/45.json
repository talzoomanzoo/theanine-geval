PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is not helpful in that context.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\nSpeaker B enjoys camping, hiking, and is kind, caring, and hopeful for group equality.\nSpeaker A does not care about voting and plans to send their parents a postcard.\nSpeaker B does not vote and wants their neighbor John to know about their stance on group equality.\nSpeaker A enjoys camping and hiking, mentioning setting up a hammock at their campsite.\nSpeaker B has a hammock in their backyard but their dog frequently uses it.\nSpeaker B has children, a dog, and enjoys hiking, mentioning the Columbia Trail and Ken Lockwood Gorge near High Bridge.\nSpeaker B's neighbor, John, is getting divorced and selling top-of-the-line camping gear.\nSpeaker A is looking for a job and new camping gear, specifically a hammock.\nSpeaker A plans to potentially visit the Columbia Trail and Ken Lockwood Gorge for a camping and hiking trip.\nSpeaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\nSpeaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\nSpeaker A plans to leave a hammock by the river for anyone to use at a hidden spot off the main hiking trail.\nSpeaker A will use the money earned from the store to buy the hammock online.\nSpeaker A and Speaker B have gone hiking together before and plan to meet up for another hike.\nSpeaker A and Speaker B are planning to go hiking together this weekend.\nSpeaker A suggests bringing water for the hike and mentions having a picnic at the top of the mountain.\nSpeaker B is not in the best hiking shape and jokes about needing to recharge their energy.\nSpeaker A plans to bring sandwiches and fruit for the hike, specifically asking about veggie sandwiches for Speaker B.\nSpeaker A has a portable hammock for the hike and asks if Speaker B will bring theirs.\nSpeaker A decides not to bring the hammock due to extra weight in their bag.\nThere is a lake at the hiking trail, and Speaker A suggests swimming in it, warning that the water may be cold.\nSpeaker B is excited about the idea of swimming in the lake, mentioning they have swum in cold water before.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for.\nSpeaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for?\nSpeaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\nSpeaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise? \nSpeaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows.\nSpeaker A: That sounds wonderful! You'd get to just be out in nature all day. Sounds like a great job, especially if you're a bit introverted like me. That's why hiking is my favorite -- a good solitary activity. \nSpeaker B: Yes, I agree. What kind of hours would this new job have?\nSpeaker A: It's third shift, which isn't the greatest, but it pays a bit more than the other shifts, and I think I'll like getting off early in the morning. Then I can just go down and get in my hammock and have a nice relaxing moment after work. \nSpeaker B: Would you feel safe being out there all alone, possibly falling asleep? That just sounds a bit risky. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B enjoys camping, hiking, and is kind, caring, and hopeful for group equality.

The memory reinforces Speaker A's excitement about the location and potential for hikes after work, which aligns with Speaker A's expressed interests.
