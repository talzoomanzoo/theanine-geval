PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is not helpful in that context.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker A's mother is a pediatrician.\nSpeaker A has a dog named Wylie.\nSpeaker A's father is a fireman.\nSpeaker B has three kids.\nSpeaker B commutes to work by boat because they live in Amsterdam with many canals.\nSpeaker B enjoys being outside and reading Star Wars novels.\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both enjoy reading and are librarians.\nSpeaker A has kids and is familiar with Greek mythology.\nSpeaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian.\nSpeaker B's lucky number is three, which coincides with the number of kids they have, being the third born in their family, and the uniform number when they played handball.\nSpeaker A believes the world needs more strong women and agrees with the importance of the present time for them to rise.\nSpeaker A's lucky number is 7.\nSpeaker B appreciates the significance of the number 12, relating it to the 12 goddesses in mythology.\nSpeaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five.\nSpeaker A has traveled around Europe before, visiting capital cities of each country.\nSpeaker A's favorite cities from the trip were Rome, Berlin, Madrid, and Helsinki.\nSpeaker A took someone named Wylie with them on the trip.\nSpeaker B is interested in going to Finland but has not been able to visit yet.\nSpeaker B goes on a summer holiday every year with their family of five.\nSpeaker A enjoys traveling but prefers not to do it alone.\nSpeaker A booked a plane ticket to Rome on a whim and is leaving in two weeks.\nSpeaker B is planning to leave for a trip later in the summer, likely a month before school starts.\nSpeaker B and their kids are excited about their upcoming trip to Greece.\nSpeaker A hasn't planned their trip out yet but is open to suggestions.\nSpeaker B recommends visiting the Parthenon, Acropolis of Athens, and the beach on Corfu Island in Greece.\nSpeaker B's favorite Greek god/goddess is Athena.\nSpeaker B asks Speaker A if their trip is more for relaxation or sightseeing.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it?\nSpeaker B: Yes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see. \nSpeaker A: I definitely will, this sounds like such an amazing trip. How long has it been since you've been there yourself?\nSpeaker B: I was in Greece last two years ago.   I am excited to go again soon!    At somepoint I would like to take a cruise around the islands there.  It seems like a neat way to see all the Islands in an easy way.   Have you ever taken a cruise?\nSpeaker A: Only once before when I was very young, so I don't remember much. It sounds like such a relaxing way to enjoy the day, though. Maybe we can plan a cruise together sometime.\nSpeaker B: That would be fun!  I go to Europe a lot so maybe a cruise in the Caribbean would be nice.  I would like to see Saint Lucia and Saint Thomas. \nSpeaker A: Oh, Europe? I'm already sold on the idea, sounds like a blast! I've never had a negative experience in Europe. Should we visit some of the capital cities?\nSpeaker B: I would like to go to Paris.  Since I live in Amsterdam I could take the train down.  I have seen much and Italy and Greece but would love to go to Paris.  Have you been there before? \nSpeaker A: Only once, and I had a really great time there. The buildings were so beautiful and the food was delicious. Do you like French food?\nSpeaker B: I do like French food- but it is very rich.  I especially love French desserts like macarons.   I would like to see the museums in Paris. \nSpeaker A: That's a good idea! I definitely haven't seen enough of them. Should we bring anyone else along on our trip? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A's mother being a pediatrician causes Speaker A to have kids and be familiar with Greek mythology. This leads to Speaker B and their kids being excited about their upcoming trip to Greece. \nSpeaker B enjoying being outside and reading Star Wars novels is the same topic as Speaker B being excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loving Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian. This leads to Speaker B planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five, recommending visiting the Parthenon, Acropolis of Athens, and the beach on Corfu Island in Greece. \nSpeaker B wanting to bring three kids causes Speaker A to have kids and be familiar with Greek mythology. This makes Speaker A want to travel around Europe, visiting capital cities of each country, and react by booking a plane ticket to Rome on a whim, leaving in two weeks.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Sightseeing Plans', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B discuss sightseeing priorities in Rome and Greece.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: I haven't really planned the trip out as it's so last minute!

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 combines various unrelated details from the dialogue and introduces strange causality that doesn't provide helpful context for responding to the ongoing conversation about travel and sightseeing. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 focuses on relevant sightseeing plans in Greece and Rome and refers directly to a discussion about visiting the Acropolis, which aligns well with the current dialogue context and could guide a natural continuation of the discussion about travel plans and sightseeing.\n\nChoice: 2"
