    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 presents relevant information about Speaker A's sons, specifically mentioning relationships and the anticipation of meeting his son's Spanish girlfriend, which directly correlates with the current dialogue context about meeting the girlfriend in Spain. MEMORY 2, while also discussing relationships, provides a broader context of past discussions and summarizations not directly related to the specific detail of meeting the girlfriend. Thus, MEMORY 1 is more immediately tied to the ongoing conversation about relationships and travel.\n\nChoice: 1"
