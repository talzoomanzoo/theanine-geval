Did you snag a buck? ### Speaker A: Not this time.  It still went good though.  I checked out the conditions for some of the animals living in the area.  What have you been up to? ### Speaker B: I spent all night playing League of Legends.  But after that I bought Resident Evil VIII.  I haven't turned it on yet but I'm looking forward to it.  Usually I wait for a sale but I couldn't resist. ### Speaker A: That's cool.  What is Resident Evil VIII about?   ### Speaker B: It's a horror game.  You're a guy looking for his kidnapped daughter and you have to explore a bunch of eerie locations full of monsters.

Sometimes I hunt on mine or my family's places and sometimes I go to state hunting sites.  You should go next time I go! ### Speaker B: That would be fun!  I've never shot a real gun before though.
