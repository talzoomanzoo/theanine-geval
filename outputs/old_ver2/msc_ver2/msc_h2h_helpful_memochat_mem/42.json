I am not an interior decorator though am I. Maybe I am actually clueless lol. ### Speaker B: Yeah, its not a dark green. More of a pastel. It sounds like we are both clueless. I might just leave it and claim I am colour blind.  ### Speaker A: Or you could add a few random splashes of like neon pink and lavender to the wall. Get some outlandish curtains and hang up a bead door to the room and call it the chill room where colors mesh and collide to make an inspiring hippy feel. Idk ### Speaker B: I like the way you are thinking. Want to come over and splash some colour all over the place? ### Speaker A: Ohhh yes! I would love to do that. Maybe you could even get some on the couches or on the wood furniture just for fun.
