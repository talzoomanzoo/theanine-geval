PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is not helpful in that context.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker A is older and has eight grandchildren.\nSpeaker B is 28 years old, turning 29 next week.\nSpeaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\nSpeaker B recently got a new blue hair color and a new Easter dress.\nSpeaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\nSpeaker B received a new car from their mom and plans to drive during spring break.\nBoth Speaker A's mother and Speaker A were librarians, but Speaker A is retired.\nSpeaker A is older and mentions having blue hair already.\nSpeaker B dyed their hair with henna and enjoys experimenting with different hair colors.\nSpeaker A is considering dying their hair red and then purple for fun with their grandkids.\nSpeaker A finds getting old no fun and jokes about the inevitability of grey hair.\nSpeaker B loves grey hair and plans to dye their hair a cool shade of grey.\nSpeaker B's new dress is blue, but more of a turquoise shade.\nSpeaker B's new car is black, and it is their first new car after driving pre-owned cars before.\nSpeaker A is getting their hair dyed turquoise by their youngest grandchild, who wants to pursue hairdressing as a profession.\nSpeaker B bought a red VW Tiguan due to a good deal and concerns about rising car prices.\nSpeaker A is worried about gas mileage and asks about the fuel efficiency of Speaker B's car.\nSpeaker B plans to touch up their hair for the summer due to sun and pool damage.\nSpeaker A, a retired librarian, recommends the book \"Beautiful Ruins\" by Jess Walter for a beach visit.\nSpeaker B asks if the recommended book is fiction or nonfiction.\nSpeaker A has a granddaughter who is a cosmetologist and helped dye their hair in streaks.\nSpeaker A's granddaughter is 14 years old and has dreams of starting her own salon or working at a high-end salon in a big city.\nSpeaker B has an oldest nephew who is about to turn 14.\nSpeaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\nSpeaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing?  \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker A mentions having eight grandchildren and already having blue hair. Speaker B has an oldest nephew who is about to turn 14.\n2. Both Speaker A's mother and Speaker A were librarians, but Speaker A is retired. Speaker B asks if the recommended book is fiction or nonfiction.\n3. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one. Speaker A, a retired librarian, recommends the book \"Beautiful Ruins\" by Jess Walter for a beach visit.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n2. Speaker B has an oldest nephew who is about to turn 14.\n3. Speaker B asks if the recommended book is fiction or nonfiction.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation.\n5. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n6. Both Speaker A's mother and Speaker A were librarians, but Speaker A is retired.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: In the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, Speaker A inquires about Speaker B's nephew, which directly relates to MEMORY 1 entry 1 and MEMORY 2 entry 2, which mention Speaker B's oldest nephew who is about to turn 14. Since both memories provide the same information about the nephew, the choice will depend on additional relevancy.\n\nMEMORY 1 mentions Speaker A's preference for historical fiction and the book \"Beautiful Ruins,\" but the specific connection to the nephew is only in entry 1.\n\nMEMORY 2 offers a broader range of context about Speaker B's trip, which is relevant since it connects to Speaker B's mention of their Costa Rica trip in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, and other aspects such as both having a sense of humor. This contextual fabric, albeit tangential, provides more depth to the conversation. It gives Speaker A additional insights beyond the immediate question about the nephew.\n\nThus, MEMORY 2 is more helpful as it contains useful context associated with the trip that Speaker B is discussing and provides more narrative for Speaker B's current circumstances.\n\nChoice: 2"
