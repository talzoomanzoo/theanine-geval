It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 contains more specific and relevant information about both Speaker A and B's academic struggles and aspirations, such as Speaker A's hope for a soccer scholarship and Speaker B's pressure to maintain A's in sports medicine. These details align with the dialogue context and can help Speaker B respond more empathetically to Speaker A's request for help with the English exam. MEMORY 1 lacks some specific details about their aspirations and pressures, making MEMORY 2 more helpful in understanding the background of both speakers.\n\nChoice: 2"
