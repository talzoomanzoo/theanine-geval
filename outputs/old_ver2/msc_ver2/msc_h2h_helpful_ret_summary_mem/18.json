Do you miss it?\nSpeaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \nSpeaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living.\nSpeaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime?\nSpeaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with.\nSpeaker A: Sounds great!

    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories contain information about Speaker A's involvement in soccer and their performance, which is relevant given the recent talk about soccer and potentially playing together. However, MEMORY 2 offers additional insight about Speaker B being a fan of Manchester United, which could be helpful in the ongoing discussion related to soccer. This could enable Speaker B to connect over their mutual interest in soccer teams or discuss more about soccer.\n\nChoice: 2"
