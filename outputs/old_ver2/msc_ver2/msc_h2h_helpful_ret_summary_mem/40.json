    "prediction": "Explanation: The relevant conversation is about camping and the Boy Scouts, specifically regarding the latest location Speaker B went camping. MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 both mention Speaker B's involvement in the Boy Scouts and their rank, which is relevant to the conversation. However, MEMORY 1 also provides additional context on future plans for college, which can potentially lead to a broader conversation or understanding, but not as useful in this specific dialogue. MEMORY 2 reaffirms Speaker B's involvement in scouts, which is more relevant to the current conversation thread where Speaker A asked about Speaker B's last camping location. \n\nChoice: tie"
