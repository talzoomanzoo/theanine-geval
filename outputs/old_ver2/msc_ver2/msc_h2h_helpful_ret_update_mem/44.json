    "prediction": "Explanation: The helpfulness criterion requires MEMORY to be relevant and useful to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. MEMORY 1 contains detailed information that directly aligns with the conversation about Speaker A training for the marathon and the motivational context. It mentions Speaker B's experience with marathons and motivational speaking, which aligns with their role in motivating Speaker A. Additionally, MEMORY 1 provides more depth into Speaker B's personal experiences, such as battling depression and taking solace in outdoor activities, which might relate to their motivation techniques. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 provides a broader, less detailed overview and is somewhat repetitive. \n\nChoice: 1"
