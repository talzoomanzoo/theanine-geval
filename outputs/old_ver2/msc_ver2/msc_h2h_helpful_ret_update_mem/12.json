PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is not helpful in that context.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\nSpeaker B plays soccer and volunteers at their mom's school in the after-school program.\nSpeaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\nSpeaker B lives with their mom and is currently in college.\nSpeaker A is living with their grandparents and helps them out.\nSpeaker A used to play football a lot but now enjoys hanging out with friends and playing video games.\nSpeaker A likes playing games from the Elder Scrolls Series, Witcher, Legend of Zelda, and Super Mario Bros.\nSpeaker A does not usually play 1st person shooters unless they have more to offer.\nSpeaker B is part of a local amateur soccer team and used to play World of Warcraft a lot in high school and college.\nSpeaker B now casually plays Overwatch and enjoys 1st person shooter games for their quick pick-up-and-play nature.\nSpeaker B has tried playing soccer with the kids in their mom's after school program but they weren't very interested.\nSpeaker A is studying computer science and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth.\nSpeaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\nSpeaker A believes in the importance of giving back and helping youth access resources.\nSpeaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\nSpeaker A is involved with a football league and is looking forward to playing games.\nSpeaker B plays on a soccer team and has a match coming up.\nSpeaker A mentions being out of practice with exercise but is looking to get back into it.\nSpeaker B suggests trying the game Elder Scrolls, knowing Speaker A plays World of Warcraft.\nSpeaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\nSpeaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\nSpeaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science, and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics. \nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities. \nSpeaker B majoring in linguistics causes Speaker A to be interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n3. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n4. Speaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\n5. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n6.

    "prediction": "Explanation: \nThe dialogue context shows a conversation about career options and teaching plans, with Speaker A expressing an interest in teaching robotics and Speaker B considering a stable career in teaching linguistics. To provide a relevant response, the memory should reinforce details related to their aspirations and how they value education. \n\nMEMORY 1 emphasizes Speaker A's interest in teaching and developing apps, along with Speaker B's challenges in linguistics. However, it incorrectly suggests Speaker A's interest in robotics is sparked by Speaker B majoring in linguistics, which doesn't align with the dialogue context.\n\nMEMORY 2 concisely outlines Speaker A's and Speaker B's aspirations, their shared education values, and their extracurricular involvements, making it more relevant to the conversation on career and teaching.\n\nChoice: 2"
