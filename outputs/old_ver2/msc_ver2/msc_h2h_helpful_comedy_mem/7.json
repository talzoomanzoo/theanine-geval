It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip?  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A is a librarian and loves kids, mentioning having 3 children. This makes Speaker A busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. Consequently, Speaker B, who has a lot of kids all grown up with kids of their own, enjoys spending time with their grandkids at the park. This led Speaker B to take their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description: Speaker B is a librarian who had a good day playing with his son's kids.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 is more closely aligned with the current topic of discussion, as it reflects on the shared idea of making a fishing trip an annual tradition. This is directly related to Speaker B's question about the annual fishing trip, making it more helpful and relevant to the dialogue context. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, doesn't directly relate to the current conversation about the fishing trip and instead provides broader context about Speaker B's relationship with their grandkids and libraries.\n\nChoice: 1"
