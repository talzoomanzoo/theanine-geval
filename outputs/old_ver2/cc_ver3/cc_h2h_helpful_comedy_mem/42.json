    "prediction": "Explanation: The CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around Classmates A asking Classmates B how they found out about something from Classmates A's past, implying a deeper interest in Classmates A's history and personal circumstances. MEMORY 1 includes details on how Classmates A and B became friends, Classmates A's curiosity, and their openness to new experiences and taking risks. These aspects can potentially relate to what Classmates A is curious about. However, MEMORY 2 provides a clearer depiction of Classmates A's beliefs and circumstances, including their belief in positivity and the relationship dynamics with Classmates B. The mention of how Classmates A was nervous about fitting in and finding new solutions could hint at relevant past experiences. Additionally, MEMORY 2 provides a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship dynamics, which is crucial for Classmates B's response about respecting Classmates A's privacy. MEMORY 2 is helpful because it informs why Classmates B might not want to share past details, reinforcing the context of advice and encouragement, which might involve respecting boundaries.\n\nChoice: 2"
