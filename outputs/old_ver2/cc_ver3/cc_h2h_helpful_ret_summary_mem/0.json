    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 provides more context about the Parent's experiences and the future plans regarding watching the sunrise together. This is relevant to the current dialogue about feeling heard during tough times, as it highlights the Parent's reflections on their past mistakes and turning their life around. This connects to the Child's query about whether the Parent felt unheard in detention. Memory 2, while containing general information about the supportive relationship, does not specifically address the issue of listening or the Parent's experiences in detention.\n\nChoice: 1"
