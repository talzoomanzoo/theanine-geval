    "prediction": "Explanation: The current dialogue context involves a discussion about Co-worker A's efforts to be more responsible and reliable, with Co-worker B mentioning Co-worker A's past success as a leader. MEMORY 1 directly relates to the dialogue by connecting Co-worker A's previous leadership and determination to their ongoing efforts to be more disciplined. Meanwhile, MEMORY 2 provides additional context and support for Co-worker A's overall personal development and challenges but does not specifically highlight the connection to the leadership example as MEMORY 1 does. Thus, MEMORY 1 is more relevant and helpful in responding to the last utterance of the dialogue, which mentions Co-worker A's success as a leader.\n\nChoice: 1"
