    "prediction": "Explanation: The key issue in the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT is Co-worker A's plan to \"steal and hide away\" the bride because they love her. Co-worker B responds by explaining that love involves respecting choices and feelings, highlighting respect rather than force. MEMORY 1 includes a comparison of Co-worker A borrowing a pencil to their feelings of love, which is relevant to the guilt Co-worker A feels and the need for them to recognize boundaries and respect. MEMORY 2 focuses on Co-worker B's support and admiration, but it doesn't address Co-worker A's problematic thinking in this context. Therefore, MEMORY 1 is more relevant and helpful in providing a foundation for Co-worker B to continue guiding the conversation toward understanding the importance of boundaries and respect in relationships.\n\nChoice: 1"
