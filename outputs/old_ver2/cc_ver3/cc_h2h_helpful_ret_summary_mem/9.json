    "prediction": "Explanation: The current dialogue context centers around Classmate A expressing their enjoyment of carpentry and Classmate B's interest in learning about how Classmate A got into it. Both Memory 1 and Memory 2 mention aspects of Classmate A's pursuits and dreams but do not specify any information directly related to carpentry. However, both memories provide context on the supportive nature of their relationship and Classmate A's pursuits into new ventures, which might offer indirect relevance to the discussion of fulfilling careers. Memory 2, with its focus on Classmate B's supportiveness and the potential for collaboration, is slightly more aligned with Classmate A's motivations and interests, thus offering more relevant context for a conversation around careers and personal fulfillment.\n\nChoice: 2"
