    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides a more comprehensive recap of Co-worker A and Co-worker B's relationship and history. It emphasizes Co-worker B's supportive nature and the past instance when Co-worker A borrowed a pencil and felt guilty, which directly ties into the current dialogue about feeling guilty over intentions regarding the bride. This provides context for Co-worker B to draw parallels between Co-worker A's feelings of guilt and reconsidering their actions. MEMORY 2 reiterates the pencil incident but adds less overall context about their relationship dynamics compared to MEMORY 1.\n\nChoice: 1"
