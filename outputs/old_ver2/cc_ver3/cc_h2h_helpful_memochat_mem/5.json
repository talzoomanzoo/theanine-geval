    "prediction": "Explanation: The current context reveals a situation involving accusations of an affair and potential career damage, which reflects a conflict between the classmates. The relevant information here would address relationship dynamics, trust, or past instances impacting trust. Memory 1 talks about potential infatuation and positive feelings in relation to the classmates' interactions, which contrasts heavily with the conflict presented. Memory 2 doesn't directly address dating or relationship issues either but aligns more with professional aspirations and support, which can slightly relate to the misunderstanding being about a business meeting rather than a personal affair. Thus, neither Memory is directly helpful, but Memory 2 is slightly more related due to the professional implications.\n\nChoice: 2"
