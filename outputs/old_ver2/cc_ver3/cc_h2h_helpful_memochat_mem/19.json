    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more relevant because it touches on Neighbors A's frustration and desire for perfection, which relates to their current feelings of being stuck in a job and upset at work. It offers insight into Neighbors A's personality and persistence, which can be alluded to in Neighbors B's response. This makes it more relevant than MEMORY 1, which focuses on the support between the neighbors without addressing the current conversation topic.\n\nChoice: 2"
