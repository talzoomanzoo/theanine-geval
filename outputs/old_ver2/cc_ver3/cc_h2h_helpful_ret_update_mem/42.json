    "prediction": "Explanation: The current dialogue context involves Classmates A asking Classmates B how they found out something about their past and expressing concern that they hadn't told anyone. The helpful MEMORY should be relevant to this conversation about past and fitting in. MEMORY 1 contains information on how Classmates A was nervous about fitting in, and how that links to their relationship with Classmates B. Both MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 mention Classmates A's curiosity and openness to taking risks but MEMORY 1 provides a clearer link to the context of wanting to fit in and the history between the two classmates. \n\nChoice: 1"
