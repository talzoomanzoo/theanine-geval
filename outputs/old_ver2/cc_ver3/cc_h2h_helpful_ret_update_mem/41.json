    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 aligns more closely with the content of the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It directly addresses Co-worker A's progress and change in behavior, which is a major point being discussed. Specifically, it highlights the acknowledgment of past mistakes, the change in behavior, and ties the current promotion to this progress and potential for success, which would be relevant for Co-worker B to keep in mind when responding. MEMORY 2 contains more general supportive statements and context about past work, which, while somewhat relevant, do not tie in as directly with the specific conversation at hand about Co-worker A's promotion and past irresponsibility.\n\nChoice: 1"
