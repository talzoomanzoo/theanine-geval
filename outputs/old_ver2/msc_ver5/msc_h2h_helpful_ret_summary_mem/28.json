PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is not helpful in that context.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker A is a student who likes English in school and plays in the marching band.\nSpeaker A's parents are teachers.\nSpeaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you.\nSpeaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them\nSpeaker A: IN MY HOME?! A TREE? That was not at all what I was thinking. Do they grow well indoors? I am intrigued. \nSpeaker B: Well if you want to make it like a proper garden experience then I would suggest going all in, and go for the best most authentic looking items you could get \nSpeaker A: Wow! Ok! This is sounding like a bigger undertaking! Should I embrace bugs in the home if they help the plants or am I getting wild?\nSpeaker B: Well from my experince bugs do the complete opposite and don't help at all, so avoid that at all costs! Fertilizers are the way to go to help with growth.\nSpeaker A: Oh man. I have lots to learn. What is the lifespan of a plum tree?\nSpeaker B: around 10 to 15 years but if you take care of them I'm sure you could get 20 out of it.\nSpeaker A: Now we are also talking commitment! This is not how I expected my day to go! I am excited, yet so nervous! \nSpeaker B: It doesn't take too much time to do per day so after school give it a little water and that should keep them in great way. Speaking off school how are you getting on? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden. Speaker B is working on a teleportation machine that is currently small and requires substantial energy sources. Speaker B mentions the Chinese advancements in thermal nuclear generators and the need for a Manhattan Project for alternative energy.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more helpful because it provides relevant information about Speaker A and B's interests in gardening and space exploration, which ties into the current dialogue about gardening at home. It also reiterates the detail from the previous dialogue summary that Speaker A's parents are teachers, reinforcing its consistency with known information. MEMORY 1, while interesting for its detail about teleportation and nuclear generators, does not contribute additional context to the gardening discussion in Speaker B's response or provide helpful information that is directly applicable to the current topics being discussed.\n\nChoice: 2"
