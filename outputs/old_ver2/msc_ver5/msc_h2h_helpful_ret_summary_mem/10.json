PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is not helpful in that context.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\nSpeaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok? \nSpeaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish?\nSpeaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus!\nSpeaker B: Oh that sounds absolutely fabulous. Are you going to get a free dessert, as well? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.

Speaker B loves the beach and Mediterranean food.\n6.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides additional context about Speaker A experiencing a fire incident and handling it (even though this is unrelated to the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT). However, MEMORY 2 provides a clear and relevant piece of information that Speaker A gets two free meals per week, which directly answers Speaker B's question about whether Speaker A will get a free dessert as part of their free meal benefit. MEMORY 2 ultimately reinforces the discussion about the benefits Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant which is directly relevant to the current question posed by Speaker B.\n\nChoice: 2"
