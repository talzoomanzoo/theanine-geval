I imagine your parents are so proud. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science, and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics. \nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities. \nSpeaker B majoring in linguistics causes Speaker A to be interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\n3. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n4. Speaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\n5. Speaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\n6.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides useful context about Speaker A's interest in teaching computer science and robotics, which aligns with the current dialogue context where Speaker A expresses a desire to teach robotics someday. It also provides background on Speaker Bâ€™s academic focus and career considerations, which helps in understanding Speaker B's stress about career decisions. MEMORY 2 provides similar details, but MEMORY 1 is slightly more directly relevant to the current dialogue context without including less relevant additional details about Speaker B's volunteering.\n\nChoice: 1"
