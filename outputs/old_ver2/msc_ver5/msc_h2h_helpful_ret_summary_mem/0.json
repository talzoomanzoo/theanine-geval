PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is not helpful in that context.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker A is older and has eight grandchildren.\nSpeaker A is getting their hair dyed turquoise by their youngest grandchild, who wants to pursue hairdressing as a profession.\nSpeaker A has a granddaughter who is a cosmetologist and helped dye their hair in streaks.\nSpeaker A's granddaughter is 14 years old and has dreams of starting her own salon or working at a high-end salon in a big city.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\nSpeaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing?  \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker A mentions having eight grandchildren and already having blue hair. Speaker B has an oldest nephew who is about to turn 14.\n2.

    "prediction": "Explanation: In this context, the most helpful memory would contain relevant information about both Speaker A's and Speaker B's interests and past experiences related to travel, family, and books, which have been discussed in the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT and the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY. Both Memories provide some relevant information about Speaker A's grandchildren and their mutual interest in travel. However, Memory 1 includes details about Speaker A's and B's family, which may better address Speaker A's query about Speaker B's nephew and provide context around their family dynamics.\n\nChoice: 1"
