PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is not helpful in that context.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker B is a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks.\nSpeaker B's job involves motivating people to be successful and follow their dreams.\nSpeaker B got into motivational speaking because they needed it themselves to battle depression and anxiety.\nSpeaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \nSpeaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!).\nSpeaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol\nSpeaker B: I am up for the challenge! I have a few tricks up my sleeve to deal with people like you.\nSpeaker A: Oh geez that makes me sound difficult.lol  Do you have any new speeches coming up?\nSpeaker B: Nope, I just cleared my schedule until the Alps marathon that you're training for. It's just you and me until you break that finish line. I'm going to start sending you a motivational quote every morning at 4 am when I want you to wake up. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B has run a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding. This experience led Speaker A to seek advice on how to recover from marathon training. Speaker A then invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and planning to meet at the beach at 0600. Speaker B got into motivational speaking because they needed it themselves to battle depression and anxiety, which was suggested by Speaker A to combine with something more active to avoid dwelling on negative thoughts. Speaker B, who travels frequently for work and misses their wife and kids, also finds solace in fishing and the outdoors, similar to their background in San Francisco.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600.\n2. Speaker B has run a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding.\n3. Speaker A is training for marathons and seeking advice on how to recover.\n4. Speaker B is a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks.\n5. Speaker A is a runner who is working on improving their mile time and training for a marathon.\n6. Speaker B's job involves motivating people to be successful and follow their dreams.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains information about Speaker Bâ€™s previous marathon experience, their background, and insight into their motivations and personal life. This is relevant to the dialogue, as Speaker B is supporting Speaker A in training for a marathon with motivational speeches and strategies. This can be useful for Speaker A to understand Speaker B's deep empathy and strategies for motivation, making Speaker B relatable and inspiring. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 mostly repeats general information without adding personal depth relevant to the immediate exchange. \n\nChoice: 1"
