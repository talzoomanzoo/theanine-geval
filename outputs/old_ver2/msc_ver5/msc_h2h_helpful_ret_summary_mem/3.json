    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 contains a broader range of information relevant to the current dialogue, such as plans to travel together, the need to save money, and discussions about differences between Sweden and the US. These details can contribute to a richer and more nuanced conversation about planning the trip and things to see in Sweden. While MEMORY 1 provides specific information about the cousin and Speaker B's suggestion about volcanoes, MEMORY 2's additional points about fond memories and differences in culture could lead to more in-depth discussion about the trip.\n\nChoice: 2"
