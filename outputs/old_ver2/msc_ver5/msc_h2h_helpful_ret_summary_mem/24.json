    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain sufficient quantity of useful information, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT. PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is not helpful in that context.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring.\nBoth speakers value good grades and believe it can lead to better job opportunities.\nSpeaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\nSpeaker A advises Speaker B to take breaks and prioritize their own happiness and well-being.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go?\nSpeaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \nSpeaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on?\nSpeaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B is excelling in the sports medicine class, causing Speaker A to struggle with maintaining good grades and only excel in gym.\nSpeaker B and Speaker A both find history class boring and overwhelming, with Speaker B eager to finish school to escape their mother's strictness.\nSpeaker B is pressured to maintain straight A's in sports medicine to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring.\n2. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n3. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n4. Speaker B has been getting all A's in the sports medicine class.\n5. Speaker A wishes to get better grades and is hopeful for a soccer scholarship.\n6. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more helpful because it includes relevant context that can help Speaker B respond appropriately: it highlights Speaker B's experience in sports medicine and their pressure to maintain good grades, which are important to understanding their perspective on exams. It also provides context about Speaker A's struggles with history class and their aspirations, which align with the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT. MEMORY 1, while it mentions Speaker B's performance in sports medicine, doesn't provide as comprehensive a background regarding both speakers' academic motivations or upcoming exams.\n\nChoice: 2"
