    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain sufficient quantity of useful information, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT. PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is not helpful in that context.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker B has a lot of kids, all grown up now and with kids of their own.\nSpeaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\nSpeaker B mentions having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own.\nSpeaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\nSpeaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\nSpeaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\nSpeaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call!\nSpeaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip?  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A is a librarian and loves kids, mentioning having 3 children. This makes Speaker A busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. Consequently, Speaker B, who has a lot of kids all grown up with kids of their own, enjoys spending time with their grandkids at the park. This led Speaker B to take their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description: Speaker B is a librarian who had a good day playing with his son's kids. He cherishes moments spent with his children and grandchildren. Speaker B's mother had the same profession as Speaker A. Speaker B has 3 grown-up children who mostly take the subway to work.\n\nRelationship Description: Speaker B and Speaker A share a mutual understanding and agreement on the challenges and rewards of being a librarian. They discuss the importance of libraries and the decline in children's interest in reading. Speaker A is proud to teach his youngest child the flute, which Speaker B finds interesting.\n\nEvent Description: Speaker B had a great time with his son and grandkids at the park. Speaker A thought about taking his grandkids to a library, and they discussed the relevance of paper books in the digital age. Speaker A's youngest child asked to learn the flute, inspired by Lizzo. Speaker B enjoys the creative ways libraries are staying relevant and mentioned a trip to the park with his grandkids.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides information directly relevant to the current dialogue context, including details about their family structures and the fishing trip tradition, which is precisely what Speaker B is referencing in the last utterance. It directly connects to the idea of the annual fishing trip with the grandkids, something which Speaker B is currently discussing with Speaker A. This makes MEMORY 1 very helpful in responding appropriately to the current dialogue.\n\nMEMORY 2, on the other hand, provides additional background on Speaker B's family and activities, like playing with grandkids and enjoying time at the park, but it does not directly relate to the concept of the annual fishing trip, which is crucial for an appropriate response to the current dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 1"
