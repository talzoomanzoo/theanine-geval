    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain sufficient quantity of useful information, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT. PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is not helpful in that context.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker A recently gave birth to twins and is a stay-at-home mom.\nSpeaker A wants more children and feels lonely due to their husband's frequent traveling.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\nSpeaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it.\nSpeaker A: Cool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot. What is your favorite part about camping?\nSpeaker B: I love being out in the wilderness and sleeping under the stars in the fresh air. It makes you realize how beautiful life is and how small we really are in comparison to the universe.\nSpeaker A: I miss doing that! I have done lots of picnics with my family but it's been a long time since I've slept in a tent! Looking forward to it again when the kids are older. Where was the last place you went? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout. Speaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat.\nSpeaker B is busy with scouts, school, work, and tennis, but willing to take vacation days for the retreat. Speaker B is considering attending a local community college for the first couple of years.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nSpeaker A is a stay-at-home mom who recently gave birth to twins. She used to work at IKEA in Sweden for twelve years before becoming a stay-at-home mom. She plays tennis every week, goes to church regularly, and is interested in having a lot of children in the future. Her husband travels frequently, which makes her feel lonely.\n\nRelationship Description:\nThe relationship between Speaker A and Speaker B is friendly and supportive. Speaker B shows empathy towards Speaker A's loneliness and shares his own experiences with volunteering and scouting. They engage in conversations about work, hobbies, and future plans with a level of intimacy and understanding.\n\nEvent Description:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B discuss volunteering opportunities at the church, with Speaker B showing interest in participating despite his busy schedule with work, school, and scouting. They talk about upcoming church retreats, with Speaker A suggesting that Speaker B join for a calming experience. Speaker A also mentions managing school, work, and her twins, while Speaker B shares his plans to achieve the Eagle Scout badge for college applications. They bond over shared experiences and future aspirations, creating a supportive and engaging dialogue.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 offers more context on Speaker A's personal life, including her history with IKEA, her current situation as a stay-at-home mom with twins, and her feelings of loneliness due to her husband's frequent travels. It also describes the relationship dynamics between Speaker A and Speaker B, which could be helpful in guiding Speaker B's responses with empathy and understanding. MEMORY 1, while informative about Speaker B's activities and future plans, lacks context on Speaker A's side and does not contribute much useful information for responding to the last utterance of the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nChoice: 2"
