PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is not helpful in that context.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix.\nSpeaker B has a son and enjoys reading books, particularly about animals.\nSpeaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read.\nSpeaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting? \nSpeaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far.\nSpeaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes. \nSpeaker A: why don't you like books like that?\nSpeaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B's fascination with animals allows them to understand Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals. This is because Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves with technology or watching TV. Additionally, Speaker A enjoys watching movies with their grandchildren. Speaker B, on the other hand, has a young son and finds solace in reading books, especially those about animals. This interest in animals is shared with Speaker A, who mentions watching movies with their grandchildren.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Reading and Education', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the importance of reading and education.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: Yep, I loved watching his historic streak, so maybe it's a nostalgia thing.  I know Ken is a big reader, so was Alex.  That was one of the reasons I got so into books growing up. ### Speaker B: That's a great memory for you then. Someone who gave you the drive or fascination with books. Reading and education is so important to a successful life and career. I try to instill that in my son.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. ###Speaker B: It's nice to have a break.

    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 provides context about Speaker B's fascination with animals and the fact that Speaker A enjoys movies, which could be relevant since Speaker B is inquiring if there is a movie adaptation of the book Speaker A is reading. On the other hand, Memory 2 focuses on the importance of reading and education, which is less directly related to the specific question Speaker B is asking about a movie adaptation of a book.\n\nChoice: 1"
