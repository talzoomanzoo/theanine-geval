    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more helpful because it provides context about Speaker A's and B's interests in cooking and food, which aligns with the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where they are discussing recipes and wine preferences. Additionally, MEMORY 2 reveals Speaker A's affinity for animals and volunteering at shelters, which ties back to the start of the current conversation about puppies and an animal shelter. MEMORY 1, while also containing relevant information about preferences for puppies and cooking-related experiences, does not provide as much detail about their food-related interactions which is the current focus of the conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
