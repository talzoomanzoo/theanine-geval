Only one of my sons loves Chinese food as much as I do. The other really just likes Italian food, so it can be difficult to decide where to go. ### Speaker A: It sounds like an international fight!!  My sons just got back from studying abroad. They are leaving again in a few months.  ### Speaker B: It's nice that you got to spend some time with them. I'd be so worried if my boys traveled so far away. Luckily it will be a long time before they're old enough. ### Speaker A: It's stressful and I worry all the time, but I am happy for them.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 both contain information that suggests Speaker A has sons studying in Spain and mentions a Spanish girlfriend. However, MEMORY 1 adds an additional detail relevant to the current dialogue, that one son is possibly secretive or gay, which might impact Speaker A's thoughts about meeting the girlfriend and adds depth for context. MEMORY 2 provides extra contextual conversation but doesn't add more specific helpfulness to the immediate question about the potential likeability of the girlfriend.\n\nChoice: 1"
