The only similarity will be the screaming girls in the audience.lol ### Speaker B: Hehe… true! By the way do you get to eat for free at the restaurant you work at? ### Speaker A: We get two free meals per week and we can take home any left over baked goods at the end of the night so they don't go to waste.  It's a nice perk for sure. ### Speaker B: Wow… that’s awesome! I’ve always thought that’s a gr8 perk myself! ### Speaker A: Yeah, it's better than just a discount cause I shouldn't eat out too much since it's expensive and it saves me a little money on meals.

I usually work a double on Saturday and I work Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday 8 hours each roughly.  It all depends on how busy we get.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited!

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 both contain similar information regarding the restaurant perks, including the two free meals per week and the possibility of taking home leftover baked goods. This information aligns well with the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Speaker A mentions trying a new dish for free. Both memories also include details about Speaker A's work schedule, which is not directly relevant to the dessert question but does not conflict with the dialogue. Thus, the memories provide context about the benefits Speaker A enjoys at the restaurant, which can help support the discussion about free desserts.\n\nChoice: tie"
