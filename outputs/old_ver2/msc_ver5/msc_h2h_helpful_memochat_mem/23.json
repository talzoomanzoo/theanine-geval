PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is not helpful in that context.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker A recently moved to a new city and has two older brothers.\nSpeaker A has recently received a call for a job interview and is excited about it.\nSpeaker A is new to the city and has not been out much since arriving.\nSpeaker A has had flustered moments in past interviews but believes in staying calm.\nSpeaker A is applying for a project coordinator role at a charity but aspires to become a project manager in the future.\nSpeaker A finds job searching challenging and hopes to settle in the new city soon with a steady income.\nSpeaker A is preparing for an upcoming interview and is nervous about it.\nSpeaker A is nervous about an upcoming interview and wishes for a government job like Speaker B's.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\nSpeaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\nSpeaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\nSpeaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.\nSpeaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe?\nSpeaker B: There is some weird chemical mix that I really do not mess with.  It is easy to clean up.  I try to stay away from this part of the movies.  I know what it should look like and that we want to keep everyone safe when using the fake blood.\nSpeaker A: Chemicals!  Do the actors hate working with it then?  I can imagine they are a pretty high maintenance bunch.  Do they worry about the blood messing with their looks?\nSpeaker B: Our actors are pretty amateur.  No big name ones so they are really good to work with.  Hey, how about you?  How is your interview practice going?  I am pretty sure you be excellent during it! \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B enjoys painting and taking naps, while Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them.

Shows and movies are my favorite past time.  I love horror movies.  I think it's so cool you make horror movies with your dad.  How do you come up with the plot to your movies? ### Speaker B: We have a lot of weird, creative conversations. We always have in my family. We used to write parts of stories and then swap them half-way through so that the other person could take over the story and add different creative elements to it. That's honestly how we still come up with some of our ideas. ### Speaker A: That's terrific!  Have you seen any good horror movies recently?  Personally, I prefer the classics like Halloween or Friday the 13th. ### Speaker B: Yes, we watch a lot of horror movies in our family. Our favorite right now is the Conjuring series of films and their spin-offs. The newest one just came out and it was ok. Have you seen any horror movies lately? ### Speaker A: Yes, but just the classics like I mentioned.  I'm not too keen on the modern ones, they just don't make them like they used to.  Who knows, maybe one day I'll be watching your creation in the theatres.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time?

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more helpful because it provides information about the creative process of making horror movies that Speaker B engages in with their dad, including how they come up with plots through creative storytelling. This aligns with the current dialogue context where Speaker A is curious about making horror movies and asks for interesting stories and processes involved. MEMORY 1, while mentioning horror movies, mostly focuses on Speaker A's beliefs and preferences, which doesn't add much value to the context of sharing stories from movie-making experiences.\n\nChoice: 2"
