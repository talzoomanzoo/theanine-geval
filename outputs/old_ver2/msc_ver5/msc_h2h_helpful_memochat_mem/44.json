PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is not helpful in that context.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker B is a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks.\nSpeaker B's job involves motivating people to be successful and follow their dreams.\nSpeaker B got into motivational speaking because they needed it themselves to battle depression and anxiety.\nSpeaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \nSpeaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better.

It's just you and me until you break that finish line. I'm going to start sending you a motivational quote every morning at 4 am when I want you to wake up. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B has run a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding. This experience led Speaker A to seek advice on how to recover from marathon training. Speaker A then invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and planning to meet at the beach at 0600. Speaker B got into motivational speaking because they needed it themselves to battle depression and anxiety, which was suggested by Speaker A to combine with something more active to avoid dwelling on negative thoughts. Speaker B, who travels frequently for work and misses their wife and kids, also finds solace in fishing and the outdoors, similar to their background in San Francisco.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Motivational Speaking', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker B shares about being a motivational speaker and how it helps them overcome personal struggles.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: I'm a motivational speaker! I get invited to different schools and conferences to give a little pep talk! ### Speaker A: That sounds amazing. Do you motivate people to be successful? Do go after their dreams? That kind of a thing? ### Speaker B: Basically yes. And to strive forwards through hardships. Just like your injury! ### Speaker A: We all go through struggles. Sometimes we need people to pull us up out of the abyss. How did you get into motivational speaking? ### Speaker B: I think it began because I needed motivational speaking myself. I've always needed to battle bouts of depression and anxiety. Motivational speeches and being in nature both help me to this day.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: How did the speech go?

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides a more comprehensive context related to the Alps marathon, the shared experience of running, and Speaker Bâ€™s approach to using motivational speaking as a means to combat depression and anxiety. It also highlights their shared plans to train together, which is directly relevant to the current dialogue about Speaker B's schedule being clear for the marathon training. MEMORY 2, while still relevant, focuses more on generic information about motivational speaking and lacks the specific details about the marathon training and their shared commitment. Therefore, MEMORY 1 is more helpful for Speaker A to respond in the context of Speaker B focusing on the marathon and working together.\n\nChoice: 1"
