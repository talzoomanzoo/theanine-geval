PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is not helpful in that context.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring.\nBoth speakers value good grades and believe it can lead to better job opportunities.\nSpeaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\nSpeaker A advises Speaker B to take breaks and prioritize their own happiness and well-being.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go?\nSpeaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \nSpeaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on?\nSpeaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B is excelling in the sports medicine class, causing Speaker A to struggle with maintaining good grades and only excel in gym.\nSpeaker B and Speaker A both find history class boring and overwhelming, with Speaker B eager to finish school to escape their mother's strictness.\nSpeaker B is pressured to maintain straight A's in sports medicine to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Studying and Exams', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B talk about their studies, exams, and grades.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: No, definitely not.  Maybe you can make it out to one of my games sometime? ### Speaker B: I would love that. Hopefully I can make it this weekend. I have an exam on Friday and then hopefully I can make it there before your game. ### Speaker A: Which exam?  I had a history test last week and it was horrible.  I wish my teacher was better, or at least made the topic interesting.  It's so boring in his class that I have a hard time paying attention. ### Speaker B: It is for my sport medicine. It is the last one of the class I have made A's all year so hopefully I can pass this one also and I'll be done. ### Speaker A: Oh nice!  I wish that I could get all A's.  I'm more of a B and occasional C student.  The only guaranteed A I have is in gym, haha ### Speaker B: I think everyone gets an A in gym. I have studied really hard to get those As I want to pass with good grades. I figure it would help me get a good job afterwards. ### Speaker A: I'm sure it will.  My sister got good grades in school and ended up with a great teaching job.  I know it's not the same, but it definitely helped her.  I still am hoping that I can get a soccer scholarship, because there's no way that I'll get one for my academics. ### Speaker B: Just keep at it and try your hardest. You never know you might surprise yourself' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? ###Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 includes information relevant to the context of studying, exams, and past experiences with poor teachers, aligning well with Speaker B's understanding and support in the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It reflects the relationship of previous academic challenges and offers contextual advice, fitting the present conversation. Meanwhile, MEMORY 1 contains more background details about struggles with maintaining grades but doesn't provide specific helpful insights related to the CURRENT DIALOGUE's focus on preparing for finals, exams, and studying habits.\n\nChoice: 2"
