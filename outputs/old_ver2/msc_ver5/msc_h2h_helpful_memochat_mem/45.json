PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is not helpful in that context.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\nSpeaker A enjoys camping and hiking, mentioning setting up a hammock at their campsite.\nSpeaker A is looking for a job and new camping gear, specifically a hammock.\nSpeaker A plans to leave a hammock by the river for anyone to use at a hidden spot off the main hiking trail.\nSpeaker A has a portable hammock for the hike and asks if Speaker B will bring theirs.\nSpeaker A decides not to bring the hammock due to extra weight in their bag.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for.\nSpeaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for?\nSpeaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\nSpeaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise? \nSpeaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows.\nSpeaker A: That sounds wonderful! You'd get to just be out in nature all day. Sounds like a great job, especially if you're a bit introverted like me. That's why hiking is my favorite -- a good solitary activity. \nSpeaker B: Yes, I agree. What kind of hours would this new job have?\nSpeaker A: It's third shift, which isn't the greatest, but it pays a bit more than the other shifts, and I think I'll like getting off early in the morning. Then I can just go down and get in my hammock and have a nice relaxing moment after work. \nSpeaker B: Would you feel safe being out there all alone, possibly falling asleep? That just sounds a bit risky. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B enjoys camping, hiking, and is kind, caring, and hopeful for group equality. Speaker A plans to potentially visit the Columbia Trail and Ken Lockwood Gorge for a camping and hiking trip. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n\nSpeaker B enjoys camping, hiking, and is kind, caring, and hopeful for group equality.

    "prediction": "Explanation: \nMemory 1 provides information about Speaker A's interest in camping and hiking, their application to work at a grocery store, and their plan to use the earnings to buy camping gear such as a hammock. Memory 2, on the other hand, contains a specific past dialogue that confirms Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail, and also mentions their friend who previously worked there and enjoyed it. The detail that connects the job location to hiking trails is particularly relevant given the current dialogue's mention of hiking and a hammock, adding context to Speaker A's excitement about being able to relax in their hammock after work. Thus, Memory 2 offers more directly relevant details that provide context for the current discussion regarding the grocery store job and its location in relation to hiking, making it more helpful.\n\nChoice: 2"
