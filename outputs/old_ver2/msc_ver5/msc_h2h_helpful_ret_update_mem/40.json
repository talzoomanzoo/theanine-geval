PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is not helpful in that context.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker A recently gave birth to twins and is a stay-at-home mom.\nSpeaker A wants more children and feels lonely due to their husband's frequent traveling.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\nSpeaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it.\nSpeaker A: Cool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot. What is your favorite part about camping?\nSpeaker B: I love being out in the wilderness and sleeping under the stars in the fresh air. It makes you realize how beautiful life is and how small we really are in comparison to the universe.\nSpeaker A: I miss doing that! I have done lots of picnics with my family but it's been a long time since I've slept in a tent! Looking forward to it again when the kids are older. Where was the last place you went? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout. Speaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat.\nSpeaker B is busy with scouts, school, work, and tennis, but willing to take vacation days for the retreat. Speaker B is considering attending a local community college for the first couple of years.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat.\n2. Speaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout.\n3. Speaker B is busy with scouts, school, work, and tennis, but willing to take vacation days for the retreat.\n4. Speaker A is involved in church activities and mentioned a church retreat\n5. Speaker B is a member of the boy scouts and works at a fast food place\n6. Speaker B plans to earn the Eagle Scout badge for college applications.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: For Speaker B to respond appropriately to Speaker A's question about their last camping location, information relevant to camping and boy scouts is most useful. MEMORY 2 provides additional details about Speaker B's plans to earn the Eagle Scout badge, which could be useful in further conversation about Boy Scouts or camping experiences, aligning with Speaker A's interest in Boy Scouts activities. The fact that Speaker B is a Life Scout and involved in many activities is already covered in both memories, but MEMORY 2 gives a more comprehensive picture that may lead to a more in-depth and natural response.\n\nChoice: 2"
