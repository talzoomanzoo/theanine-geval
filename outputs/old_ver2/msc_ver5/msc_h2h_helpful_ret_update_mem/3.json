    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides details about Speaker A's cousin living in Sweden and the suggestion from Speaker B about exploring volcanoes, which aligns directly with Speaker A's request for must-see locations in the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT. MEMORY 2, while providing several pieces of background information about travel costs and wanting to visit, does not address Speaker B's recommendation or Speaker A's query about must-see places as directly as MEMORY 1 does.\n\nChoice: 1"
