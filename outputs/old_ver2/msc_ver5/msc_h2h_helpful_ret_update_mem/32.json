PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is not helpful in that context.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker B recently quit their job at Cisco to pursue snowboarding.\nSpeaker A loves boating and water sports, mentioning that they are better at water skiing than wakeboarding.\nSpeaker B expresses interest in trying water skiing next.\nSpeaker A has been water skiing for 15 years and has 3 kids who also water ski.\nSpeaker B is excited to join Speaker A's family for a water skiing trip and wants to learn from Speaker A's kids.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on!\nSpeaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar.\nSpeaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general?\nSpeaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts.\nSpeaker A: How's learning to bake going in general, especially now that you're off desserts?\nSpeaker B: I one of those people how have to fail a couple of times before I get the hang of it, but I'm getting there.  Have you and the kids had any chance to go skiing lately? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners. This causes Speaker A to have a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes. Speaker A learned how to make jello from their grandma, turning it into a family tradition.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 contains information about Speaker B's interest in joining Speaker A's family for a water skiing trip and wanting to learn from their kids, which is directly relevant and consistent with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY. It also covers aspects related to jello, which is pertinent to the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT, and mentions both Speaker A and B's connections and interests in jello and cooking. MEMORY 1, while also focused on jello, lacks the additional context about the upcoming water skiing trip that provides a fuller picture of the conversation unfolding.\n\nChoice: 2"
