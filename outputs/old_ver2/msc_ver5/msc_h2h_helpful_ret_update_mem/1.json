PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is not helpful in that context.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker A enjoys cruising and has a favorite club in school.\nSpeaker A knows how to swim since the age of 5.\nSpeaker A has planned a cruise to the Caribbeans.\nSpeaker B is afraid of cruises because they can't swim.\nSpeaker A is not nervous about going on a cruise.\nSpeaker A recommends hiking and exploring the local area for those who can't swim.\nSpeaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\nSpeaker A plans to travel to the Caribbean for their next trip.\nSpeaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend.

Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B, who does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies, wants Speaker A to teach them how to swim and programming. Speaker B also enjoys cruising in their car while listening to punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.

Speaker B is afraid of cruises because they can't swim.\n6. Speaker B is looking forward to eating a pizza burger in a pool with punk music playing.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around Speaker A's playlist for a meetup that includes pool and programming study activities, and Speaker B's hope to learn swimming. Speaker A reassures that they can teach swimming, and Speaker B expresses interest in joining a future cruise. MEMORY 2 contains explicit references to Speaker B enjoying punk music, a detail directly relevant to the playlist Speaker A created, and it mentions Speaker B's fear of cruises due to their inability to swim, aligning with previous discussions. It also covers all key points of the conversation: learning swimming and programming, and discussing cruise potential. MEMORY 1 contains these points but is somewhat disjointed and less direct in its relevance, mentioning extra details like snorkeling plans that are less pertinent to the immediate context. Also, MEMORY 1 introduces potential confusion with an unclear statement about Speaker A's activities causing plans, which is less structured. Overall, MEMORY 2 provides a clearer and more focused summary relevant to the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 2"
