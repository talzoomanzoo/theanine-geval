PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is not helpful in that context.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\nSpeaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited!

I will send you a pic later, ok? \nSpeaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish?\nSpeaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus!\nSpeaker B: Oh that sounds absolutely fabulous. Are you going to get a free dessert, as well? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.

Speaker A's schedule at the restaurant includes working doubles on Saturdays and 8-hour shifts on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.\n6. Speaker A is an omnivore.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains information about Speaker A's restaurant work and schedule, which is relevant to the context of discussing their work benefits and the excitement about trying the new dish. However, the mention of a fire incident, although interesting, is not directly relevant to the current dialogue about the meals and desserts. MEMORY 2 also has similar relevant information about the restaurant work, benefits, and schedule. However, it includes additional information about Speaker A being an omnivore, which might subtly enhance understanding of their excitement for chicken parmesan. Though not directly answering the dessert question, it provides context for Speaker A's food preferences which are more relevant than the fire incident.\n\nChoice: 2"
