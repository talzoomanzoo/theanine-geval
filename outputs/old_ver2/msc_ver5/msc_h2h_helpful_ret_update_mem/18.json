    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain sufficient quantity of useful information, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT. PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is not helpful in that context.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker B is 26 years old, works 12 hours a day, has a background in Humanities but now works as a law clerk.\nSpeaker B is currently working and mentioned the importance of taking breaks from work.\nSpeaker B is considering looking for a new job for higher pay but is comfortable at the current job.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college?\nSpeaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position. \nSpeaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it?\nSpeaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \nSpeaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living.\nSpeaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime?\nSpeaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with.\nSpeaker A: Sounds great! Now the tough question: when do you have time? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket but now plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week. They are a member of a soccer team and enjoy playing in tournaments. \nSpeaker A is a college student majoring in Humanities, not currently employed but used to work part-time at a supermarket.

Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n5. Speaker A is a fan of Arsenal and enjoys watching international teams play.\n6. Speaker A is a college student studying Humanities and wants to finish college before looking for a job.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 contain relevant information about Speaker A's involvement with soccer and their studies, as well as some information on Speaker B's soccer interest. However, MEMORY 2 contains additional details that are particularly useful for Speaker B's response to finding time for a casual soccer game. Specifically, it mentions that Speaker B is a fan of Manchester United and gives more context about Speaker A as a college student who wants to finish college before looking for a job. This extra context could help Speaker B respond more fully to Speaker A's question about finding time.\n\nChoice: 2"
