    "prediction": "Explanation: The task is to determine which MEMORY provides more relevant and helpful information for responding to Speaker B's last utterance in the current dialogue context, which is about guest passes to the pool, working as a lifeguard, and lunch plans. \n\nMEMORY 1 provides information about Speaker B's current job as a lifeguard and their consideration of a career change to IT, which aligns with the dialogue mentioning them being a lifeguard and offering guest passes. This could be relevant if the conversation takes a turn towards discussing career plans during the lunch meeting.\n\nMEMORY 2 provides more extensive details about Speaker B's background in karate and football, involvement in college classes, interest in IT work, and interests like watching \"Jaws.\" However, it doesn't strongly relate to the immediate context of lifeguarding or lunch plans mentioned in the current dialogue. \n\nTherefore, while MEMORY 2 contains more detailed information about Speaker B, MEMORY 1 is more directly relevant to the current dialogue context because it touches upon the lifeguarding job that was mentioned by Speaker B.\n\nChoice: 1"
