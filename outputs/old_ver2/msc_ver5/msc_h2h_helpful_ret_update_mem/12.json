    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain sufficient quantity of useful information, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT. PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is not helpful in that context.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\nSpeaker A is living with their grandparents and helps them out.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science, and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics. \nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities. \nSpeaker B majoring in linguistics causes Speaker A to be interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n3. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n4. Speaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\n5. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n6. Speaker A is involved with a football league and is looking forward to playing games.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains relevant information that directly aligns with the Current Dialogue Context. It mentions that Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in robotics, which aligns with the part of the conversation where Speaker A expresses interest in teaching robotics. Additionally, it touches upon Speaker A's work at a pizza shop and their computer science studies, which matches the Previous Dialogue Summary. MEMORY 2, while containing some pertinent information, introduces additional details about Speaker B's volunteer experiences and Speaker A's involvement in a football league, which may not be directly useful for responding to the current dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 1"
