    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides more time-sensitive and relevant information to the current dialogue. It recalls Speaker B's concerns and feelings about attending festivals due to the pregnancy and the potential logistics involved with a small baby. Additionally, MEMORY 2 references Speaker A's mention of Drunky, which is directly relevant to the current conversation about Speaker A bringing Drunky along to the festival. These points are more aligned with the flow of the current dialogue than MEMORY 1, which contains some additional details about Speaker A's lifestyle and car, but does not add any helpful context to the current discussion about the festival.\n\nChoice: 2"
