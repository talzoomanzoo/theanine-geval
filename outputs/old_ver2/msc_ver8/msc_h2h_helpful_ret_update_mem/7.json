Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1.

Memory 2 provides relevant points but lacks the specific detail of Speaker A being a librarian. However, Memory 2 introduces the new detail about Speaker B's grandkids being interested in phones, which could relate to the current discussion of technology in the interaction.\n\nChoice: 2"
