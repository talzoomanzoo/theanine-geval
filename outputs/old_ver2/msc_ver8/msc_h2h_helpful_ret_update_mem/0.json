Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about?

    "prediction": "Explanation: \nMemory 1 provides information about Speaker A's eight grandchildren, which is a relevant connection to the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT where they talk about Speaker A's grandchild dying their hair and having career aspirations linked to cosmetology. It also mentions Speaker B's oldest nephew who is about to turn 14, which directly relates to Speaker A asking about Speaker Bâ€™s nephew. On the other hand, Memory 2 doesn't directly relate to the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT as well concerning the connection between their family discussions.\n\nChoice: 1"
