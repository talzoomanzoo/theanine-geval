Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities. \nSpeaker B majoring in linguistics causes Speaker A to be interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n3.
