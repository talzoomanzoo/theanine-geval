    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides more comprehensive information about Speaker B, including their background in karate and their varied interests. It mentions their intentions to change careers to IT and their serious relationship, offering insights that hint at Speaker B's life beyond the immediate conversation. This has contextual relevance, considering the offer of guest passes and discussing future plans over lunch. MEMORY 1, while similar in its reference to a career change, does not provide as rich of a context or personal connection details that MEMORY 2 does. The personal and casual nature of their relationship is better detailed in MEMORY 2, which could be helpful in a social arrangement like planning lunch after visiting the dojo.\n\nChoice: 2"
