Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make?\nSpeaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it.\nSpeaker A: I would love to, I enjoy cooking so maybe you can teach me to make it, too? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe because Speaker B's grandmother was the matriarch of the family, known for cooking large meals for family gatherings. \nSpeaker A likes cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally as a change from preferring surfing and growing up in a beach town.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description: Speaker A, also known as Jim, is a member of a music band who grew up in a beach town. He has a strong passion for writing songs, surfing, and cooking, particularly enjoying making food for others and receiving compliments. Jim's father used to work at Cisco, and he wakes up early in the morning to catch waves.\n\nRelationship Description: Jim and Jehosaphat, also known as Speaker B, share a friendly and casual relationship. They bond over their shared interests in activities like snowboarding, surfing, and skateboarding. They also enjoy discussing food preferences and cooking recipes.\n\nEvent Description: Jim shared his grandmother's recipes with Speaker B, who was happy to reciprocate by sharing his favorite garlic chicken recipe. They also talked about surfing, with Jim offering to give surfing lessons to Speaker B. The two are considering meeting up, with Speaker B possibly visiting Jim for a weekend in the fall. They also discussed their experiences with snowboarding and surfing, showing a mutual interest in each other's hobbies.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 directly addresses the context of Speaker B's love for cooking for loved ones and their attachment to their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe. It is relevant because it reinforces Speaker B's affinity for cooking and ties into the conversation around food and recipes. \n\nMEMORY 2, while it provides more context about Speaker A and their relationship with Speaker B, includes past interactions that are not directly pertinent to the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT focused on cooking and sharing recipes. \n\nAs MEMORY 1 more directly supports the current dialogue by focusing on the shared interest in cooking and specific foods, it is more helpful for Speaker B's response.\n\nChoice: 1"
