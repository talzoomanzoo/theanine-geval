Any must sees while I am there? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A's cousin recently moved to Sweden, which has sparked Speaker A's interest in visiting the country. This desire to visit Sweden is leading Speaker A to consider saving money by taking on a second part-time job. Additionally, Speaker B, who is from Sweden, suggested checking out the volcanoes in the country for a unique experience.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B discussed the differences between Sweden and the US, including coffee breaks.\n5. Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n6. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nMEMORY 1 provides specific information regarding Speaker B's previous suggestion to check out the volcanoes in Sweden. This is a direct connection to the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A is asking for \"must sees\" while planning their trip. The fact that Speaker B recommended the volcanoes as a unique experience is directly relevant and timely, allowing Speaker B to reiterate this suggestion or possibly add more. MEMORY 2 contains more general background information, which while useful for context, doesn't offer the same level of help in terms of specific recommendations for must-see attractions.\n\nChoice: 1"
