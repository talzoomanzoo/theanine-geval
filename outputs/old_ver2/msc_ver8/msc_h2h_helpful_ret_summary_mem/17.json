Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make?\nSpeaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it.\nSpeaker A: I would love to, I enjoy cooking so maybe you can teach me to make it, too? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe because Speaker B's grandmother was the matriarch of the family, known for cooking large meals for family gatherings. \nSpeaker A likes cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally as a change from preferring surfing and growing up in a beach town.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1.

Speaker A cooked steak, fried potatoes, and shrimp for dinner with their father.\n6. Speaker A enjoys surfing and offers to give Speaker B lessons.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 is more helpful because it contains relevant information that directly relates to the current dialogue context. It mentions Speaker A's interest in cooking new dishes and following recipes and also references Speaker Bâ€™s grandmother's garlic chicken recipe, which ties in directly with Speaker A's desire to learn how to make it. The additional context about Speaker B's grandmother emphasizing cooking large meals for family gatherings is consistent with the previous dialogue summary and enriches the understanding of why the recipe is valued by Speaker B. \n\nMEMORY 2, while providing more information about Speaker A's cooking experiences and interests, introduces elements not directly relevant to the current dialogue context and sidetracks from the immediate conversation about learning to cook the garlic chicken recipe.\n\nChoice: 1"
