    "prediction": "Explanation: In the current dialogue context, Speaker B asks Speaker A about encountering predators while camping. MEMORY 2 contains relevant information that Speaker A is comfortable around animals but is jumpy around bears, which directly addresses Speaker B's question about predators. This information is time-sensitive and enhances the appropriateness of Speaker A's response in the current dialogue. MEMORY 1, while it does mention being nervous about the Appalachian Trail and other shared interests, doesn't provide as direct and helpful information regarding the context of encountering predators as MEMORY 2 does.\n\nChoice: 2"
