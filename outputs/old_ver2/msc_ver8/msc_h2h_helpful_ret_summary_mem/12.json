    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain relevant and time-sensitive information, enabling the Speaker A to respond appropriately in the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT while accounting for how previous interactions may influence the present moment.\n\nNOTE:\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is to be regarded as an unhelpful memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\nSpeaker A is living with their grandparents and helps them out.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science, and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics. \nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities. \nSpeaker B majoring in linguistics causes Speaker A to be interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\n3. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n4. Speaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\n5. Speaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\n6. Speaker A is studying computer science and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a more comprehensive view of both Speaker A and Speaker B's current educational and career aspirations without introducing conflicting prior exchanges. It includes information about both their majors, Speaker B's volunteer interests, and reiterates Speaker A's ambitions in developing apps and teaching robotics. This context can help Speaker A to respond more empathetically and relevantly to Speaker B's concerns about job stability and career choices.\n\nChoice: 2"
