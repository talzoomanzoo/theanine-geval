Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\nSpeaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well.

You should definitely get your kids into it.\nSpeaker A: Cool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot.

But since you love the church so much having enough for a church choir sounds like a good idea! Have you had any luck finding volunteers? When is your next retreat? ### Speaker A: We've gotten some volunteers, but always need more!  Thank you for getting your scout troop involved.  We are having another retreat next month.  It'll be a youth retreat if you and your friends would be interested. ### Speaker B: That sounds like a great idea! I could use some of my vacation days at work and we could come to the retreat! ### Speaker A: They are always worth the time.  So spiritually uplifting!  I'll be having to bring the babies along, so I hope they won't fuss too much. ### Speaker B: I'm sure they will be just fine. They are probably going to be little angels. ### Speaker A: I think they can read each other's minds.  It always looks like they are plotting something! haha ### Speaker B: I've heard that twins are connected in ways that most siblings aren't. Something about them sharing a womb and all that.
