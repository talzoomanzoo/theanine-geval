I'm going to start sending you a motivational quote every morning at 4 am when I want you to wake up. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B has run a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding. This experience led Speaker A to seek advice on how to recover from marathon training. Speaker A then invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and planning to meet at the beach at 0600. Speaker B got into motivational speaking because they needed it themselves to battle depression and anxiety, which was suggested by Speaker A to combine with something more active to avoid dwelling on negative thoughts. Speaker B, who travels frequently for work and misses their wife and kids, also finds solace in fishing and the outdoors, similar to their background in San Francisco.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Motivational Speaking', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker B shares about being a motivational speaker and how it helps them overcome personal struggles.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: I'm a motivational speaker!

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 closely aligns with the current dialogue and previous dialogue summary by emphasizing Speaker B's focus on motivational speaking as a way to overcome personal challenges. This directly relates to the ongoing conversation about motivation, Speaker B's personal experiences with depression and anxiety, and how that adds value to their ability as a motivational speakerâ€”a relevant point Speaker B is currently making to Speaker A. Memory 1 includes relevant context about marathon training, but it diverges with additional information about family and personal activities that are not pertinent to the current focus of the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 2"
