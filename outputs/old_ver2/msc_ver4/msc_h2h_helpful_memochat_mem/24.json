It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B.

Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher.

Maybe you can make it out to one of my games sometime? ### Speaker B: I would love that. Hopefully I can make it this weekend. I have an exam on Friday and then hopefully I can make it there before your game. ### Speaker A: Which exam?  I had a history test last week and it was horrible.  I wish my teacher was better, or at least made the topic interesting.  It's so boring in his class that I have a hard time paying attention. ### Speaker B: It is for my sport medicine. It is the last one of the class I have made A's all year so hopefully I can pass this one also and I'll be done. ### Speaker A: Oh nice!  I wish that I could get all A's.  I'm more of a B and occasional C student.  The only guaranteed A I have is in gym, haha ### Speaker B: I think everyone gets an A in gym. I have studied really hard to get those As I want to pass with good grades. I figure it would help me get a good job afterwards. ### Speaker A: I'm sure it will.  My sister got good grades in school and ended up with a great teaching job.  I know it's not the same, but it definitely helped her.  I still am hoping that I can get a soccer scholarship, because there's no way that I'll get one for my academics. ### Speaker B: Just keep at it and try your hardest. You never know you might surprise yourself' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? ###Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more helpful because it directly relates to the context of studying and exams, which is the current focus of the dialogue. It acknowledges Speaker A's struggles with history, the importance of good grades, and touches upon Speaker B's dedication to studying. Additionally, it provides context for the encouragement Speaker B gives Speaker A about working hard and not giving up, aligning well with the current dialogue context. MEMORY 1, while relevant in understanding Speaker B's pressure from their mother and school life, does not provide direct, helpful context for answering Speaker A's request for help studying for the English final.\n\nChoice: 2"
