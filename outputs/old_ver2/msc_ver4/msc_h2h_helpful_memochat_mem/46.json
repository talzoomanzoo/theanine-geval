Almond and rice milk are pretty good, but I would also miss regular milk. I am sure in the city it's a lot easier to get special foods like gluten free and dairy free if you need it. What if anything, do you like about living in the city? ### Speaker B: I love how late everything is open. Like you said, there's a wide availability of products, and on a mom schedule, sometimes I need to do my shopping very late. It's mostly just convenient to live in the city, but I appreciate what the country has to offer too. Do you think you'd like a city at all? ### Speaker A: I used to live in a suburb of DC and I liked some things. I agree, I miss stores and restaurants being open all night. In the small town in the country, there is not much in the way of culture and I miss that. Everything closes on Sunday and town is done at maybe 8pm.  ### Speaker B: Yeah, once you have convenience it's hard to go back. When I go visit my friends in the country we can't even use food delivery services most of the time. I think there are ups and downs to both. Maybe one day I'll hit the lotto and be able to have a city and a country house. ### Speaker A: That would be ideal, to have a city and country house, or a summer and winter home and maybe do Airbnb part of the year. Yeah, we don't even have Uber or Lyft here. The biggest store is Walmart. We can dream about hitting the lotto, yes. That would be awesome. I would buy a bunch of sound equipment and play blues music.  ### Speaker B: That would be amazing! I know that equipment can be SO expensive. But yeah, no ride shares, no Grubhub or Door Dash. But there's a lot more peace and quiet I'll bet. ### Speaker A: Yes, there are pros and cons to country life. We eat really well with fresh produce and get a lot of fresh air. I don't miss the traffic at all. Around DC, it was so bad and it took an hour to go what was a 20 minute trip anywhere else. I love the peace out here. Our town is famous for Silver Queen Sweet Corn. I can travel to the city when I want and live out here though. That's not bad. Would you want to move to a suburb or the country? ### Speaker B: Oh, I think I'd probably like to go full country if I'm going to do it. And I'm ready to not be so close to neighbors' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive. ###Speaker B: Oh I see.
