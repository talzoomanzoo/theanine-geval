When is your next retreat? ### Speaker A: We've gotten some volunteers, but always need more!  Thank you for getting your scout troop involved.  We are having another retreat next month.  It'll be a youth retreat if you and your friends would be interested. ### Speaker B: That sounds like a great idea!

I'll be having to bring the babies along, so I hope they won't fuss too much. ### Speaker B: I'm sure they will be just fine. They are probably going to be little angels. ### Speaker A: I think they can read each other's minds.  It always looks like they are plotting something! haha ### Speaker B: I've heard that twins are connected in ways that most siblings aren't. Something about them sharing a womb and all that.
