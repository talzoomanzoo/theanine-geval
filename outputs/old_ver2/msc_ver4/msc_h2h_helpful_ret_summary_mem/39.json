    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 2 contains more relevant information to address the current question about Speaker B considering taking their snakes to a college dorm. Memory 2 mentions that Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel, and this detail directly aligns with the current dialogue context where Speaker A asks about the snakes. Memory 1 also mentions Hansel and Gretel, but Memory 2 additionally provides Speaker B's interests in animals and marine life, which could give more context around the consideration of taking the snakes to college.\n\nChoice: 2"
