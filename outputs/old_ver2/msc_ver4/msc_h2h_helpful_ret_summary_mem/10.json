    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 both contain useful information about Speaker A working at a restaurant and enjoying their job despite being busy. However, MEMORY 1 contains additional detail about a past fire incident at the restaurant. While the fire incident isn't directly relevant to the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT, MEMORY 1's mention of the free meals may lead to a more informative follow-up to Speaker B's question about free dessert. Therefore, MEMORY 1 is slightly more helpful for providing context about Speaker A's work benefits, which ties into the mention of receiving free meals.\n\nChoice: 1"
