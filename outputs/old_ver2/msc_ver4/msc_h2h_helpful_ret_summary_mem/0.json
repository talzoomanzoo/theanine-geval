Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains information directly about Speaker A having eight grandchildren and Speaker B having a nephew who is turning 14, which aligns with the last utterance by Speaker A asking about Speaker B's nephew. This adds relevant context to the conversation. MEMORY 2, while providing some similar context, does not prominently highlight the relationship information between the speakers and their respective relatives, which would be more helpful for Speaker B's response to Speaker A's question about the nephew.\n\nChoice: 1"
