    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories contain useful background information about Speaker B's involvement with the Boy Scouts, which is relevant to the current discussion about camping and survival skills. However, MEMORY 2 provides slightly more context about Speaker A's church activities and involvement, which could provide additional depth to the conversation, even though it's less directly applicable to the current dialogue. Overall, the relevant Boy Scout details are equally presented.\n\nChoice: tie"
