    "prediction": "Explanation: The helpful MEMORY should reinforce the idea of Co-worker A's growth and progress since past mistakes and how this ties into their current promotion and success in adjusting to the night shift. MEMORY 1 directly highlights Co-worker A's effort to be more aware of their actions, connecting this change to Co-worker B's appreciation and forgiveness regarding the past arrest situation, which provides direct context and expansion to the dialogue regarding Co-worker A's progress. MEMORY 2 also contains relevant information about Co-worker A's promotion and co-workers' past collaborations but is more segmented and less cohesive in presenting the narrative of personal progress and mutual understanding between Co-worker A and B.\n\nChoice: 1"
