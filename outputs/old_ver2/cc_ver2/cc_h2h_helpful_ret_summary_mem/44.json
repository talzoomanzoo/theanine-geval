    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT discusses an unexpected event where Classmates A confesses to cheating on their taxes due to financial struggles. Immediately after, Classmates A brings up their earlier discussed goal of becoming a professional basketball player. For Classmates B to respond appropriately, it's important for them to recall Classmates A's aspirations and the financial struggles tied to their dream, which might provide context for the cheating. \n\nMEMORY 2 is more helpful as it covers not only the aspiration (similar to MEMORY 1) but also contains relevant supportive advice from Classmates B. Additionally, MEMORY 2 includes the financial aspect with the grocery store job, and it acknowledges Classmates A's self-doubts about achieving their basketball dream. This comprehensive information provides Classmates B with context to understand Classmates A's actions (cheating on taxes due to financial struggles) in relation to their basketball aspirations.\n\nChoice: 2"
