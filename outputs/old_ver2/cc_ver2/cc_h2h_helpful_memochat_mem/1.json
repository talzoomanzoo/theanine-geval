    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 mainly focuses on the Mentee's decision-making process regarding taking a job in a new city and the previous incident of stealing shoes, none of which directly address the current issue of loneliness expressed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, emphasizes empathy and the acknowledgment of feeling overwhelmed in a new situation, which is more relevant to the Mentee feeling lonely in a new city. However, both memories largely focus on the Mentee's process of dealing with stress and responsibilities, not directly addressing social connection or loneliness.\n\nChoice: tied"
