I don't want to look weak. ### Neighbors B: Apologizing doesn't make you weak. It actually takes a lot of strength to admit when you're wrong and try to make it right. ### Neighbors A: I guess you're right. I just wish I didn't have to do it. ### Neighbors B: What happened? Do you want to talk about it? ### Neighbors A: I said something really insensitive to a coworker and I didn't realize how hurtful it was until they called me out on it. ### Neighbors B: That's tough. But it's good that they brought it to your attention so you can make it right. ### Neighbors A: Yeah, I know. I just don't know the best way to apologize. ### Neighbors B: Well, first you need to truly acknowledge what you did wrong and how it affected the other person. And then you can apologize and try to make it better. ### Neighbors A: That's a good point. Maybe I'll write them a letter or something. ### Neighbors B: That's a great idea. And if you need any help with it, feel free to ask me.
