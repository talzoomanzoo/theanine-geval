    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides a positive context for Co-worker A's progress, reflecting Co-worker B's past appreciation of Co-worker A's change in behavior. This aligns with the notion that Co-worker A is doing well in their new role and is more responsible, which is the focus of Co-worker A's new revelation about their promotion. MEMORY 2, while relevant, mostly revisits past actions where Co-worker A was irresponsible, which is less helpful for responding to Co-worker A's current positive statement about improvement.\n\nChoice: 1"
