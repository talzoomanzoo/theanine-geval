What happened? ### Parent: Well, I got into some trouble with the law. I feel scared and upset right now. ### Child: I'm sorry to hear that. Do you know how long you will have to stay there? ### Parent: Not yet. That's something I'm trying to figure out. ### Child: Is there anything I can do to help? ### Parent: Just knowing that you're thinking of me and supporting me means a lot. Thank you. ### Child: Of course, Dad. I love you. ### Parent: I love you too, kiddo. And I'm sorry for any pain that my actions may have caused you. ### Child: It's okay, Dad. Everyone makes mistakes. We'll get through this together. ### Parent: That means a lot to me, son. Thank you. ### Parent: I remember waking up early one morning while I was in juvenile detention. I couldn't see the sunrise from my cell, but I still felt hopeful that things would get better. ### Child: That must have been tough, not having the freedom to just go outside and watch the sunrise. ### Parent: It was. But I learned to appreciate the small moments and find hope even in the darkest of situations. ### Child: That's really inspiring, Parent. Did you ever get to see the sunrise when you got out of detention? ### Parent: I did. One morning, I woke up early and went outside to watch the sunrise. It was a reminder to me that there is always a new day and a chance to start fresh. ### Child: That's so beautiful.
