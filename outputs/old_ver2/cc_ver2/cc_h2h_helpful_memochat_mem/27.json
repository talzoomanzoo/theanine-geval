    "prediction": "Explanation: Both MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 touch on the fact that Co-worker A took over the family business and learned valuable skills through that experience. However, MEMORY 1 specifically highlights efficiency and proactiveness, which is directly relevant to Co-worker A's mention of what they learned and applied in their report preparation. MEMORY 2 provides more expanded context on success, trust, and maintaining legacy, which is relevant but less directly focused on the efficiency aspect discussed in the recent interaction.\n\nChoice: 1"
