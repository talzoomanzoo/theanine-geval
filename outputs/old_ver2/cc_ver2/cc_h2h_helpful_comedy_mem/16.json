MEMORY 1 directly aligns with the dialogue context with its focus on Co-worker A's fantasies and previous stress about their relationship with Co-worker B, which directly relates to Co-worker A's mentioned stress in the dialogue. MEMORY 2 reiterates information about Co-worker A's growth and increased confidence and offers broader context, but doesn't add much to the specific topic of Co-worker A's relationship concerns or their past visions of leadership as directly as MEMORY 1 does.\n\nChoice: 1"
