    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 directly addresses Classmates A's curiosity and risk-taking nature, which is valuable context for understanding why Classmates A might be inquiring about their past and potential secrets. It includes specific interactions (e.g., the mysterious woman in the alley) that reflect this curiosity, which can help Classmates B understand Classmates A's mindset in the current conversation. In contrast, MEMORY 1 merges various points, some less relevant to the question about the past, making it less focused.\n\nChoice: 2"
