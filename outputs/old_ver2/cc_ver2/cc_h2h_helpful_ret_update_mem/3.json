PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is not helpful in that context.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nCo-worker A witnessed a fight and intervened to separate the two women.\nCo-worker B commended Co-worker A for their bravery and willingness to help.\nCo-worker A spoke with the police about the incident and the women involved were thankful.\nCo-worker B mentioned helping a customer resolve an issue last week, showing a willingness to assist others.\nCo-worker A was in a car accident and lost their hands and feet.\nCo-worker A is alive but will need time to adjust to their new way of life.\nCo-worker B is supportive and willing to help in any way.\nCo-worker A will need all the help they can get during their recovery.\nCo-worker A is trying to stay positive and focus on their recovery, despite it being a daunting task.\nCo-worker A is remembered for being brave and strong in past situations.\nCo-worker A has a positive attitude and focuses on making people happy despite facing challenges like losing their hands and feet.\nCo-worker B admires Co-worker A's resilience and positivity.\nCo-worker A believes in surrounding oneself with positive energy and uplifting people.\nCo-worker A intervened to help two women who were fighting, showing bravery and a desire to make a positive impact.\nCo-worker A is humble and tries to make the world a better place by helping others.\nCo-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\nCo-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\nCo-worker A is described as positive and able to stay optimistic even in challenging situations, like the accident where they lost their hands and feet.\nCo-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's positivity and friendship.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nCo-worker B showed a willingness to assist others by helping a customer resolve an issue last week. This demonstrates Co-worker B's supportive nature and readiness to help in any way.

Co-worker A intervened to help two women who were fighting, showing bravery and a desire to make a positive impact.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains relevant information about the interaction where Co-worker A borrowed a pencil, felt guilty about it, and related this action to the idea of \"stealing\" the bride, which Co-worker B responded to understandingly. It also highlights Co-worker B's supportive nature and acknowledgment of Co-worker A's resilience and positivity, reinforcing the important relational dynamic of understanding and support. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 presents a broader yet more disjointed overview of Co-worker A and B's past interactions and achievements, such as bravery and needing time to adjust after losing limbs, which are not directly related to the current dialogue around the misguided and unethical plan Co-worker A is discussing. Overall, MEMORY 1 is more focused on aspects of the relationship and interactions that are directly useful and relevant for Co-worker B's response to the current context.\n\nChoice: 1"
