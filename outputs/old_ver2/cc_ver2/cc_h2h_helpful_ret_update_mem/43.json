    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is centered on Neighbor A dealing with feelings of inadequacy after a breakup. Neighbor B is providing support and offering to go for a walk to help Neighbor A cope. In this context, the most helpful memory should include information about the emotional support between Neighbors A and B, the coping mechanisms related to nature, and activities that can take Neighbor A's mind off their troubles. \n\nBoth Memory 1 and Memory 2 include relevant information, such as Neighbor B offering support during a difficult time, Neighbor A's solace in nature, and their enjoyment of walks together, which aligns with Neighbor B's suggestion in the dialogue context. Memory 1 additionally mentions that Neighbor A appreciates emotional support and that they enjoy eating together after activities, which might offer more depth to Neighbor B's support. Memory 2 highlights the grief from the loss of a grandmother, adding an additional emotional layer that may not be directly related to the current issue of a breakup but still contributes to the context of needing support.\n\nChoice: tie"
