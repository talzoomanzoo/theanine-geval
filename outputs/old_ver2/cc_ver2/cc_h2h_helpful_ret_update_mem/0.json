    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context revolves around the importance of listening during tough times, with the child asking the parent if they felt unheard while in detention. MEMORY 2 provides context about the parent's tough experience with the justice system and their reliance on others, highlighting the relevance of feeling unheard or needing support. This memory aligns directly with the child's question. MEMORY 1 focuses more on future plans and expressing support without addressing the specific issue of feeling unheard.\n\nChoice: 2"
