    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about a confrontation regarding an alleged affair, with tensions and accusations present. MEMORY 1 focuses mainly on Classmates A's passion for science and admiration for Classmates B's intelligence, a relevant factor but not as broad in scope given the current conflict. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, provides more comprehensive details about their relationship and their shared interests, which could help diffuse the confrontation by acknowledging the depth of their friendship and past positive interactions. Thus, MEMORY 2 is more useful for a context-driven response that acknowledges the broader relationship beyond the immediate conflict.\n\nChoice: 2"
