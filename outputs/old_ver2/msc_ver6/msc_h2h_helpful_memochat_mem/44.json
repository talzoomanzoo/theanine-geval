I'm going to start sending you a motivational quote every morning at 4 am when I want you to wake up. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B has run a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding. This experience led Speaker A to seek advice on how to recover from marathon training. Speaker A then invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and planning to meet at the beach at 0600. Speaker B got into motivational speaking because they needed it themselves to battle depression and anxiety, which was suggested by Speaker A to combine with something more active to avoid dwelling on negative thoughts. Speaker B, who travels frequently for work and misses their wife and kids, also finds solace in fishing and the outdoors, similar to their background in San Francisco.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Motivational Speaking', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker B shares about being a motivational speaker and how it helps them overcome personal struggles.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: I'm a motivational speaker!

    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories provide context relevant to Speaker B being a motivational speaker and preparing for the Alps marathon with Speaker A. Memory 1 includes additional personal details about Speaker B's personal life and experiences, such as missing their family and enjoying fishing. However, these details are not directly relevant to the current dialogue or the immediate steps Speaker B is taking to support Speaker A with marathon training. On the other hand, Memory 2 focuses more on the core motivation themes and how Speaker B's experiences with depression and anxiety led to their role, aligning well with the dialogue context where Speaker B is about to motivate Speaker A with quotes for the marathon.\n\nChoice: 2"
