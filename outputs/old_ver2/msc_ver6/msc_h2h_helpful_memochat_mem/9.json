My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do.\nSpeaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars.\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I think they go dark for a couple months and then have daylight for a couple months! I actually like night time, but having daylight all the time will make me crazy lol. Yeah I kind of hope it's dark for the camping but it will be very cold. I have heard Alaska has delicious ice cream. I want to try that while I'm there, \nSpeaker A: You'd have to get some serious blackout curtains for when it was daylight lol! You'll have to stock up on some warm essentials before heading out. You definitely don't want to get stuck in a bad situation in the cold, especially if you're alone. I bet they have great ice cream! You'll have to tell me about it when you get back!\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I need to call my friend and find out what season they are in so I can pack accordingly. I will take pictures of the ice cream too so I can tell you about it. I wonder if there are a lot of bears there? I don't like bears either.\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty sure they have grizzlies up there. You better pack something to fend them off too just in case. I bet your friend knows everything you'd need to keep them away.\nSpeaker B: I will bring whatever they let me bring on the airplane, but I am really counting on my friend to help me out with the local customs lol. Do you know if Rocky and Bullwinkle were from Alaska? \nSpeaker A: No, they were from Minnesota. Are you going to have your friend be your hiking guide?\nSpeaker B: I invited my friend to come stay at the lodge where I'm vacationing and he said it would be fun to get away for a bit. So I'm hoping he will show me around for a week or so. I might have to hire a hiking guide, it depends on how much he knows about hiking and grizzlies I think. What do you think?

I'll keep working on a teleport machine. For now, you'll have to get there with more traditional means. So, airplane it is? Have you ever been on a flight before. ### Speaker B: I have been on it a couple times.  My mother said it was powered by pixie dust and I believed her for the longest time!  I am not too scared to go this time.  Have you invented any flying things? ### Speaker A: Squirrels! When I was a kid bouncing on a trampoline, a squirrel jumped down from the tree it was on and landed on the trampoline. Due to my super energetic jumping, he flew for a moment! I guess that's not really an \"invention\" though. Do you ever invent things with your programming experience? ### Speaker B: LOL!  You had me going there for a minute.  I could just see that sucker flying in my mind.  \"Hey Bullwinkle, where's Rocky....\"  LOL  Good one!  I am really good at coding and automating systems, but I haven't really made my own thing. ### Speaker A: I see. I forgot about Rocky and Bullwinkle. That used to be my favorite cartoon. I even watched the live action movies. Thanks for the throwback! I think you just teleported me to my childhood bedroom. I appreciate the free ride down memory lane! I wish I could pay you back with a free plane ticket. ### Speaker B: It's ok!  You gave me the biggest laugh today so I think we are even!  Not to say a free plane ticket wouldn't be nice, but you might just set me on a trampoline and send me flying too! ### Speaker A: That I can do! I'm not sure the squirrel would recommend that method of transportation though, but as long as you sign some liability paperwork before hand, I am good to go! ### Speaker B: Wheeee!  I'm just being so silly now.  Who needs a therapist when we can keep each other so happy? ### Speaker A: What is on your itinerary for your Alaskan vacation? ### Speaker B: Oh, I haven't really looked into that much yet, I guess I should get on that!  Any suggestions?   ### Speaker A: There is so many fun things to do if you enjoy the outdoors! I have heard the fishing and hiking is second to none in Alaska.  ### Speaker B: I'm not big on fishing, but I bet the hiking would be beautiful!  ### Speaker A: I am sure you could even get a hiking tour guide. May help you stay safe from bears or other dangers there. I love a good hike but am often concerned about the bigger animals around.  ### Speaker B: I would definitely go with a tour guide!  I'm not trying to get eaten ha I think it would be cool to see a moose though.   ### Speaker A: Good to hear, that way I know you will be safe! I would love to see a moose in person. I have heard they are larger than you would expect.  ### Speaker B: I can imagine!  I think the biggest animal I've really seen around here in person would be deer or turkey.  Not too exciting ### Speaker A: Well I am excited for this adventure for you! Are you traveling alone or are you going with friends or family? ### Speaker B: I'm traveling alone, but I'm planning on trying to meet up with a friend who lives up there for visit if our schedules work out. ### Speaker A: That would great! I am impressed, I am nervous to travel alone. I prefer having someone around I know when I am on new adventures.  ### Speaker B: I don't mind it.  And sometimes when you want to go somewhere, you just want to go, and it's hard to coordinate with others.  I'm always up for a traveling pal though ### Speaker A: Have you made plans with your friend to get together when you get to Alaska? Does your friend enjoy action movies too?  ### Speaker B: we are working on plans currently. trying to get our schedules lined up. I'm not sure if they like action movies or not.  ### Speaker A: two weeks of the great alaska. have you decided how you spend your time outdoors. ### Speaker B: lots of hiking and trying not to get eaten by mosquitoes. lol ### Speaker A: what else is alaska known for? what can visitors expect besides hiking? ### Speaker B: i'm not sure honestly. I'll have to ask my friend what else there is to do. lol' }(2) {'Related Topics': 'Alaska Impressions and Exploration', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B exchange thoughts on Alaska's climate, activities, and landscapes.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: my impression of alaska are the beautiful pics I have seen.
