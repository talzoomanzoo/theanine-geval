I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field?\nSpeaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate?\nSpeaker B: I have another year- so this year is really important I get internships and start making connections in the field.   I love going to the beach too.  What happened with your knees that now cause you so much pain? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A mentioning their neighbor John, who loves soccer, leads Speaker B to study sports medicine, play soccer, and aim to join their college team. This interest causes Speaker B to seek internships in sports medicine and enjoy surfing instead. Speaker B's professors being supportive in writing letters for an internship application causes Speaker A to offer advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field. Speaker B, as a college student playing soccer with peers, transitions to looking for internships in sports medicine, asking professors for letters of recommendation. This change results in Speaker B struggling to find internships and feeling disadvantaged compared to those with connections.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Networking and Connections', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A suggests networking opportunities and connections for Speaker B's goals.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: I'll definitely let him know about you.

I really want to make the team so I need all the help I can get! ### Speaker A: Sounds good. Have your professors been pretty receptive to writing letter for you? ### Speaker B: For the internship? Yeah they've been great. I'm really lucky I've got cool profs this year. ### Speaker A: How's the internship hunt going? ### Speaker B: It's tough right now to be honest. Not enough internships for too many students. ### Speaker A: I am sorry to hear that. The job market should pick up soon. The good thing about being in the medical field is that there is always a need for more help! ### Speaker B: Sports medicine is so popular right now. All the young sports fans grown up I guess.  ### Speaker A: Well, keep confidence in yourself that you are the best of the best and will outshine the competition! ### Speaker B: I hope so. Everyone else has all these connections through family and stuff. Their dad knows someone, etc. Gotta beat that. ### Speaker A: Keep up the surfing and maybe you will make some connections that way. ### Speaker B: That's true. I've heard that a lot of doctors surf on breaks to get their minds clear.
