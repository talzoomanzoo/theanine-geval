    "prediction": "Explanation: \nMEMORY 1 provides background information about Speaker A's and Speaker B's interests in neuroscience and pet snakes, as well as their involvement in scuba diving, which might help Speaker B respond with how the snakes might fit into a college dorm context. MEMORY 2, while mentioning pet snakes and scuba diving, doesn't offer any specific information related to what Speaker B might do with the snakes when they go to college. MEMORY 1 provides information about Speaker A's college planning, making it more relevant to the question of taking the snakes to a college dorm.\n\nChoice: 1"
