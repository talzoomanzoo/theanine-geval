    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 focuses more on the zoo visit specifics, highlighting Speaker A's frequent zoo visits and interests, as well as Speaker B's interest in finding family discounts, which aligns with the current context about visiting a zoo and specific animals named Joshua. It offers useful information regarding the shared interest in zoos, animals, and previous zoo visits, which can be further explored. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, although it mentions their shared interest in animals and the zoo, diverges into unrelated backgrounds such as working in metal factories and moving out from a spouse, which isn't directly helpful in the current context.\n\nChoice: 1"
