    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides more detailed and relevant information regarding Speaker B's preferences, lifestyle, and dreams, which are consistent with the previous dialogue's context where both speakers discuss their desire for a city and country house. This MEMORY aligns well with the conversation about winning the lottery and buying a dream house, making it more helpful for contextual response. MEMORY 1 contains some relevant details but focuses more on Speaker B's family and strategies for playing the lotto, which are less directly related to the current dialogue's focus on lifestyle preferences and dreams of dual living.\n\nChoice: 2"
