    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 both contain information about Speaker A's connection to jello and family traditions related to it. However, MEMORY 2 also contains details about Speaker B's current interest in cooking and baking, as well as their excitement to join Speaker A's family for water skiing, which aligns well with the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B talks about learning to bake and waiting to go skiing with Speaker A's family. Therefore, MEMORY 2 provides more helpful and relevant context to respond appropriately.\n\nChoice: 2"
