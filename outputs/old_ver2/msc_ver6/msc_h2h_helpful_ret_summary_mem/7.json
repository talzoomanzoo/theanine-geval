    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain helpful and detailed information, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\nNOTE:\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is to be regarded as an unhelpful memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker B has a lot of kids, all grown up now and with kids of their own.\nSpeaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\nSpeaker B mentions having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own.\nSpeaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\nSpeaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\nSpeaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\nSpeaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call!\nSpeaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip?  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A is a librarian and loves kids, mentioning having 3 children. This makes Speaker A busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. Consequently, Speaker B, who has a lot of kids all grown up with kids of their own, enjoys spending time with their grandkids at the park. This led Speaker B to take their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n2. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n3. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n4. Speaker B has grandkids who are more interested in phones and tablets than musical instruments.\n5. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n6. Speaker B mentions having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories contain information regarding Speaker A's busy work life and Speaker B's family dynamics, specifically regarding grandkids and fishing trips. MEMORY 1 provides detailed context about Speaker A's profession (librarian) and their number of children, while MEMORY 2 includes additional specific information about the grandkids' interest in phones and tablets. The mention of technology in MEMORY 2 directly relates to the current discussion in the dialogue. However, MEMORY 2 also adds redundant and less relevant points (points 5 and 6), which don't contribute much to the context needed for Speaker A's response.\n\nChoice: tie"
