One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha!\nSpeaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes?\nSpeaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe. \nSpeaker A: You make them sounds so fascinating. Will you take them with you to your college dorm?  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B recently divorced their wife and loves to scuba dive in Hawaii when not working. Speaker A is scared of sharks but finds the idea of going into a steel cage with them interesting. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n\nSpeaker B recently divorced their wife and loves to scuba dive in Hawaii when not working.
