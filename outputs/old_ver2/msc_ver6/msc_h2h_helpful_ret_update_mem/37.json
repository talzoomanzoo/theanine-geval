Did you find the book sufficiently exciting? \nSpeaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far.\nSpeaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes. \nSpeaker A: why don't you like books like that?\nSpeaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B's fascination with animals allows them to understand Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals. This is because Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves with technology or watching TV. Additionally, Speaker A enjoys watching movies with their grandchildren. Speaker B, on the other hand, has a young son and finds solace in reading books, especially those about animals. This interest in animals is shared with Speaker A, who mentions watching movies with their grandchildren.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B is fascinated by animals and can relate to Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals.\n2. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n3. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n4. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n5. Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves by using technology or watching TV.\n6. Speaker A was influenced by Alex Trebek and Ken Jennings to develop a love for books and reading.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 is more helpful because it provides a more direct and relatable context by emphasizing Speaker B's fascination with animals and their interest in animal-related books. It gives insight into Speaker B's preference, which is relevant to the current dialogue where Speaker B mentions their interest in animal books over crime fiction. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, includes a wider range of information, but not all of it directly pertains to the current conversation about book genres and animal books. The influence of Alex Trebek and Ken Jennings mentioned in MEMORY 2 is unrelated to this specific context.\n\nChoice: 1"
