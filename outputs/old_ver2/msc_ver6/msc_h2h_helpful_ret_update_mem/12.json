Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science, and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics. \nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities. \nSpeaker B majoring in linguistics causes Speaker A to be interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n3. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n4. Speaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\n5. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n6. Speaker A is involved with a football league and is looking forward to playing games.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides information about Speaker A's interest in teaching computer science and robotics, which is relevant to the current conversation where Speaker A expresses a desire to teach robotics. It also aligns with Speaker A's current situation of working to pay for college and studying computer science. Moreover, it offers insight into Speaker B's academic considerations, which can be useful in understanding their perspective in the dialogue. MEMORY 2 provides a broader range of information, but the details regarding volunteering and football are not directly relevant to addressing Speaker B's current expression of uncertainty and career decisions in the dialogue. Therefore, MEMORY 1 is more directly helpful to the current dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 1"
