Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\nSpeaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing?  \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker A mentions having eight grandchildren and already having blue hair. Speaker B has an oldest nephew who is about to turn 14.\n2. Both Speaker A's mother and Speaker A were librarians, but Speaker A is retired. Speaker B asks if the recommended book is fiction or nonfiction.\n3.

Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\n6. Speaker B has an oldest nephew who is about to turn 14.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories include details about the relationship between Speaker A and B, highlight the fact that Speaker A is retired, and that Speaker A has eight grandchildren. Both also mention Speaker B's oldest nephew who is about to turn 14. However, MEMORY 1 is more directly relevant because it mentions Speaker A's grandchildren and their interest in hair care, which connects better with Speaker A asking about Speaker B's nephew, potentially suggesting a reciprocal interest in their family members' lives. Additionally, MEMORY 1 does not mention Speaker B's upcoming trip, which is already well covered in the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT, reducing redundancy.\n\nChoice: 1"
