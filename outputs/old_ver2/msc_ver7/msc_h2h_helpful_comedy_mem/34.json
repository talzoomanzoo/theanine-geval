    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides information about Speaker A and Speaker B's shared interest in visiting the zoo, which directly aligns with the current dialogue context of discussing the San Diego Zoo. It mentions Speaker A's preference for cockatoos over kittens and references Speaker A's sister's recent marriage, which is consistent with the previous dialogue.

Therefore, MEMORY 1 is more helpful in providing supportive context for Speaker A's next response.\n\nChoice: 1"
