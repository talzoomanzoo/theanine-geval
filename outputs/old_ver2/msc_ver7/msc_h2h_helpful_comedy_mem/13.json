    "prediction": "Explanation: The current dialogue is primarily about camping experiences and also includes a reference to the zoo, specifically mentioning \"Joshua,\" the tiger, which Speaker A enjoys seeing. Both MEMORIES provide context related to the zoo, but MEMORY 1 focuses more on Speaker A's frequent visits to the zoo and their interest in tigers, which directly connects to the mention of Joshua in the dialogue. MEMORY 2, while it also mentions the zoo and Joshua, includes additional information about Speaker B's personal life that is not directly relevant to the current conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
