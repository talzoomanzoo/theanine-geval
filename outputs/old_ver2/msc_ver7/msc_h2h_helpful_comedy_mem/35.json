    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - Helpfulness refers to which MEMORY provides relevant and supportive context to the Speaker A’s next response based on the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The better memory would enhance the Speaker A’s ability to respond accurately and in context.\n\nNOTE:\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is to be regarded as an unhelpful memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker A loves the show Friends and enjoys visiting graffiti-filled places.\nSpeaker A and Speaker B have a conversation about their personal interests and trips they have taken for work.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons\nSpeaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use.\nSpeaker B: I am a little scared of needles though. Were your tattoos painful?\nSpeaker A: Most of them were not.  It really depends on where on your body you get them.  Most of mine are on areas that didn't hurt.  The one on my foot and the one behind my ear did hurt a good bit.  Where were you thinking about getting it?\nSpeaker B: I hadn't really thought about it! Maybe upper arm or upper back? But I'm no tattoo expert. And I'd have to get permission from my wife first, LOL\nSpeaker A: Definitely talk to her first.  I had a friend that didn't talk to his wife and just came home with a tattoo one day.  It led to a huge fight - both about the money he spent and not discussing it with her.  He slept on my couch for over a week!\nSpeaker B: Oh no! Yeah, you don't want to spring something like that on your spouse. I don't think you mentioned before, are you married?\nSpeaker A: No.  I haven't found anyone that could deal with me or that I could deal with for more than a few months.  At this point, I have given up on the idea of getting married and want to focus on my artwork.\nSpeaker B: There's nothing wrong with being on your own. You've got to focus on meeting your own needs first. Have you done any interesting art/graffiti lately? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A works at a coffee shop that their mom owned, which is why they plan to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\nSpeaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father, and is saving up for their next tattoo at the coffee shop.\nSpeaker A's favorite tattoo is the one dedicated to their late father, saying \"for you I shall live\", and they plan to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description: Speaker B is an avid fisherman who enjoys traveling for work. His favorite food is fries, and he recently went fishing for a 30-pound muskie in Michigan during a sales convention. Speaker B's family also enjoys fishing, and his wife was shocked when shown a picture of the fish he caught.\n\nRelationship Description: Speaker B and the robot, Speaker A, have a friendly and engaging relationship, discussing fishing trips and sharing recommendations for places to visit and activities to do.\n\nEvent Description: Speaker B and Speaker A are planning fishing trips off the California coast, specifically mentioning locations like Humboldt County, Eureka, Arcata, and the redwood forest. Speaker A warns about car burglaries in the area, and Speaker B acknowledges the risk. They also discuss visiting Fort Humboldt State Park, Sequoia Park Forest and Garden, and Carson Mansion. Speaker B's goal is to visit every national park in the US, showing a shared interest in outdoor activities and exploration. Speaker A is working hard to save up for a tattoo of their father's face next to a slogan, planning to get it at the same place.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 is more helpful in this context because it provides detailed information about Speaker A's interest and plans regarding tattoos, which directly relates to the ongoing conversation about tattoos and could enrich Speaker A's response. The details about Speaker A's tattoos, particularly the one dedicated to their father, and their plans for another tattoo are pertinent to the discussion. MEMORY 2, although providing information about Speaker B's interests, does not offer relevant context in this conversation about tattoos.\n\nChoice: 1"
