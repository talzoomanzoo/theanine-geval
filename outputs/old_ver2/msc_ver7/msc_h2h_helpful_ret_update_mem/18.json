Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with.\nSpeaker A: Sounds great! Now the tough question: when do you have time? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket but now plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.
