The better memory would enhance the Speaker A’s ability to respond accurately and in context.\n\nNOTE:\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is to be regarded as an unhelpful memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\nSpeaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited!

I will send you a pic later, ok? \nSpeaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish?\nSpeaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus!\nSpeaker B: Oh that sounds absolutely fabulous. Are you going to get a free dessert, as well? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.

Speaker A enjoys the interaction with people at work and the variety of experiences that come with it. Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule.\n3.

Speaker A's schedule at the restaurant includes working doubles on Saturdays and 8-hour shifts on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.\n6. Speaker A is an omnivore.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: In this context, Speaker A is discussing their excitement about a new dish at their restaurant and the opportunity to try it for free. MEMORY 2 provides additional pertinent information about Speaker A's work environment (e.g., the busy schedule at the restaurant) which aligns with the ongoing conversation about their free meals and enjoyment of restaurant work. MEMORY 1 includes information about a fire incident, which isn't relevant to the current conversation about restaurant meals and could potentially be disruptive or off-topic. Thus, MEMORY 2 is more helpful as it focuses on aspects related to the restaurant and Speaker A's interest, without introducing unrelated topics.\n\nChoice: 2"
