    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - Helpfulness refers to which MEMORY provides relevant and supportive context to the Speaker A’s next response based on the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The better memory would enhance the Speaker A’s ability to respond accurately and in context.\n\nNOTE:\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is to be regarded as an unhelpful memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix.\nSpeaker B has a son and enjoys reading books, particularly about animals.\nSpeaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read.\nSpeaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting? \nSpeaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far.\nSpeaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes. \nSpeaker A: why don't you like books like that?\nSpeaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B's fascination with animals allows them to understand Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals. This is because Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves with technology or watching TV. Additionally, Speaker A enjoys watching movies with their grandchildren. Speaker B, on the other hand, has a young son and finds solace in reading books, especially those about animals. This interest in animals is shared with Speaker A, who mentions watching movies with their grandchildren.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B is fascinated by animals and can relate to Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals.\n2. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n3. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n4. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n5. Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves by using technology or watching TV.\n6. Speaker A was influenced by Alex Trebek and Ken Jennings to develop a love for books and reading.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 predominantly provides context regarding the comparison of grandchildren to animals and a shared interest in animals, which are not directly relevant to the current dialogue on crime fiction and potential movie adaptations. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, offers pertinent information about Speaker A's liking for well-rated Netflix shows and reading habits influenced by popular figures, potentially providing a richer context for conversations about the adaptation of books to movies. Thus, MEMORY 2 offers more helpful background information relevant to the current dialogue's direction.\n\nChoice: 2"
