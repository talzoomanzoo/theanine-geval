This desire to visit Sweden is leading Speaker A to consider saving money by taking on a second part-time job. Additionally, Speaker B, who is from Sweden, suggested checking out the volcanoes in the country for a unique experience.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a comprehensive context that aligns well with the current dialogue. It mentions both Speakers' plans to travel together, the need for saving money, and Speaker B’s experience and sentiment towards Sweden, which could help Speaker B provide more personalized recommendations and insights. In contrast, MEMORY 1 focuses more on the volcanic suggestion and Speaker B's origin, which has already been mentioned and doesn't add new supportive information relevant to the current planning stage of Speaker A's trip.\n\nChoice: 2"
