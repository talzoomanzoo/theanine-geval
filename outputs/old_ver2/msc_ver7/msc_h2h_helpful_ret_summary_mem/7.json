    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - Helpfulness refers to which MEMORY provides relevant and supportive context to the Speaker A’s next response based on the CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The better memory would enhance the Speaker A’s ability to respond accurately and in context.\n\nNOTE:\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is to be regarded as an unhelpful memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker B has a lot of kids, all grown up now and with kids of their own.\nSpeaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\nSpeaker B mentions having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own.\nSpeaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\nSpeaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\nSpeaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\nSpeaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call!\nSpeaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip?  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A is a librarian and loves kids, mentioning having 3 children. This makes Speaker A busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. Consequently, Speaker B, who has a lot of kids all grown up with kids of their own, enjoys spending time with their grandkids at the park. This led Speaker B to take their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n2. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n3. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n4. Speaker B has grandkids who are more interested in phones and tablets than musical instruments.\n5. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n6. Speaker B mentions having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 both provide relevant context about Speaker B wanting to initiate an annual fishing trip tradition for their grandkids, and about Speaker A's busy schedule. Additionally, MEMORY 2 provides a specific and potentially useful detail that Speaker B's grandkids are more interested in phones and tablets, which could connect to the current dialogue about the use of technology to interact with grandkids. While MEMORY 1 offers a concise description, MEMORY 2 provides a slightly broader context that could be more helpful for crafting a nuanced response in the ongoing conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
