    "prediction": "Explanation: The CURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses on Speaker A's excitement about a new dish on the menu at their workplace and the possibility of getting a free dessert. MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 both provide context about free meals and work schedule, but MEMORY 2 provides more details, such as Speaker B's preferences for Mediterranean food, which could allow Speaker A to make a more engaged and relevant response. However, the memories related to the restaurant and visiting detail are repetitive in both MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2.\n\nChoice: 2"
