The better memory would enhance the Speaker A’s ability to respond accurately and in context.\n\nNOTE:\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY is a summary of the previous dialog, and If the MEMORY contains information that conflicts with the PREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY, it is to be regarded as an unhelpful memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nPREVIOUS DIALOGUE SUMMARY:\nSpeaker B recently quit their job at Cisco to pursue snowboarding.\nSpeaker A loves boating and water sports, mentioning that they are better at water skiing than wakeboarding.\nSpeaker B expresses interest in trying water skiing next.\nSpeaker A has been water skiing for 15 years and has 3 kids who also water ski.\nSpeaker B is excited to join Speaker A's family for a water skiing trip and wants to learn from Speaker A's kids.\n\nCURRENT DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on!\nSpeaker B: Family traditions are important.

This causes Speaker A to have a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes. Speaker A learned how to make jello from their grandma, turning it into a family tradition. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Family traditions and recipes', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A talks about learning jello recipes from their grandma and how it has become a family tradition.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: Right! It's so good! I'm not a very good cook but I do know how to make jello! ### Speaker B: Well that's a good start I guess! Did you grandma teach you how to make it? ### Speaker A: Yeah she did teach me! It's become a family tradition! ### Speaker B: That's so sweet! I wish I had the opportunity to spend that kind of quality time with my grandparents. ### Speaker A: It is very nice! Why don't you have the time? ### Speaker B: They were always pretty busy running their grocery store and I never really got much of a chance to spend that kind of time with them before they died, unfortunately. ### Speaker A: My grandma just taught me an even better cherry jello recipe than the one she taught me before.  ### Speaker B: Nice! How did it turn out? ### Speaker A: Not too bad but still needs some work! ### Speaker B: I am sure the more you make it the better it will get. Has your grandma taught you to make anything else? ### Speaker A: She's taught me how to make all kinds of recipes but all of them are with jello.  So I may need to find a different teacher to learn some new recipes! Do you like to bake? ### Speaker B: No I don't do a lot of cooking or baking, I do want to learn though but I don't have anyone to teach me. ### Speaker A: Well my grandma would be happy to get you started on the jello recipes, haha!

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides a personal connection for Speaker A to jello and their grandmother, which resonates with the current topic of continuing family traditions such as making jello, which Speaker B is also discussing. It allows Speaker A to relate on a more personal level with Speaker B, who has been sharing about teaching jello recipes to their children. This alignment with the topic of family traditions—specifically jello recipes—will help Speaker A respond meaningfully.\n\nMEMORY 2 also relates to jello recipes and family traditions; however, it contains less specific personal information about Speaker A's experiences with jello compared to MEMORY 1. It is a broader overview of a similar topic but doesn't uniquely position Speaker A to relate through their own experience as strongly as MEMORY 1.\n\nChoice: 1"
