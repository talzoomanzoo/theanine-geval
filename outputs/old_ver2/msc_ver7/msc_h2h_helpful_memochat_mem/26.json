Is it similar to a pressure cooker? ### Speaker A: No, a tandoor is a special type of oven which they use in India to make tandoori chicken. It helps give it its flavour. It is made from clay. ### Speaker B: Oh I see! I've never used a pressure cooker before. Does it cook other things other than lentils? I hear it makes the cooking go much faster. ### Speaker A: Yes, you can do lots of things in pressure cookers like stews and soups. Most of the time, I use it to soften meat. I love putting my lamb shanks in there. It makes the meat fall right off the bone. Do you have a pressure cooker? ### Speaker B: I don't, but hearing what you're saying makes me want to purchase one for my husband. He's an avid cook but sometimes that makes the cooking process a lot longer than I want! ### Speaker A: I would recommend a pressure cooker. It is a great item for beginner cooks. You throw it all in, pop the lid on and wait for the whistle really.

    "prediction": "Explanation: \nMemory 1 provides context about Speaker B's rural living and farming lifestyle, mentioning that they have chickens, which aligns with Speaker B's interest in using their own eggs for cooking. This connection can help Speaker A affirm the suggestion of the shrimp fried rice recipe or make an alternative recommendation that includes eggs. On the other hand, Memory 2 focuses more on the pressure cooker and its advantages, which is less directly related to the specific question Speaker B is asking about the inclusion of eggs in the recipe. \n\nChoice: 1"
