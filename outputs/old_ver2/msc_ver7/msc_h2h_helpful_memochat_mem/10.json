The only similarity will be the screaming girls in the audience.lol ### Speaker B: Hehe… true! By the way do you get to eat for free at the restaurant you work at? ### Speaker A: We get two free meals per week and we can take home any left over baked goods at the end of the night so they don't go to waste.  It's a nice perk for sure. ### Speaker B: Wow… that’s awesome! I’ve always thought that’s a gr8 perk myself! ### Speaker A: Yeah, it's better than just a discount cause I shouldn't eat out too much since it's expensive and it saves me a little money on meals.  The food is good too. ### Speaker B: That is really nice! What’s your schedule like? Do you work on weekends also? ### Speaker A: Unfortunately.  I usually work a double on Saturday and I work Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday 8 hours each roughly.  It all depends on how busy we get.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited!

    "prediction": "Explanation: \nMemory 1 provides relevant information about Speaker A's perks at the restaurant and hints at the possibility of taking home leftover baked goods, which is directly related to Speaker B's question about getting a free dessert. However, it contains additional irrelevant information about a fire incident that could be distracting. Memory 2, while repetitive, consistently focuses on the free meals and leftover baked goods, which offers stable context for the current discussion about restaurant perks and could directly address Speaker B’s query about dessert.\n\nChoice: 2"
