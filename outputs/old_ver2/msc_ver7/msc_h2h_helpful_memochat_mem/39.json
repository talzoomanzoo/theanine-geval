What was your experience like? ### Speaker B: I was a little nervous because of all the training and equiprments, but the guides I had in Hawaii were amazing. Once I got under the water and adjusted to breathing through the air tank - it was really funny. I can't even describe the beauty. ### Speaker A: I really hope that I get to go one day. I can't even imagine how amazing that would be.  ### Speaker B: You will love it. Once I did it the first time, I was hooked.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 seems more helpful because it directly mentions aspects of Speaker B's life and interests that relate to animals and science, which are relevant to the conversation about pet snakes and Speaker B's interest in reptiles. While MEMORY 2 provides more detailed context about Speaker B's experience with scuba diving and the naming of the snakes, it doesn't add as much to the immediate question about taking the snakes to the college dorm.\n\nChoice: 1"
