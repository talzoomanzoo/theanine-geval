    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant about the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science, and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics. \nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities. \nSpeaker B majoring in linguistics causes Speaker A to be interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n3. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n4. Speaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\n5. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n6. Speaker A is involved with a football league and is looking forward to playing games.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is focused on a discussion about career options in teaching. Speaker A expresses an interest in teaching robotics and is supportive of Speaker B's decision to pursue a stable teaching career. Speaker B appreciates Speaker A's interest in teaching robotics and comments on their intelligence. The memory should provide relevant background to help Speaker A respond accordingly. \n\nMemory 1 provides relevant background about both speakers' academic interests and aspirations in teaching, specifically Speaker A's focus on teaching computer science and robotics, which is directly relevant to the dialogue. It also suggests a connection between Speaker B's studies and Speaker A's interest, which adds depth to the interaction.\n\nMemory 2 contains useful information about both speakers' academic interests, but it includes extraneous details, such as volunteering and involvement in football, which are not relevant to the current conversation. The added detail about both valuing education is relevant but less specific to the dialogue context than Memory 1's information.\n\nChoice: 1"
