    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is focused on Speaker A expressing interest in learning how to make spicy fried rice from Speaker B. Memory 2 contains more detailed information about Speaker A's interests and experiences with cooking, including their general enjoyment of cooking, finding it helpful for stress relief, and their inclination to make food for others, which aligns well with the interest they have expressed in the dialogue. This makes Memory 2 more useful for Speaker B to personalize their response or suggest further cooking activities, thus making it more helpful than Memory 1.\n\nChoice: 2"
