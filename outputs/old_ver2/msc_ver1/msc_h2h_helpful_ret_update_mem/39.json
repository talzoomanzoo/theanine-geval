One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha!\nSpeaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes?\nSpeaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe. \nSpeaker A: You make them sounds so fascinating. Will you take them with you to your college dorm?  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B recently divorced their wife and loves to scuba dive in Hawaii when not working. Speaker A is scared of sharks but finds the idea of going into a steel cage with them interesting. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n\nSpeaker B recently divorced their wife and loves to scuba dive in Hawaii when not working. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans.

Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans.\n3. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n4. Speaker A's interest in neuroscience was further fueled by their experience in a research lab and being in the Eagle Scouts.\n5. Speaker A is interested in scuba diving and neuroscience, with experience in a research lab.\n6.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses on Speaker B's interest in snakes and reptiles, and a question about whether they will take their snakes to their college dorm. MEMORY 2 is more relevant as it provides concise information about Speaker B's pet snakes, Speaker B's interest in animals over humans, and Speaker A's plans related to studies and lab work. These aspects are helpful to frame a response related to college and animal care decisions. MEMORY 1 contains additional irrelevant context about diving, divorce, and plans for neuroscience, which are not directly helpful for the current snake-focused conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
