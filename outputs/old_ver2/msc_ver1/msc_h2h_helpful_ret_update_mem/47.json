    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant about the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well?\nSpeaker B: The older one seems to like it while the youngest cannot be bothered. Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon?\nSpeaker A: Yes!  As a matter of fact, I'm visiting my son that lives in Spain next month.  This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now!\nSpeaker B: Oh nice. You must be looking forward to it. He must have told you a lot about her. Do you think you would like her? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A has multiple sons, at least one of them is in a relationship with a Spanish girlfriend. Speaker A has two sons, one of whom has a girlfriend and the other is secretive and possibly gay. Speaker A has two sons who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next. Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe. Speaker B's younger son would be jealous of Speaker A's sons' European tour. Speaker B's sons would possibly get along well with Speaker A's sons.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A has two sons who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next.\n2. Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe.\n3. Speaker B's younger son would be jealous of Speaker A's sons' European tour.\n4. Speaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite worrying about them traveling far away.\n5. Speaker B has two sons, one of whom has had a girlfriend for several years and the other is secretive.\n6. Speaker B's sons would possibly get along well with Speaker A's sons.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides information about Speaker A's emotional perspective, specifically mentioning that Speaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite having concerns about them traveling far away (#4). This is relevant to the dialogue context where Speaker B asks if Speaker A thinks they would like their son's girlfriend, as this perspective provides insight into Speaker A's personality and openness, which is useful for formulating a context-appropriate response. MEMORY 1 contains similar elements, but it does not provide this specific personal insight, which is directly useful to understanding Speaker A's family interactions.\n\nChoice: 2"
