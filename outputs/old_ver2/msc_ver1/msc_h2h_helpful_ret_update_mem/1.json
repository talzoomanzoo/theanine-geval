    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant about the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B, who does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies, wants Speaker A to teach them how to swim and programming. Speaker B also enjoys cruising in their car while listening to punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming. On the other hand, Speaker A, who enjoys cruising and has a favorite club in school, causes Speaker A to plan snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination. This leads to Speaker A and Speaker B discussing the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n2. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n4. Speaker A is planning a snorkeling trip and has signed up for several trips.\n5. Speaker B is afraid of cruises because they can't swim.\n6. Speaker B is looking forward to eating a pizza burger in a pool with punk music playing.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context indicates that Speaker B is looking forward to the meetup where they will learn to swim and possibly join Speaker A on a cruise in the future. Memory 1 contains relevant and helpful information about Speaker B's interest in swimming, programming, and punk music. It also aligns with Speaker A's interest in cruising, making a cohesive context for planning snorkeling and considering cruise possibilities. Memory 2, although it includes some of the same points, introduces new elements like Speaker B's fear of cruises and the pizza burger, which detract from the immediate relevance and could confuse the conversation context. Therefore, Memory 1 provides more focused and useful information for responding to the dialogue context. \n\nChoice: 1"
