Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\nSpeaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing?  \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker A mentions having eight grandchildren and already having blue hair. Speaker B has an oldest nephew who is about to turn 14.\n2. Both Speaker A's mother and Speaker A were librarians, but Speaker A is retired. Speaker B asks if the recommended book is fiction or nonfiction.\n3. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one. Speaker A, a retired librarian, recommends the book \"Beautiful Ruins\" by Jess Walter for a beach visit.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Family growth', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A reflects on how her youngest grandchild is growing up fast, now at 14 years old.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: She's 14, so still has a few years to go.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context ends with Speaker A asking Speaker B about their nephew. MEMORY 1 provides useful information about Speaker B's nephew, stating that he is about to turn 14. This information directly relates to Speaker A's inquiry about the nephew, enabling Speaker B to respond meaningfully to the question about their nephew. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, discusses Speaker A's perspective on family growth and mentions a grandchild, which is unrelated to Speaker B's nephew and thus not as helpful for the immediate context.\n\nChoice: 1"
