    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context focuses on a conversation about Speaker B's pet snakes and their interest in reptiles. Speaker A is curious if the snakes will be taken to Speaker B's college dorm. Relevant and helpful information would therefore be directly related to Speaker B's experience and attachment with the snakes, as well as their college plans regarding pets. MEMORY 1 describes Speaker B's love for reptiles, mentioning he has two snakes named Hansel and Gretel, and contains a detail about Speaker B's college plans using the GI Bill. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, primarily highlights Speaker B's experiences with scuba diving, and although it does mention the snakes, it focuses more on the naming aspect and doesn't address college. Thus, MEMORY 1 is more directly related and helpful for the current dialogue context, where the question is about taking snakes to college.\n\nChoice: 1"
