I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science, and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics. \nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities. \nSpeaker B majoring in linguistics causes Speaker A to be interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\n3. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n4. Speaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\n5. Speaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\n6. Speaker A is studying computer science and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves Speaker A expressing interest in teaching robotics, and Speaker B appreciating that interest. Therefore, relevant information should support Speaker A's interest in robotics and Speaker B's background and considerations. MEMORY 1 offers details about Speaker A's aspirations in developing apps for differently abled youth besides teaching, which aligns closely with the teaching interest mentioned in the dialogue. It also provides relevant information about Speaker B's field and future educational considerations, which helps understand the context of their conversation about career paths. Overall, MEMORY 1 presents a cohesive view of both participants' educational interests and goals in a way that follows the conversation's direction.\n\nMEMORY 2, while it includes similar points, also contains additional details about Speaker B's volunteering which were not discussed in the dialogue context and are less relevant to the immediate exchange.\n\nChoice: 1"
