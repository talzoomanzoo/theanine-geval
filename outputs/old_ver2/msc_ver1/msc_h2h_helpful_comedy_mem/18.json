    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant about the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college?\nSpeaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position. \nSpeaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it?\nSpeaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \nSpeaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living.\nSpeaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime?\nSpeaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with.\nSpeaker A: Sounds great! Now the tough question: when do you have time? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket but now plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week. They are a member of a soccer team and enjoy playing in tournaments. \nSpeaker A is a college student majoring in Humanities, not currently employed but used to work part-time at a supermarket. Lately, Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description: Speaker A is a college student majoring in Humanities, who loves playing soccer, especially as a striker scoring goals. They are excited for upcoming tournaments and are a fan of Arsenal and international teams. Speaker A is single and still on the soccer team.\n\nRelationship Description: Speaker A and Speaker B have a friendly relationship, with Speaker A offering to take Speaker B out for lunch when they were broke. Speaker B enjoys music, especially Black Sabbath, and shares a love for soccer with Speaker A.\n\nEvent Description: Speaker A had a guidance meeting and is considering a career in humanities or teaching. Speaker B found a job as a law clerk and enjoys researching and writing briefs. They both appreciate humanities, with Speaker A staying in the field for now. Speaker A and Speaker B have discussed career prospects and shared moments of support and friendship, such as offering to pay for lunch or lending college books in exchange for burgers.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The Dialogue Context revolves around Speaker A and Speaker B discussing soccer and potentially playing together. Memory 1 focuses on Speaker A's past work and current involvement in soccer, which is somewhat relevant. Memory 2, however, provides more comprehensive insights into the relationship between the speakers, their shared interest in soccer, and past gestures of friendship. This additional context could be valuable for Speaker B to determine available times for casual soccer games together, while also understanding the social dynamic they share.\n\nChoice: 2"
