    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses generally align with Speaker B's past experience as a therapist. However, Response 2 is more consistent with the memory that Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years, as it references \"all these years,\" implying a longer duration of being in the field, which matches the known history. Response 1, while accurate, lacks the nuance of \"all these years,\" which is a distinct element of Speaker B's past.\n\nChoice: 2"
