Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\nSpeaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\nSpeaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\nSpeaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.\nSpeaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe?\nSpeaker B: There is some weird chemical mix that I really do not mess with.  It is easy to clean up.  I try to stay away from this part of the movies.  I know what it should look like and that we want to keep everyone safe when using the fake blood.\nSpeaker A: Chemicals!  Do the actors hate working with it then?  I can imagine they are a pretty high maintenance bunch.  Do they worry about the blood messing with their looks? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Actually, most actors are pretty chill about it. They understand it's all part of the job.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: Most of the actors are pretty professional about it. They understand it's all part of the job. We make sure to use safe and easy-to-remove blood so they don't have to worry too much about their looks. It's all about creating the right atmosphere on set.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses provide insights into the actors' attitudes towards using fake blood. Response 2 offers additional detail that aligns with Speaker B's earlier statement about using safe and easy-to-remove blood, which is consistent with the past memory where Speaker B emphasizes the importance of keeping everyone safe when using fake blood. Response 1 lacks this additional context.\n\nChoice: 2"
