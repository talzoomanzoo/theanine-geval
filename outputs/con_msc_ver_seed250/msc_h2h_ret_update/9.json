That's really exciting! \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Definitely! I'm looking forward to seeing how the cloning process unfolds.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: Definitely! I'm eager to see how advancements in molecular biology will impact the field of agriculture. It's an exciting time to be involved in research.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The second response (RESPONSE 2) is consistent with the past memories, as Speaker B is interested in neuroscience and is planning to major in molecular biology. There is no contradiction with the past information since it ties the conversation back to Speaker B's interest in lab work and research, which aligns with their academic goals. RESPONSE 1, on the other hand, is also consistent but lacks the mention of the broader implications of molecular biology, which is a known interest of Speaker B. Therefore, RESPONSE 2 provides a more complete alignment with past memories regarding Speaker B's interests and academic plans.\n\nChoice: 2"
