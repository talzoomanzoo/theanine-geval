However, Response 2 adds more detail about the potential family trip and the kids' interest in trying new foods. These details are not mentioned in the past memories, but they do not contradict any past information. Therefore, both responses are consistent, but Response 1 directly answers Speaker A's question without additional assumptions.\n\nChoice: 1"
