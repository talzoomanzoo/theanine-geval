Both responses align with Speaker B's suggestion to use fertilizers instead of bugs. However, Response 2 is slightly more aligned with the current conversation as it directly acknowledges and reiterates Speaker B's advice on bugs and provides an endorsement of using fertilizers, which was specifically discussed in the current conversation about indoor gardening.\n\nChoice: 2"
