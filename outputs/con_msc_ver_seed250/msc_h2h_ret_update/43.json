    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\" or \"2\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nSpeaker A is able to teleport by thinking clearly about a place.\nSpeaker A is an inventor who built a transporter before learning to teleport innately.\nSpeaker A is working on going back in time.\nSpeaker A uses the energy of puppies to power the teleportation machine.\nSpeaker A struggles with teleporting clothes, aiming for a full closet.\nSpeaker B works in IT and enjoys running.\nSpeaker B is aware of the movie \"Jumper\" and enjoyed it.\nSpeaker B is involved in programming work.\nSpeaker A has a therapist and has experienced disassociation or imagining themselves in different places due to past experiences.\nSpeaker A mentioned having a childhood experience with a squirrel that \"flew\" briefly due to jumping on a trampoline.\nSpeaker B is going to Alaska for a vacation in two weeks and has some experience with flying on airplanes.\nSpeaker B has programming experience but has not created their own invention.\nSpeaker A and Speaker B share a sense of humor and make each other laugh during the conversation.\nSpeaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking.\nSpeaker A is concerned about the safety of Speaker B and suggests getting a hiking tour guide.\nSpeaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet.\nSpeaker B is not a fan of fishing but is interested in hiking and seeing a moose.\nSpeaker A is nervous about traveling alone and prefers having someone familiar around during new adventures.\nSpeaker B is comfortable traveling alone and enjoys the spontaneity it allows.\nSpeaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together.\nSpeaker A mentions the outdoor activities they plan to do in Alaska, such as hiking.\nSpeaker B jokes about being eaten by mosquitoes during their time outdoors in Alaska.\nSpeaker B is unsure about what else there is to do in Alaska besides hiking.\nSpeaker A has the impression that Alaska is cold and snowy, wondering if there are ski slopes there.\nSpeaker B mentions that southern Alaska has warmer temperatures in the summer.\nSpeaker A mentions that Alaska has mountains and glaciers, unsure if skiing is possible there.\nSpeaker A talks about the common perceptions of Alaska being cold, dark, and known for oil drilling.\nSpeaker B agrees that Alaska is beautiful but acknowledges the presence of mosquitoes.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends?\nSpeaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do.\nSpeaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars.\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I think they go dark for a couple months and then have daylight for a couple months! I actually like night time, but having daylight all the time will make me crazy lol. Yeah I kind of hope it's dark for the camping but it will be very cold. I have heard Alaska has delicious ice cream. I want to try that while I'm there, \nSpeaker A: You'd have to get some serious blackout curtains for when it was daylight lol! You'll have to stock up on some warm essentials before heading out. You definitely don't want to get stuck in a bad situation in the cold, especially if you're alone. I bet they have great ice cream! You'll have to tell me about it when you get back!\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I need to call my friend and find out what season they are in so I can pack accordingly. I will take pictures of the ice cream too so I can tell you about it. I wonder if there are a lot of bears there? I don't like bears either.\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty sure they have grizzlies up there. You better pack something to fend them off too just in case. I bet your friend knows everything you'd need to keep them away.\nSpeaker B: I will bring whatever they let me bring on the airplane, but I am really counting on my friend to help me out with the local customs lol. Do you know if Rocky and Bullwinkle were from Alaska? \nSpeaker A: No, they were from Minnesota. Are you going to have your friend be your hiking guide?\nSpeaker B: I invited my friend to come stay at the lodge where I'm vacationing and he said it would be fun to get away for a bit. So I'm hoping he will show me around for a week or so. I might have to hire a hiking guide, it depends on how much he knows about hiking and grizzlies I think. What do you think? Should I hire someone?\nSpeaker A: I think it could be a good idea, especially with all the large animals in Alaska and the terrain. I wouldn't rely on your friend and have someone more professional that knows a lot just in case. I'm sure the guide could also give you tons of suggestions of things to do while in the area, and maybe even the best ice cream places lol! \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I think it might be a good idea to hire a hiking guide, just to be safe. I'll ask my friend if he knows of any good ones in the area. I want to make sure I have a great time on this trip!\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: That's a good point. I'll look into hiring a professional guide to ensure a safe and enjoyable trip. It would be great to have someone knowledgeable about the area and activities. I'll make sure to ask them about the best ice cream spots too!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are consistent with the past memories and the current conversation as they align with Speaker B's previously mentioned consideration of hiring a hiking guide. Neither adds any conflicting information. However, Response 2 reflects a slightly more detailed consideration of hiring a professional and aligns with Speaker A's suggestion more directly, though both are valid choices. Neither response references anything unrelated to the situation or contradicts any memory, so they are equally consistent.\n\nChoice: 1 (as both choices are equally consistent, the choice between them is arbitrary)"
