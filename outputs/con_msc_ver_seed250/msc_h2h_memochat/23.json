Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever.

It's great that you find solace in riding your horses though, there's something special about that bond.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: It's great that you have found therapy in riding your horses, but talking to someone could also be beneficial for addressing any unresolved childhood trauma. Therapy can provide a safe space for exploring and processing these experiences.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nBoth responses are consistent with the past memories by acknowledging Speaker A's use of horse riding as a therapeutic activity and the potential benefits of therapy for addressing unresolved issues. Neither response contradicts any past memory or known fact about either speaker's background, beliefs, or experiences. However, both responses also align without introducing any new or conflicting information.\n\nChoice: Since both are consistent, you can choose either one. However, the choice here is more stylistic based on the overall tone you may prefer:\nChoice: 1"
