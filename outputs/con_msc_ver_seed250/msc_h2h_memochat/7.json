It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that.

I can definitely help you with computer programming as well during our meetup this weekend.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: That sounds like a great idea! I would be happy to teach you about computer programming, especially if we can incorporate punk music and pizzaburgers into our study sessions like we discussed before. Looking forward to it!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are consistent with the past memories, as Speaker A has already offered to teach programming and Speaker B is interested in learning. However, Response 2 is more consistent with the memory of incorporating punk music and pizzaburgers into their study sessions, which was something Speaker B expressed interest in before. This aligns with the past memory where Speaker B wants to listen to punk music and enjoy pizzaburgers while learning programming. Response 1 does not contradict any past memory but lacks this specific detail from their prior discussion.\n\nChoice: 2"
