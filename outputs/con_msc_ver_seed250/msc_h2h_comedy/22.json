Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I do still enjoy being a therapist, but it definitely has its challenges. It's rewarding to help people navigate through their struggles.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B:  I can imagine that listening to people's problems all day can be draining at times, but the satisfaction of helping them must make it all worth it. Just like how taking care of your horses brings you joy and fulfillment. It's all about finding that balance between giving and receiving, and I'm sure you do a great job at it.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses appear consistent with the past memories provided. Response 1 directly answers the question with Speaker B sharing they still enjoy being a therapist despite the challenges, aligning with past memories where Speaker B mentions the ups and downs of the profession. Response 2 also aligns by acknowledging the challenges and satisfaction of being a therapist and makes a relevant analogy to Speaker A's enjoyment of taking care of horses. However, Response 2 assumes Speaker A does a great job at balancing giving and receiving, which is not previously mentioned. Thus, while neither response directly contradicts past memories, Response 1 is more straightforward and safer in terms of maintaining consistency as it doesn't introduce an assumption not clearly supported by past memories.\n\nChoice: 1"
