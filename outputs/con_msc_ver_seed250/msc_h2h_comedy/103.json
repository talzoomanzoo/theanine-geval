And don't forget to take care of yourself and prioritize your well-being, just like we talked about after Dave twisted his ankle. Good luck with your last final and enjoy your break!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses seem to align with the context of their conversation, acknowledging Speaker A's progress with exams. However, Response 2 mentions managing sore muscles, which is consistent with Speaker B's background in sports medicine. It also references prioritizing well-being, a topic that both speakers discussed in the past. Response 1, while consistent, lacks these connections to the past memories about Speaker B's knowledge and advice sharing on well-being.\n\nChoice: 2"
