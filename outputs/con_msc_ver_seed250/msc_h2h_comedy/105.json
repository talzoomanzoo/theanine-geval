It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \nSpeaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on?\nSpeaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study?\nSpeaker B: Ah, English should be easier than History. Sure, I can help you. What do you need to do exactly? Write an essay?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, we have to write an essay and we have a spelling component towards the end of the exam, I sure could use a little help! \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Of course, I'd be happy to help you with studying for your English final. Just let me know when you're free to go over everything.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B:  I'm glad to hear that your history exam went well! I'm sure you'll do great on your English final too. And of course, I'd be happy to help you study. Maybe we can take a break from studying soccer strategies and focus on essay writing instead. And don't worry, I'll make sure to bring some extra water for you during the study session, just like we did during our hike with Dave. Let's make sure you're all set for your last final!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 2 contains information that is inconsistent with the past memories. Speaker B did not go hiking with Dave; it was Speaker A who went hiking with Dave as indicated in the past memories. Therefore, mentioning a shared hike with Dave is a contradiction. Response 1, on the other hand, does not contain any contradictory information and remains consistent with the past memories.\n\nChoice: 1"
