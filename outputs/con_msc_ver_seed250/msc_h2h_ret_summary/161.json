The locations mentioned in both responses do not conflict with any past memory information. The past memories do not specify the exact locations of past camping trips, so either a national park or mountains near a lake could fit within possible camping trip locations. Therefore, both responses are consistent with the provided memories.\n\nChoice: 1 (or 2)"
