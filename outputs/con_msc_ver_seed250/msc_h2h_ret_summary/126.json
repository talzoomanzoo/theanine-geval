Let me know how \"Girl Next\" turns out!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nNeither response contradicts the past memories directly, but both incorrectly identify Speaker B's job as a Film Studies professor, which is inconsistent with the past memories. Speaker B used to teach Film Studies but does not mention currently holding that position. However, Response 2 acknowledges this job in its current form, while Response 1 does not. Furthermore, Response 2 asks for feedback on \"Girl Next,\" which fits with the context of sharing movie recommendations. Given these factors, Response 2 is slightly more consistent with the past conversation concerning the current relationship and the sharing of movie recommendations.\n\nChoice: 2"
