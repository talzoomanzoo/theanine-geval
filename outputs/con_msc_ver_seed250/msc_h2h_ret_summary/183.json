    "prediction": "Explanation: Based on past memories, Speaker B is open to moving to the countryside to enjoy a more peaceful life and has expressed that they want to move away from neighbors and enjoy the space the country offers. However, they haven't specifically stated they prefer the countryside over the city, only that they appreciate what the country has to offer.
