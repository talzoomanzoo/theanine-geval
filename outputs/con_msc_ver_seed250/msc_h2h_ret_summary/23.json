Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Therapy can definitely be helpful in processing past experiences. It's great that you find solace in riding your horses though, there's something special about that bond.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: It's great that you find therapy in riding your horses. Horses have a unique way of connecting with people and can be really therapeutic. If you ever decide to try therapy, I'd be happy to help guide you through the process.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses acknowledge Speaker A's attachment to their horses as a form of therapy, which aligns with what Speaker A mentioned in the conversation. However, Response 1 is more consistent since it does not suggest that Speaker B is offering to guide Speaker A through the therapy process personally. Response 2 implies that Speaker B might directly help Speaker A in therapy, which could be seen as a potential conflict of interest, considering Speaker B's profession where it's illegal to have relationships with clients.\n\nChoice: 1"
