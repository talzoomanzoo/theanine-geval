Let me address the task based on the given information:\n\nExplanation: The past memories mention that Speaker B is considering becoming a college professor in linguistics but feels limited in job opportunities within that field. Response 2 is consistent with this information by acknowledging both the promise of teaching and Speaker B's concern about the limited opportunities in linguistics. Response 1, while acknowledging teaching as a stable option, does not reflect Speaker B's specific concern about linguistics job opportunities. Therefore, Response 2 aligns better with the past memories.\n\nChoice: 2"
