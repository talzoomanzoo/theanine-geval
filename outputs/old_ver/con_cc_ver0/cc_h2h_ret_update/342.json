    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nCo-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen as a thoughtful gesture.\nCo-worker B finished a project and sent it to the manager for review.\nCo-worker A believes the project will be approved with flying colors.\nCo-worker B appreciates the pen and thanks Co-worker A for the gesture.\nCo-worker A took over the family business and made changes to adapt to modern times.\nCo-worker A's father was hesitant to hand over the business but now trusts Co-worker A.\nCo-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen as a symbol of trust in their professional relationship.\nBoth Co-worker A and Co-worker B value trust in their personal and professional relationships.\nCo-worker A has a family business that has been doing well recently.\nCo-worker A made changes to modernize processes and invest in new technology for the business.\nCo-worker B acknowledges the importance of finding a balance between work and relaxation.\nBoth co-workers enjoy relaxing and taking breaks from work to appreciate the beauty around them.\nCo-worker A fell down a flight of stairs and injured their leg.\nCo-worker B offered to help by getting crutches for Co-worker A.\nCo-worker A took over their family's business a few years ago and it has improved since then.\nCo-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen that they still use.\nCo-worker A is frustrated that they can't walk properly due to their leg injury.\nCo-worker A wishes they could be outside on the balcony enjoying the weather and music.\nCo-worker B suggested that Co-worker A should see a doctor for their leg injury.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nCo-workers A: I just gave my boss the written report. I hope she finds it helpful. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers B: I'm sure she'll appreciate the effort you put into it. Good job on completing the report!\nRESPONSE 2\nCo-workers B: That's great! I'm sure she'll appreciate your effort. You always do such thorough work.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses acknowledge Co-worker A's effort in completing the report and express confidence that the boss will appreciate the work. However, neither response explicitly recalls past memories such as Co-worker A's role in improving the family business, the symbolic exchange of the pen, prior work achievements, or mutual appreciation for each other's efforts. Although Response 2 builds on Co-worker B’s belief in Co-worker A’s consistent performance, it doesn’t strongly tie back to specific past memories from the list.\n\nChoice: tie"
