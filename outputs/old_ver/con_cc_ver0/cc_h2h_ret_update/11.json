Building a new support system takes time, but you'll find your rhythm. Just remember, you're not alone in this transition.\nRESPONSE 2\nMentor: It's completely understandable to feel that way, especially when you're in a new environment. Making new friends takes time, but I'm sure you'll find your place soon. In the meantime, remember that I'm here for you whenever you need to talk.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses offer empathetic support to the Mentee as they adjust to their new environment. However, Response 2 provides a stronger reflection of past memories, notably the Mentor's ongoing support and guidance. This aligns with the Mentor's role in offering support during new experiences, such as the Mentee's decision to take the job in the city and when the Mentee felt overwhelmed with other challenges. The phrase \"I'm here for you whenever you need to talk\" reflects the Mentor's consistent presence, akin to the guidance and support mentioned in the past memories.\n\nChoice: 2"
