    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nNeighbor A is building a new house for Neighbor B with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard.\nNeighbor A enjoys building houses and finishing them quickly.\nNeighbor B is grateful and surprised by the generous offer from Neighbor A.\nNeighbor A started construction on the house last week and plans to finish it in record time.\nNeighbor B is looking forward to seeing the finished house and is excited about the new project.\nNeighbor A considers Neighbor B a great neighbor and wanted to do something special for them.\nNeighbor B has not been up to anything interesting lately but is excited about the new house and looking forward to it.\nNeighbors A helped Neighbors B build a new house with amazing features.\nNeighbors A values their friendship with Neighbors B, describing them as a great neighbor.\nNeighbors A had help from friends in building the new house.\nNeighbors B is grateful for the help and quick completion of the new home.\nNeighbors B is enjoying the sunset from their new backyard, expressing gratitude towards Neighbors A.\nNeighbor A is considering a career as a con-artist, believing they are good at manipulating people.\nNeighbor B is against Neighbor A's idea, emphasizing the ethical and legal implications.\nNeighbor A believes they can make a lot of money without hurting anyone and plans to cover their tracks carefully.\nNeighbor A has skills in manipulation and getting what they want.\nNeighbor B reminds Neighbor A of their potential to do good things, referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them.\nNeighbor A considers using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder.\nNeighbor A and Neighbor B discuss organizing a community event to make a positive impact and appreciate the beauty of their city.\nNeighbors A enjoys taking care of flowers and finds it calming.\nNeighbors B admires Neighbors A's gardening skills and wishes to have a green thumb.\nNeighbors A believes that plants need sunlight, water, and love to thrive.\nNeighbors B received a new house built by Neighbors A and is grateful for the extra space.\nNeighbors A found building the new house challenging but rewarding.\nBoth neighbors appreciate nature and the beauty of sunsets.\nNeighbors A and B value gratitude and being alive to witness incredible moments.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination.\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off.\nNeighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks?\nNeighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else.\nNeighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location?\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home.\nNeighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become.\nNeighbors A: You're right, I need to stop making excuses and just get it done. Thanks for the advice. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nNeighbors B: You got this! Just take it one step at a time and you'll finish that project in no time.\nRESPONSE 2\nNeighbors B: You're welcome! Remember, taking small steps towards your goal is better than not moving at all. Good luck with your project!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "However, I can provide an analysis based on the criterion specified.\n\nLooking at the past memories, Neighbor B had previously reminded Neighbor A of their potential to do good things by referencing the house that Neighbor A built for them. This reflection indicates that Neighbor B values positive reinforcement for Neighbor A's accomplishments. Both responses in the current conversation focus on encouragement and motivation, recalling Neighbor B's supportive nature.\n\nResponse 1 emphasizes taking one step at a time, aligning with the idea of breaking down tasks into manageable parts, which was suggested by Neighbor B earlier in the conversation. However, it does not explicitly recall any of the past memories.\n\nResponse 2 mirrors the sentiment of taking small steps toward a goal, which is akin to Neighbor B's advice during the conversation about setting specific goals and tasks. Although it does not recall past memories directly, it aligns well with the advice-giving role Neighbor B has previously had, such as encouraging Neighbor A during the house-building process.\n\nNeither response strongly recalls the specific past memories about the house or Neighbor B's encouragement regarding the potential for good things Neighbor A had built, but both are consistent with Neighbor B's role based on their past interactions. \n\nSince neither response stands out significantly in terms of memorability regarding past memories linked directly to the situation, it would be reasonable to conclude that they are very close in addressing the need for motivation and positive reinforcement.\n\nChoice: tie"
