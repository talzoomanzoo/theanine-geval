It's been overwhelming but also incredibly exciting.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 1 recalls past memories of Neighbor A's ongoing development in telekinetic abilities. It builds on the history of Neighbor A practicing telekinesis, which Neighbor B was already aware of and supportive towards. This enhances the ongoing theme of Neighbor A's telekinetic journey. On the other hand, Response 2 mistakenly reintroduces the idea of developing telekinetic abilities as if it were a new event rather than an established narrative, which reduces its reflection on past occurrences related to telekinesis development.\n\nChoice: 1"
