    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 focuses on recalling a specific memory related to workplace issues and the importance of resolving them, aligning with past memories where Co-worker A was stressed about their relationship with Co-worker B and how they worked through it. However, it doesn't directly highlight Co-worker A's growth, which is a key theme in the past memories. Response 2, on the other hand, directly acknowledges Co-worker A's progress and the journey from fantasizing about being a great leader to actually taking on a leadership role. It also aligns well with the theme of growth and support highlighted in the past memories. Thus, Response 2 better reflects the co-worker's shared history and Co-worker A's development, making it more memorable.\n\nChoice: 2"
