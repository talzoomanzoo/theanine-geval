This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn.\nTeacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation?\nStudent: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle.\nTeacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nStudent: Yes, I've heard that before. I guess I'll have to start small and work my way up to handle the heat better.\nRESPONSE 2\nStudent: Yeah, I've heard that! Maybe I should start slowly increasing my tolerance so I can enjoy it without feeling like my mouth is on fire every time. Thanks for the tip!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses discuss building a tolerance to spicy foods, which isn't directly linked to any of the past memories. However, the conversation doesn't provide any situational cues or context that connects to past memories about saving a child, retiring, stress, or language studies. Neither response recalls past memories. Both focus on the student's approach to handling spicy foods without touching on or relating to their previous experiences or conversations mentioned in the memories.\n\nChoice: tie"
