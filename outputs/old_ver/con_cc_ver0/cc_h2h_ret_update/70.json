    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 2 better reflects the past memories as it not only addresses the promise made by Classmate A to not let insecurities affect their friendship, but it also ties back to the positive aspects of their relationship that have been emphasized throughout their memories: supporting each other and building each other up. This is in line with their history of mutual admiration, openness to exploring connections, and being great study partners. Furthermore, it aligns with past memories of both individuals aspiring for growth and improvement, whether in their academic, personal, or shared interests. Response 1, while acknowledging understanding, doesn't emphasize the commitment to mutual support as vividly.\n\nChoice: 2"
