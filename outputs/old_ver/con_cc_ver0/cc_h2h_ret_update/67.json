    "prediction": "Explanation: \nBoth responses from Classmate B begin by acknowledging their surprise at Classmate A's feelings of jealousy. However, Response 2 goes a step further by expressing a desire to work through the issue together, indicating a commitment to resolving misunderstandings and maintaining the relationship. Although neither response directly references specific past memories, Response 2 implicitly draws on their past positive interactions and mutual admiration, such as enjoying each other's company and being great study partners, which suggests a foundation for working through conflicts together. Therefore, Response 2 has a slightly higher level of memorability as it better aligns with their history of open communication and exploration of a deeper connection.\n\nChoice: 2"
