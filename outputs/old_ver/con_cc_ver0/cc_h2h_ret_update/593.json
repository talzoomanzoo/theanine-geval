    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nThe husband fell asleep during the wife's movie, showing a lack of interest or attention.\nThe wife is knowledgeable about movies and is willing to share her passion with the husband.\nThe husband is open to learning more about movies, showing a willingness to try again.\nThe husband and wife plan to have a movie night together in the future.\nThe husband has found a partner named Sarah and wants to marry her, despite still being married to his current wife.\nThe wife is surprised and upset by the husband's news and feels betrayed.\nThe husband acknowledges that it may be difficult for the wife but wants to be honest about his feelings for Sarah.\nThe wife compares the situation to when the husband fell asleep during a movie she recommended, indicating past issues in their relationship.\nThe husband claims to have a real connection with Sarah and wants to find a way to move forward while still considering his current marriage.\nThe wife is unsure about moving forward with the husband and Sarah and needs time to think about it.\nBoth the husband and wife express a desire for happiness and understanding in the situation.\nHusband uses old-fashioned language like \"thou\" and \"thee\" due to how he was taught to speak.\nWife suggests that husband should try using more modern language to be better understood.\nWife brings up Sarah, the husband's previous partner, but husband says he hasn't thought about her much.\nHusband admits caring for Sarah deeply but realizing his mistake and that his heart belongs to his wife.\nHusband agrees to try adapting to modern language for better communication with his wife.\nThe husband gave a fifth-grade presentation in the past.\nThe wife remembers the husband being nervous before the presentation.\nThe husband felt like he was being judged and humiliated during the presentation.\nThe husband talks differently than most people, using words like \"thou\" and \"thee.\"\nThe wife reassures the husband that it's okay to be different and encourages him to embrace who he is.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nHusband: I'm feeling stuck with my writing. I've been searching everywhere for new ideas, but nothing seems to work.\nWife: Have you tried brainstorming with me? Sometimes bouncing ideas off of someone else can help.\nHusband: I have, but I don't want to bother you too much with my writing stuff.\nWife: Nonsense! You can always come to me with anything. Plus, I enjoy helping you with your creative process. Have you also tried revisiting some of the writing prompts we did in our creative writing class?\nHusband: I have, but I feel like I'm just repeating the same stories over and over again.\nWife: Maybe it's time to take a step back and try something new. Have you ever tried writing in a different genre or experimenting with different styles?\nHusband: That's a good idea. I guess I just haven't had the courage to step out of my comfort zone.\nWife: Remember when you faced your fear of public speaking during your fifth-grade presentation? You can do this too. Sometimes, the biggest breakthroughs come from taking risks.\nHusband: You're right. Maybe it's time to try something completely different and see where it takes me. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nWife: I believe in you, and I know you have the creativity and talent to explore new horizons. Just take that leap of faith and see where it leads you.\nRESPONSE 2\nWife: I'm glad you're open to trying new things. Remember, I'll always be here to support you, no matter what direction your writing takes. Just believe in yourself and your creativity, and you'll see amazing results.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 1 focuses on encouragement and building confidence in the husband's ability to succeed creatively. It does not directly connect to any specific past memory, but rather offers general support and motivation. On the other hand, Response 2 reflects the wife's continuous support and recalls her consistent availability and willingness to help the husband, as evidenced in their conversation about discussing writing prompts and her overall encouragement to embrace his uniqueness. Response 2 therefore better reflects past memories involving the wife's supportiveness and encouragement for the husband to be himself and embrace risks.\n\nChoice: 2"
