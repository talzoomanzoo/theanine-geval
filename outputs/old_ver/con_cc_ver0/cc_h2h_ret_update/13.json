Response 2 not only acknowledges the Mentee's feelings but also provides actionable advice similar to the mentor's past guidance strategies, such as when the Mentor advised the Mentee on handling challenges with studying by breaking tasks down. This advice to join clubs or organizations aligns with the Mentor's previous supportive, guidance-focused interactions, drawing on their supportive role in the Mentee's life. However, both responses lack direct references to shared past experiences or memories.\n\nChoice: tie"
