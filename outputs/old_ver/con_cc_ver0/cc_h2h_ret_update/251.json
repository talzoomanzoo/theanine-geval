    "prediction": "Explanation: \nNeither of the given responses (1 or 2) directly references or recalls past memories from their shared work history or personal details. The existing conversation mainly revolves around Co-worker A singing a solo at church, an event that doesn't have a direct tie to their past memories of working at a clothing store, planning a dinner, or other shared experiences. Both responses suggest planning a karaoke night, which somewhat aligns with the theme of enjoying and sharing talents, but does not link back to specific shared experiences or knowledge from the past. The past memory concerning Co-worker A's talent and detective skills or mutual experiences at the clothing store are not reflected in either response.\n\nChoice: tie"
