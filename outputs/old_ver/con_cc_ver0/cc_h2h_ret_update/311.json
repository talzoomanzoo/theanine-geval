I feel like we have something special going on here.\nClassmates B:  You're right. Our class definitely has a unique energy about it. What do you think sets us apart from other classes?\nClassmates A:  I think it's our sense of community. We all support each other and work together to achieve our goals.\nClassmates B:  That's definitely a big factor. And I also think our class has a lot of diversity, which brings new perspectives and ideas to the table. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nClassmates A: I agree, diversity is key. It helps us see things from different angles and learn from each other's experiences.\nRESPONSE 2\nClassmates A: I completely agree. The diversity in our class is truly enriching. It's amazing how we can all come together and learn from each other's unique experiences and viewpoints.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses reflect the current conversation's focus on diversity and learning from each other's experiences. However, neither response recalls or references past memories more than the other. Since both options engage equally with the themes discussed but do not connect to past experiences or memories shared between the classmates (such as their bond from mall visits or the emotional experiences they went through), the decision based solely on Memorability results in a tie. The lack of connection to past memories means neither response excels in Memorability.\n\nChoice: tie"
