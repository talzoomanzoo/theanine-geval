    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses reflect Neighbors A's excitement and the transformative potential of the inheritance. However, Response 2 aligns more with past conversations about life-changing events and making a difference, similar to Neighbors A's big career change and subsequent happiness. It echoes the theme of taking advantage of new opportunities discussed in their past job search, reflecting on personal growth and making a positive impact. Response 1, while expressing excitement, lacks the depth of reflection on past themes of change and growth.\n\nChoice: 2"
