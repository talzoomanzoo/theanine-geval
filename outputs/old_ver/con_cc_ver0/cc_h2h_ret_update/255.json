What did you sing?\nCo-workers A: I sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites.\nCo-workers B: That's such a beautiful song. You have a great voice.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! It was really nerve-wracking, but I'm glad I did it.\nCo-workers B: I'm sure the audience loved it. You've really got some talent.\nCo-workers A: Thanks again.

Time really does fly.\nRESPONSE 2\nCo-workers B: Time really does fly, doesn't it? It feels like just yesterday we were all working together at the clothing store. Those were some fun times.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 2 is more closely tied to past memories. It explicitly refers to the time when they were working together at the clothing store, which is a memory shared between the two co-workers. This enhances the memorability aspect of the conversation, as it recalls their past experiences and happy memories from their joint employment. Response 1, on the other hand, introduces a new element related to school events and Ms. Singh, which does not draw upon the already mentioned shared memories involving their past at the clothing store.\n\nChoice: 2"
