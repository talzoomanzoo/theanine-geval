    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nCo-worker A witnessed a fight and intervened to separate the two women.\nCo-worker B commended Co-worker A for their bravery and willingness to help.\nCo-worker A spoke with the police about the incident and the women involved were thankful.\nCo-worker B mentioned helping a customer resolve an issue last week, showing a willingness to assist others.\nCo-worker A was in a car accident and lost their hands and feet.\nCo-worker A is alive but will need time to adjust to their new way of life.\nCo-worker B is supportive and willing to help in any way.\nCo-worker A will need all the help they can get during their recovery.\nCo-worker A is trying to stay positive and focus on their recovery, despite it being a daunting task.\nCo-worker A is remembered for being brave and strong in past situations.\nCo-worker A has a positive attitude and focuses on making people happy despite facing challenges like losing their hands and feet.\nCo-worker B admires Co-worker A's resilience and positivity.\nCo-worker A believes in surrounding oneself with positive energy and uplifting people.\nCo-worker A intervened to help two women who were fighting, showing bravery and a desire to make a positive impact.\nCo-worker A is humble and tries to make the world a better place by helping others.\nCo-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\nCo-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\nCo-worker A is described as positive and able to stay optimistic even in challenging situations, like the accident where they lost their hands and feet.\nCo-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's positivity and friendship.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers B: You can't force someone to be with you, Co-worker A. It's important to respect her choices and feelings.\nRESPONSE 2\nCo-workers B: I understand that you have strong feelings, but kidnapping someone is never the solution. Let's talk about this and see if there's a better way to handle the situation.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The focus here is on Memorability, which involves recalling and reflecting on past memories. Response 2 is more aligned with the past memories because it reflects on Co-worker B's supportive nature and willingness to help Co-worker A find a better solution, similar to how B has shown support previously. Although neither response explicitly mentions past events, Response 2's approach to problem-solving and support is consistent with the dynamics and interactions present in their history where Co-worker B has admired Co-worker A's resilience and advised them on positive actions, such as when Co-worker A felt guilty over borrowing a pencil. This reflection of Co-worker B's supportive and solution-oriented nature ties back to the past memories more effectively than Response 1.\n\nChoice: 2"
