Response 1 reflects deeper memorability by tying the Mentor's advice not just to keeping in touch with old friends but also to continuing to explore new opportunities in the city, which mirrors previous instances where the Mentee has successfully navigated challenges with the Mentor's support—such as deciding on the job in the city or handling the collee application stress.\n\nChoice: 1"
