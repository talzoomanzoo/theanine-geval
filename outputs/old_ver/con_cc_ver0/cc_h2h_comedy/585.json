The wife reassures the husband by mentioning that he has a unique voice, connecting it back to a past experience. Additionally, Response 2 incorporates the idea of watching a movie together, which ties into their past plans for a movie night, reinforcing their shared interest in movies. The mention of finding each other unexpectedly also builds on the theme of their relationship. Response 1, while offering practical advice, does not incorporate any past memories.\n\nChoice: 2"
