This response acknowledges Neighbor A's dedication and self-improvement, and even recalls the missing dog situation, showing attentiveness to Neighbor B's recent distress. On the other hand, Response 1 is more generic encouragement and does not touch upon any specific past memory or event that has transpired between Neighbors A and B.\n\nChoice: 2"
