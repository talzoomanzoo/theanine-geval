I might have to treat myself to a nice dinner to celebrate.\nRESPONSE 2\nCo-workers A:  That's amazing! I had no idea you could sing so well. You must have wowed everyone at church. It's great to see your talents shine outside of work. Let's celebrate your solo performance with a nice dinner this weekend, what do you think?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 makes a connection to the past memory where Co-worker A and Co-worker B both planned to treat themselves to a nice dinner with their paychecks, but does not directly reflect on any specific past memory related to their working relationship or other shared experiences. \nResponse 2, on the other hand, not only addresses the idea of celebration, which can connect to their past memory of celebrating detective work with drinks, but also takes a step further by proposing to have a dinner this weekend. This more closely echoes their shared enjoyment of dining out as mentioned in their past interactions. Therefore, Response 2 demonstrates higher Memorability by making a more specific reference back to past conversations and shared history about celebrations and dinners.\n\nChoice: 2"
