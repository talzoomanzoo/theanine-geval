    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither of the responses recalls or reflects any past memories directly related to the situation at hand, which is a discussion about hot sauce. However, Response 2 makes an attempt to recall a past memory by referencing the student's bravery and quick thinking when saving a kid from drowning. Although this is somewhat out of context for a conversation about hot sauce, it still demonstrates an effort to connect the past memory with the current dialogue. Response 1, on the other hand, does not involve any past memories and purely focuses on the present situation without reflection.\n\nChoice: 2"
