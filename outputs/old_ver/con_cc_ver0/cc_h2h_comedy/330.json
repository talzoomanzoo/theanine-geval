How about you?\nNeighbors A: Oh, I'm doing alright. I was just thinking about the old days when I had my rock band. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nNeighbors B: I remember those days! Your rock band was awesome.\nRESPONSE 2\nNeighbors B:  Definitely. Oh, and remember that time I burned the roast? You were so supportive and I appreciated it. Your praise for how I handled the stress really meant a lot to me.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 2 exhibits a stronger link with past memories by recalling a specific moment that complimented the stress management skills of Neighbor B and appreciated Neighbor A's support. This indicates a deeper connection and reflection on past shared experiences, enhancing Memorability. Response 1, on the other hand, merely mentions the rock band, which was not a memory previously recorded, making it less memorable based on the provided past memories.\n\nChoice: 2"
