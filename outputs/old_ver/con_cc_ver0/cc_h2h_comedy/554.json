Let's make some music together!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The two responses from Classmate B differ in the level of recall from past memories. Response 2 references making music together, which ties directly to past memories where Classmates A and B enjoy jamming together and plan to collaborate on music in the future. Even though the conversation does not transition directly into music-related topics, Classmate B's mention of making music together harkens back to their shared experience and mutual goal of collaboration. Response 1, while supportive and responsive to Classmate A's suggestion on independence, does not draw on any specific shared memories or experiences outside of the current conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
