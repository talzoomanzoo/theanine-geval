Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nThe parent was taken to juvenile detention for getting into trouble with the law.\nThe child is supportive and caring towards the parent.\nThe parent expresses fear and upset about the situation.\nThe child offers help and reassurance to the parent.\nBoth the parent and child express love and support for each other.\nThe Parent has been in juvenile detention in the past.\nThe Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations.\nThe Child finds the Parent's story inspiring.\nThe Parent eventually got to see the sunrise after leaving detention.\nThe Parent and Child plan to watch the sunrise together in the future.\nThe parent mentions making mistakes in the past and trying to turn their life around.\nThe child is supportive and proud of their parent for making changes.\nThe parent wants to provide a safe and stable environment for the child.\nBoth the parent and child enjoy spending time together in their new home.\nThe parent and child have a special tradition of having breakfast together in the backyard and watching the sunrise.\nThe child recalls a memorable morning watching the sunrise with the parent.\nThe parent suggests repeating the sunrise-watching tradition on a future weekend.\nThe parent values independence and self-sufficiency.\nThe parent had a tough time when they got arrested and had to rely on a lawyer and the justice system for help.\nThe parent now lives in a little house in the suburbs that they love.\nThe child is supportive and willing to help out if needed.\nThe parent is currently focused on taking care of themselves and enjoying their independence.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life.\nChild: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you.\nParent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you.\nChild: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nParent: I did feel that way at times, but I learned the importance of listening and being heard through those tough experiences. It's something I try to remember every day.\nRESPONSE 2\nParent:  Yeah, I remember when you were in detention. It was really tough, but I tried my best to listen and support you. I know how important it is to feel heard, especially during difficult times. I'm always here for you, no matter what.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 directly refers to the parent's past experience in detention and how it taught them valuable life lessons about listening and being heard. This draws on the memory of the parent's past struggles and personal growth during and after detention. Response 2, however, incorrectly refers to the child being in detention, which is inconsistent with the past memories provided. It does not align with the context of the parent's experience or the child's support towards the parent. Therefore, Response 1 effectively recalls and reflects on the past memories making it more memorable according to the criterion.\n\nChoice: 1"
