    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 2 more effectively recalls past memories by depicting a specific instance when the husband managed to catch the bus on time. It directly references the past memory where the husband had to run to catch the bus and felt exhilarated. This recollection is in line with the wife bringing up that specific moment, and it ties back to how small victories have a meaningful impact, thus creating a stronger link to past memories. Response 1, while reflecting on the general idea that little moments add up in life, doesn't invoke any past memory with the same specificity and detail as Response 2.\n\nChoice: 2"
