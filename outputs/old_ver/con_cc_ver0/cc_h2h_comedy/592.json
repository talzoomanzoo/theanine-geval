I've been searching everywhere for new ideas, but nothing seems to work.\nWife: Have you tried brainstorming with me? Sometimes bouncing ideas off of someone else can help.\nHusband: I have, but I don't want to bother you too much with my writing stuff.\nWife: Nonsense! You can always come to me with anything. Plus, I enjoy helping you with your creative process. Have you also tried revisiting some of the writing prompts we did in our creative writing class?\nHusband: I have, but I feel like I'm just repeating the same stories over and over again.\nWife: Maybe it's time to take a step back and try something new. Have you ever tried writing in a different genre or experimenting with different styles?\nHusband: That's a good idea. I guess I just haven't had the courage to step out of my comfort zone.\nWife: Remember when you faced your fear of public speaking during your fifth-grade presentation? You can do this too. Sometimes, the biggest breakthroughs come from taking risks. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nHusband: You're right. I need to channel that same courage into my writing. I'll give it a shot and see where it takes me. Thanks for the reminder.\nRESPONSE 2\nHusband:  You're right, I remember how you encouraged me to face my fear of public speaking during that fifth-grade presentation. I guess it's time for me to take a leap of faith and step out of my comfort zone with my writing. I'll give writing in a different genre a try and see where it takes me. Thanks for always being so supportive and patient with me.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 2 demonstrates higher memorability by explicitly recalling the wife's encouragement during the husband's fifth-grade presentation. It acknowledges her support and patience, linking the past memory of the husband's fear and her support in overcoming it to the current situation of trying something new in writing. This reflection of past memories makes Response 2 more memorable, as it ties previous experiences to current challenges within the conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
