    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 2 is more memorable as it reflects the ongoing theme of mutual support and community between Neighbors A and B. It specifically refers to the history of mutual help and support they've given each other, which is a key part of their past interactions. In contrast, Response 1 provides general advice about self-care, which does not directly reference their past memories or shared experiences.\n\nChoice: 2"
