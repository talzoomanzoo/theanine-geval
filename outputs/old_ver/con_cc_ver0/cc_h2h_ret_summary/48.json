    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nCo-worker A had a fall in the morning and feels dizzy and disoriented.\nCo-worker A is considering seeing a doctor to ensure everything is okay.\nCo-worker A has been feeling off lately.\nCo-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to prioritize their health.\nCo-worker A values their health to continue working at their best.\nCo-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A.\nCo-worker A offered PersonZ to Co-worker B in exchange for one of their horses.\nCo-worker A wanted the chestnut mare that Co-worker B owns.\nCo-worker A has been riding PersonZ and finds her great.\nCo-worker A had anxiety about their health but after seeing a doctor everything was fine.\nCo-worker B is supportive and glad that Co-worker A is okay.\nCo-worker A is grateful to Co-worker B for letting them borrow the horse and is having a great time riding her.\nCo-worker B is generous and allows Co-worker A to ride any of their horses anytime.\nCo-worker A struggled in school, had troubled parents, and felt like they had little guidance growing up.\nCo-worker B was surprised to learn about Co-worker A's past struggles.\nCo-worker A now has a good job and is doing well, despite their difficult upbringing.\nCo-worker A expressed gratitude for the horse that Co-worker B gave them, mentioning it brings joy and happiness.\nCo-worker B is glad to have been able to help Co-worker A and feels the trade worked out well for both of them.\nCo-worker A wants to become business partners with Co-worker B in the future.\nCo-worker B is impressed with Co-worker A's well-thought-out plans for their partnership.\nBoth co-workers believe they have the potential to create something great together.\nCo-worker A feels motivated about the future and is excited to work with Co-worker B.\nCo-worker B agrees that their skill sets complement each other well.\nBoth co-workers are looking forward to starting their partnership and are open to seeking extra help if needed.\nCo-workers A and B have a positive and optimistic attitude towards their future collaboration.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers B: It's been pretty hectic, but I'm managing. How about you?\nRESPONSE 2\nCo-workers B: Hey, it's actually been manageable today. How about you?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The current conversation does not directly address any specific past memories that would significantly differentiate between these two responses in terms of memorability. Both responses acknowledge the inquiry about workload but neither one recalls any shared experiences, past events, or previously established connections between co-workers A and B, as detailed in the provided memories. Thus, there's no particular reflection of past memories in either response that enhances memorability. Given this, neither response stands out clearly with respect to the criterion of memorability.\n\nChoice: tie"
