Have you tried studying or working in a different location?\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home.\nNeighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nNeighbors A: Thanks for the reminder.

Thanks for the advice, I'll head to the library now and get to work.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses display a commitment to overcoming procrastination by changing scenery to the library. However, neither response directly recalls or references any past memories, such as the neighborly assistance in building the house or their discussions on procrastination and goals.  As both responses are equally lacking in memorability, a tie is appropriate.\n\nChoice: tie"
