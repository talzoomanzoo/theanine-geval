    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response directly mentions past memories. However, Response 2 acknowledges the concern Classmate A has about feeling jealous of Classmate B's success and offers a constructive approach by suggesting they support each other's talents. This aligns more closely with their past interest in exploring a romantic connection and considering themselves as great study partners, indicating an attempt to improve their relationship dynamic. While the context of Classmate A's jealousy isn't explicitly linked to specific past conversations or events, the gesture of wanting to talk things through is in line with the openness and friendship that characterized their relationship previously.\n\nChoice: 2"
