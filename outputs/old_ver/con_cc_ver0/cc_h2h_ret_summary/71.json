    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nNeighbors A enjoys cooking and made roasted vegetables and quinoa for dinner.\nNeighbors B is interested in Neighbors A's cooking and asks about the vegetables and quinoa preparation.\nNeighbors A used sweet potatoes, carrots, Brussels sprouts, and squash for the roasted vegetables, cooked the quinoa in vegetable broth.\nNeighbors A focuses on healthy and flavorful plant-based meals.\nNeighbors B is open to trying new recipes and is excited to receive the chickpea curry recipe from Neighbors A.\nNeighbors A and B are discussing the idea of having telekinetic abilities.\nNeighbors A mentions the practical uses of telekinesis, like grabbing things from a distance.\nNeighbors B expresses concerns about accidentally moving objects and causing unintended consequences.\nNeighbors A compares mastering telekinesis to cooking, requiring patience and trial-and-error.\nNeighbors A and B both acknowledge the potential benefits of telekinesis despite the risks involved.\nNeighbors A and B joke about the fun aspects of using telekinesis to surprise people.\nNeighbors A and B share a dream of developing telekinetic abilities together in the future.\nNeighbors A has gained the ability to move objects with their mind.\nNeighbors B is excited and supportive of Neighbors A's new ability.\nNeighbors A has been practicing moving small objects with their telekinesis.\nNeighbors A is overwhelmed but also excited about their new ability.\nNeighbors A enjoys trying new things, like new recipes.\nNeighbors A made a roasted vegetable and quinoa dish that Neighbors B enjoyed.\nNeighbors A is considering incorporating their telekinesis into their cooking in the future.\nNeighbor A is feeling unfulfilled with their job and wants to make a bigger impact.\nNeighbor A is considering looking for a new job but is unsure of what they want to do.\nNeighbor A feels there is no room for growth or new projects at their current job.\nNeighbor A is thinking about exploring new skills or hobbies outside of work, such as taking online courses or learning a new language.\nNeighbor B suggests that new skills could lead to new opportunities in Neighbor A's current job or future career.\nNeighbor B offers support and suggests planning a dinner to celebrate Neighbor A's new adventures in learning.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nNeighbors A: Hey, can you keep a secret? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nNeighbors B: Of course! What's the secret?\nRESPONSE 2\nNeighbors B: Of course! What's going on?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nBoth responses are quite similar and neither directly recalls a specific past memory. However, by considering the context of the past interactions, which include sharing personal achievements like practicing telekinesis, learning new skills, supporting one another, and planning a dinner, both responses could accommodate such a context where Neighbors A would reveal a secret related to any of these areas. Therefore, both responses fit the scenario without strongly recalling any particular past memory.\n\nChoice: tie"
