Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nNeighbors A saw something they believe to be a UFO and are still shaken up about it.\nNeighbors B is supportive and believes Neighbors A's story, suggesting looking up UFO sightings in the area.\nNeighbors A's husband thinks they are crazy for believing they saw a UFO.\nNeighbors A plans to do some research and possibly report the sighting of the UFO.\nNeighbors A appreciates Neighbors B's understanding and willingness to listen and talk about the experience.\nNeighbor A is tired from work and needs to catch up on sleep.\nNeighbor B is upset that Neighbor A doesn't want to go to the party with them.\nNeighbor B is worried about looking stupid if they show up at the party alone.\nNeighbor A didn't know they wouldn't feel up for the party until now.\nNeighbor A suggests planning something else to do together over the weekend.\nNeighbor A mentions seeing a UFO and wants to discuss it with Neighbor B.\nNeighbors A is feeling stagnant in their current job and is looking for more growth and challenge.\nNeighbors B has been supportive of Neighbors A's job search, offering to connect them with people in different industries.\nNeighbors A plans to start looking for new opportunities soon and needs to update their resume and start networking.\nNeighbors B has knowledge of people in different industries and is willing to help Neighbors A with their job search.\nNeighbors A believes they saw a UFO in their backyard and still thinks it was real, finding it crazy to think about.\nNeighbors A made a big career change recently and is much happier now.\nNeighbors B is considering taking a vacation to a town with beautiful beaches.\nNeighbors A and B had a conversation a couple of years ago about needing a change.\nNeighbors A took the leap to make a change and is glad they did.\nNeighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's decision and admires the courage it took.\nNeighbors A and B have a friendly and supportive relationship.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nNeighbors A: Can you believe it? I'm a millionaire now!\nNeighbors B: Wow, that's incredible! How did it happen?\nNeighbors A: I inherited it from a distant relative. It's still sinking in, to be honest.\nNeighbors B: That's amazing, congratulations! What are you going to do with all that money?\nNeighbors A: Well, first I'm going to pay off my mortgage and all my debts. After that, I think I'll take a nice long vacation and maybe donate some to charity.\nNeighbors B: That's very generous of you. Have you thought about investing any of it?\nNeighbors A: Yes, actually. I've been doing some research and I think I want to invest in some stocks and maybe even start my own business.\nNeighbors B: That sounds like a great idea. You have the opportunity to do so much with your newfound wealth.\nNeighbors A: Definitely. It's funny how things can change so quickly. Just a few years ago, I was stuck in a job I hated and now I have all this freedom.\nNeighbors B: Speaking of jobs, have you thought about what you want to do now? You don't really have to work if you don't want to. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nNeighbors A: I'm considering exploring some new career opportunities now that I have this financial freedom. It's an exciting time for me.\nRESPONSE 2\nNeighbors A: I've actually been thinking about that a lot. I've always loved helping people and making a difference, so I'm considering starting a non-profit organization to focus on causes that are important to me. It's something I've always dreamed of doing, and now I have the means to make it a reality.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 2 reflects past memories better as it ties back to Neighbors A's history of making a career change and being happier, as well as the support and encouragement from Neighbors B about pursuing new opportunities. Additionally, it connects with Neighbors A's desire to help people and make a difference, which aligns with starting a non-profit. While Response 1 touches on exploring new career opportunities, it lacks the depth and connection to the personal growth and changes discussed in past interactions.\n\nChoice: 2"
