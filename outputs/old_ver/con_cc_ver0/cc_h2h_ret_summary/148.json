    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 clearly recalls past memories about Neighbor A making great memories in their current neighborhood and connects it to the potential of creating new ones in the new neighborhood. It also reflects the excitement of a fresh start which ties back to Neighbor A's recent move to a new neighborhood and their enthusiasm for exploring and settling in. This response ties in more past memories than Response 2, as it explicitly mentions the past positive experiences Neighbor A has had in their current neighborhood, suggesting a similar outcome for the new neighborhood.\n\nChoice: 1"
