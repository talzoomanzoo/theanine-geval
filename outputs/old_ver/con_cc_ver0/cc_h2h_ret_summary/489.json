It's great to see you taking charge of your education and learning from your experiences. If you ever need help with anything, I'm always here for you.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 focuses on the immediate application of the skills learned in the computer course without recalling any past memories. Response 2, however, connects the current achievement (completion of the computer course) with a past memory of how Classmates A has matured and progressed since middle school. It acknowledges the growth that Classmates A has experienced, learning from past mistakes and taking charge of their education. This reflects the memorability criterion more effectively by linking the current conversation with past experiences and recognizing the support and relationship dynamics between the classmates.\n\nChoice: 2"
