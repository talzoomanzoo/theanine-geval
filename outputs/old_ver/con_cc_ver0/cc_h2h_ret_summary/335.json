    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nNeighbor A has been dealing with back pain for a few months but sought help from a chiropractor, avoiding surgery.\nNeighbor B is interested in chiropractic care after hearing about Neighbor A's positive experience.\nNeighbor A found the chiropractor through a friend's recommendation and found the treatments to be relaxing.\nNeighbor B is experiencing neck pain and considering trying chiropractic care as a natural alternative to medication.\nNeighbor A offered to provide the name of their chiropractor to Neighbor B if they decide to go.\nNeighbors A and Neighbors B enjoy playing together with toys.\nNeighbors A mentions having back pain and needing a break.\nNeighbors A has visited a chiropractor recently for their back pain.\nNeighbors B expresses concern for Neighbors A's back pain.\nNeighbors A plans to go back to the chiropractor for another session.\nNeighbors A looks forward to playing with Neighbors B again when feeling better.\nNeighbors A recently moved to London from their current location.\nNeighbors A packed up their belongings and moved into a small apartment in London.\nNeighbors A is enjoying the different culture and exploring the city.\nNeighbors A has already visited major tourist attractions like Big Ben and the London Eye.\nNeighbors A found some of their dog's toys while packing, indicating they have a golden retriever.\nNeighbors B is familiar with Neighbors A's dog and looking forward to playing with it again.\nNeighbors A burned the roast and felt angry and out of control.\nNeighbors B suggested trying anger management techniques like deep breathing or meditation.\nNeighbors A moved to London in the past and had to learn how to manage stress.\nNeighbors A appreciated the support and friendship of Neighbors B.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, how's it going?\nNeighbors B: Not bad, thanks. How about you?\nNeighbors A: Oh, I'm doing alright. I was just thinking about the old days when I had my rock band.\nNeighbors B: Really? You had a band?\nNeighbors A: Yeah, we were called \"The Neighbors A Band.\" We used to play live shows around the city.\nNeighbors B: That's awesome! What kind of music did you guys play?\nNeighbors A: We played rock music, mostly covers but we also wrote some of our own songs.\nNeighbors B: Have you ever thought about starting the band again? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nNeighbors A: I've thought about it, but with my recent move to London and focusing on my health, it's been on the back burner.\nRESPONSE 2\nNeighbors A: I've thought about it, but my back has been acting up lately so I'm not sure if I could handle long hours of practicing and performing. But I do miss those days of jamming out with the band.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 2 directly references Neighbor A's past struggle with back pain, which is a consistent theme in the past memories and is related to their recent experiences with a chiropractor. This response also ties in Neighbor A's health issues as a reason for not restarting the band, showing a strong connection to past memories. On the other hand, Response 1 does reference the recent move to London, which is also a part of the past memories, but it does not mention the back pain or health focus as clearly as Response 2 does in relation to Neighbor A's current priorities and constraints. Therefore, Response 2 has higher memorability as it more thoroughly integrates past memories into the conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
