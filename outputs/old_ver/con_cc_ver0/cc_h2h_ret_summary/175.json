There is also an emphasis on the parent valuing cherishing moments and seeking the child's support and involvement in their ventures. Response 2 reflects this by not only sharing the parent's hope about their project but also expressing appreciation for the child's interest, which aligns with the supportive and communicative relationship evident in past memories.
