Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nClassmates A and B have a good relationship, with Classmates A expressing admiration for Classmates B's intelligence and sense of humor.\nClassmates A has developed a crush on Classmates B, which Classmates B finds flattering.\nBoth Classmates A and B are open to exploring a romantic connection and are looking forward to getting to know each other better.\nClassmates A suggests grabbing lunch together, showing an interest in spending more time with Classmates B.\nClassmates A and B are interested in biology and studying cells.\nClassmates A has taken an anatomy class and studied different types of cells that make up organ systems.\nClassmates B is considering taking biology classes in college to learn more about how the body works.\nClassmates A finds it refreshing to talk to someone genuinely interested in science and learning.\nBoth Classmates A and B enjoy talking to each other and consider themselves great study partners.\nClassmate A is balancing high school and college classes to be successful and help their family.\nClassmate A is considering majoring in biology or the medical field.\nClassmate A is passionate about science and interested in becoming a doctor or researcher to help people and make a difference.\nClassmate B admires Classmate A's dedication and believes they have a knack for science.\nClassmate A has seen Lady Gaga in concert three times before and is a big fan of her.\nClassmate B has never been to a Lady Gaga concert before.\nClassmate A loves Lady Gaga's music and message of acceptance and inclusivity.\nClassmate A's favorite Lady Gaga song is \"Born This Way.\"\nClassmate B's favorite Lady Gaga song is \"Bad Romance.\"\nBoth classmates are excited about seeing Lady Gaga in concert and are looking forward to singing and dancing along to her hits.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nClassmates A: , I need to talk to you about something important.\nClassmates B: Sure, what's on your mind? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nClassmates A: I've been thinking about our upcoming science project. Do you have any ideas on what topic we should choose?\nRESPONSE 2\nClassmates A: I've really enjoyed our time together studying biology and talking about cells. I was wondering if you'd like to grab lunch together sometime and maybe explore more than just being study partners.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 2 makes use of multiple past memories. It recalls the mutual interest in biology and studying cells, the shared experience of being study partners, and Classmate A's previous suggestion of grabbing lunch together to show a personal interest in Classmate B. It also subtly references Classmate A's feelings and the possibility of exploring a romantic connection, which aligns with both classmates' willingness to consider that possibility. In contrast, Response 1 solely addresses the science project, which while relevant to their shared interest, does not reflect as many past memories as Response 2 does.\n\nChoice: 2"
