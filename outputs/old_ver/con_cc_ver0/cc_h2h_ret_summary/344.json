    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nCo-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen as a thoughtful gesture.\nCo-worker B finished a project and sent it to the manager for review.\nCo-worker A believes the project will be approved with flying colors.\nCo-worker B appreciates the pen and thanks Co-worker A for the gesture.\nCo-worker A took over the family business and made changes to adapt to modern times.\nCo-worker A's father was hesitant to hand over the business but now trusts Co-worker A.\nCo-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen as a symbol of trust in their professional relationship.\nBoth Co-worker A and Co-worker B value trust in their personal and professional relationships.\nCo-worker A has a family business that has been doing well recently.\nCo-worker A made changes to modernize processes and invest in new technology for the business.\nCo-worker B acknowledges the importance of finding a balance between work and relaxation.\nBoth co-workers enjoy relaxing and taking breaks from work to appreciate the beauty around them.\nCo-worker A fell down a flight of stairs and injured their leg.\nCo-worker B offered to help by getting crutches for Co-worker A.\nCo-worker A took over their family's business a few years ago and it has improved since then.\nCo-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen that they still use.\nCo-worker A is frustrated that they can't walk properly due to their leg injury.\nCo-worker A wishes they could be outside on the balcony enjoying the weather and music.\nCo-worker B suggested that Co-worker A should see a doctor for their leg injury.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nCo-workers A: I just gave my boss the written report. I hope she finds it helpful.\nCo-workers B: Did you make sure to include all the necessary details?\nCo-workers A: Yes, I made sure to cover everything we talked about in the meeting. I even added some extra information that I thought could be useful. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers B: That's great, I'm sure your boss will appreciate the thoroughness of the report.\nRESPONSE 2\nCo-workers B: That's great! I'm sure your thoroughness will impress the boss. Your attention to detail always shines through in your work.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses acknowledge Co-worker A's effort and thoroughness in creating the report. However, neither response directly references past memories. While Response 2 uses more descriptive language discussing Co-worker A's attention to detail, this aspect isn't explicitly tied to any specific past memories provided. Both responses relate to the act of submitting a report and the anticipation of a positive response, which aligns with past memories of Co-worker B finishing projects, sending them for review, and Co-worker A believing they will be successful. In terms of direct recall or reflection of past events, both responses are similar, lacking a direct connection to previously mentioned memories such as the pen symbolizing trust, the importance of balance, or previous successful project completions.\n\nChoice: tie"
