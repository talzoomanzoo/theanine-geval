Having a supportive boss can make all the difference in how you feel about your job. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers A: Yes, it really does. I feel like I can grow and take on new challenges knowing that my boss is behind me.\nRESPONSE 2\nCo-workers A: I completely agree. Their support has really helped me grow and push myself to new heights.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses acknowledge the support of a boss and how it enables growth, but neither reference the past memories of the relationship between Co-worker A and Co-worker B or any significant past events. They don't reflect on their past experiences together or any notable changes that occurred in their lives related to the provided memories. Therefore, in the absence of past memory recall, neither response demonstrates greater memorability than the other.\n\nChoice: tie"
