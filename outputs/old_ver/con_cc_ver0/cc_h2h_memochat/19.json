    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses recognize the Mentee's new friendship and encourage the building of new relationships. However, Response 1 slightly reflects back to the Mentee's decision to move to the city and is more focused on encouraging new experiences in the new environment, which relates to the Mentee's transition and adaptation mentioned in the past memories. Response 2, while supportive, does not directly build on these past memories of the decision-making process and the Mentee's goals of connecting in the new city.\n\nChoice: 1"
