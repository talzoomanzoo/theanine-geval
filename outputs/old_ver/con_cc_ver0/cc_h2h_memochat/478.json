    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses involve the topic of improvements in thinking skills from studying algebra, however, neither response recalls past memories directly. None of the provided responses reference the past memories related to competitiveness, support, or handling personal issues that were discussed between Classmates A and B. Therefore, in terms of Memorability based on the given past memories, both responses are tied as they do not explicitly incorporate past experiences or discussions.\n\nChoice: tie"
