    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nNeighbor A mentioned cleaning up a tree house to prevent insects and spiders from living in it.\nNeighbor A emphasized the importance of keeping outside spaces clean and maintained for the future.\nNeighbor B recalled a past experience where their tree house was destroyed due to lack of proper care.\nNeighbor A highlighted the cost-effectiveness of taking care of belongings, whether inside or outside.\nNeighbors A and B live in the same neighborhood and help each other with tasks.\nNeighbors A emphasizes the importance of recognizing and thanking each other for acts of kindness.\nNeighbors B agrees and mentions the sense of community that is built through helping each other.\nNeighbors B recalls when Neighbors A helped with their lawn, showing mutual support between them.\nBoth neighbors appreciate the support and assistance they provide each other, making their neighborhood feel like a real community.\nNeighbors A and B are helpful towards each other.\nNeighbors B helped Neighbors A with groceries and picking out fruits and vegetables.\nNeighbors A cleaned a tree house to avoid bugs and spiders.\nNeighbors B enjoys keeping things clean and tidy.\nNeighbors A wants to rearrange their living room and Neighbors B has experience with rearranging furniture.\nNeighbors A and B are planning to work together to rearrange the living room over the weekend.\nNeighbors A is detail-oriented and strives for perfection.\nNeighbors B is supportive and understanding of Neighbors A's mistake.\nNeighbors A values appreciation and expresses gratitude for help received.\nNeighbors B values reciprocity and acknowledges the mutual help between them as neighbors.\nNeighbors A and B have a positive and helpful relationship as neighbors.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nNeighbors A: I'm sorry you had to hear me swear like that. I shouldn't have lost my temper like that.\nNeighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset?\nNeighbors A: It was just something that happened at work. My boss was being unreasonable and I couldn't take it anymore.\nNeighbors B: That's understandable. Have you tried talking to your boss about it?\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I have, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I just feel like I'm stuck in a dead-end job.\nNeighbors B: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you considered looking for a new job?\nNeighbors A: I have, but with the current job market, it's really tough. Plus, I don't have a lot of experience in other fields.\nNeighbors B: Well, I'll keep an ear out for any job openings that might be a good fit for you. In the meantime, maybe try finding ways to de-stress after work? I find that exercise helps me when I'm feeling frustrated. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nNeighbors A: Thanks, I appreciate that. I'll give exercise a try and see if it helps me unwind after work.\nRESPONSE 2\nNeighbors A: It sounds like you're going through a tough time at work. It's important to find healthy ways to de-stress. Remember, we all make mistakes and face challenges, but it's how we handle them that matters. If you ever need to talk or vent, I'm here for you.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nBoth responses provide support, but Response 1 acknowledges and appreciates Neighbor B's suggestion about exercise, which echoes the past memory of Neighbors A expressing gratitude for help received. Response 1 also aligns with the memory of Neighbors A recognizing others' acts of kindness and supportâ€”here B offers job leads and de-stress advice. While Response 2 provides general encouragement, it somewhat misunderstands the direction of support as it implies Neighbor B faces work challenges, which is not the case in this scenario. This misdirects from the mutual past experiences and misapplies it to B instead of A.\n\nChoice: 1"
