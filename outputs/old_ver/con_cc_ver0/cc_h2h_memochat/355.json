The coach's response ties in the idea of mental relaxation and the journey analogy to emphasize the value of keeping a fresh mind, which is reminiscent of prior discussions on the importance of not letting distractions, like unfavored gum taste, affect one's focus. It draws on the athlete's acknowledgment of small changes leading to better performance, just as taking a scenic route could provide mental relaxation, potentially aiding focus in the next training as mentioned in past interactions.\nChoice: 2"
