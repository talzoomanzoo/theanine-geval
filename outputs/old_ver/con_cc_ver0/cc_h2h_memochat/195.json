    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 aligns better with the past memories as it acknowledges Co-worker B's consistent support, which has been a recurring theme in their interactions. Co-worker A shows appreciation for the support and encouragement that Co-worker B has provided, reflecting on past moments where Co-worker B has encouraged and helped Co-worker A to pursue leadership roles. Responding with gratitude resonates with their shared history of discussing leadership aspirations and overcoming self-doubt. Response 2 repeats information already discussed, lacks personal reflection, and does not add memorability by revisiting significant shared experiences or acknowledgment of past support.\n\nChoice: 1"
