Don't worry about misplacing your glasses, it happens to all of us sometimes.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Apologies, it seems that there has been a misunderstanding. The focus of this task is on the memorability in relation to the past memories shared between the mentor and the mentee, rather than on your training data.\n\nExplanation: \nResponse 1 better aligns with the past memories as it references the mentor's supportive nature and attention to detail, which echoes the mentor's ongoing support in various aspects of the mentee's journey (including the recovery journey and living in the moment). This shows a form of gratitude similar to the mentee thanking the mentor for their previous guidance and support. On the contrary, Response 2 seems out of place as it addresses the mentee rather than the mentor, and it lacks connection to specific past interactions or appreciations.\n\nChoice: 1"
