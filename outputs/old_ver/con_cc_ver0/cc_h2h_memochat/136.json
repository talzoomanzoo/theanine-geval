    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses acknowledge Neighbor A's positive experience in exploring the new city. However, neither response directly references past memories that would enhance memorability, such as their previous experience organizing a block party together, Neighbor A's love for exploring the neighborhood, or the connection between exploring new places and finding comfort in their current neighborhood. Since both responses focus on the immediate experience of the new city without tapping into these past memories, they are similar in terms of memorability.\n\nChoice: tie"
