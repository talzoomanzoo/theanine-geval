    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses provide encouragement and advice to Neighbor A on overcoming procrastination. However, neither response explicitly references past memories or shared experiences between the neighbors, such as building the house or sharing a friendship. Thus, they show equal lack of recall of past memories and do not exhibit higher memorability over one another.\n\nChoice: tie"
