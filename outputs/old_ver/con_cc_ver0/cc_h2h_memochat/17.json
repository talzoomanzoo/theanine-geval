    "prediction": "Certainly! Here's the evaluation of the responses based on the available past memories and current conversation:\n\nExplanation: \nResponse 1 reflects a general encouragement and support from the Mentor, suggesting to take things one step at a time. While it's supportive, it doesn't explicitly recall any specific past memories or experiences shared between the Mentor and Mentee. \n\nResponse 2, on the other hand, ties into the past memories and the current conversation by specifically referencing the importance of maintaining connections with old friends. This aligns with the Mentee's expressed intent to keep in touch and echoes the supportive role the Mentor has played in the past, particularly when the Mentee had to weigh options and make decisions, such as taking responsibility for their actions and their career decisions.\n\nChoice: 2"
