You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers B: I understand that you were struggling with your feelings, but it's important to always consider how your actions might impact others.

    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 2 directly recalls a past memory of Co-worker A borrowing Co-worker B's pencil without asking and feeling guilty about it. By drawing a parallel between that memory and the current situation, it not only highlights the importance of respecting others' choices and feelings but also references a specific past incident related to Co-worker A. This makes Response 2 more memorable as it connects the conversation to a past shared experience.\n\nChoice: 2"
