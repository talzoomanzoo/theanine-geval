    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nCo-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument.\nCo-worker B is supportive and interested in the evidence collected by Co-worker A.\nCo-worker A's evidence includes statistics and personal accounts from clients.\nCo-worker A believes their evidence is more compelling than the opposing side's evidence.\nCo-worker A plans to present the evidence clearly and persuasively in court.\nCo-worker A appreciates the support and hard work put into the case.\nCo-worker A tends to defend themselves physically when feeling attacked.\nCo-worker B believes that physical altercations are not the answer to conflicts.\nCo-worker A is perceived as dangerous by others due to their behavior in conflicts.\nCo-worker A has presented evidence in front of a judge to support their position in the past.\nCo-worker B commends Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs.\nCo-worker A convinced Karen to give them money for car repairs.\nThe car has been in the shop for a week.\nCo-worker A has a reputation for looking for fights.\nCo-worker B mentions that Co-worker A's reputation may have influenced Karen's hesitation to give them money.\nCo-worker A denies that their reputation had any impact on Karen giving them the money.\nCo-worker A agrees to be more conscious of how they come across to others in the future.\nCo-worker A is a skilled builder who recently completed building a house for Co-worker B.\nCo-worker B is happy with the house built by Co-worker A and is considering adding a deck to the house.\nCo-worker A is willing to take on the project of building a deck for Co-worker B.\nCo-worker A has experience dealing with challenging clients and emphasizes the importance of communication and setting expectations.\nCo-worker A recommends a landscaping company to Co-worker B based on a positive past experience working with them.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message.\nCo-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of skills, you always present a compelling argument in debates. I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive.\nCo-workers A: Yes, I think it's important to back up your claims with facts and figures. It helps to convince the judge or the audience that you're right.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of convincing people, have you ever been in a physical altercation before?\nCo-workers A: Yes, unfortunately. But that doesn't mean I'm a danger to people. I just don't back down from a fight when I'm standing up for what's right.\nCo-workers B: That's understandable. Speaking of standing up for what's right, do you remember when you asked Karen for money and she was hesitant at first? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers A: Yes, I recall that. It took some convincing, but she eventually saw the value in supporting the cause.\nRESPONSE 2\nCo-workers A: I remember that conversation. Karen was hesitant to give me money for car repairs due to trust issues. It's important to be mindful of how we come across to others, as it can impact how people perceive and trust us.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 2 demonstrates a higher degree of memorability because it not only recalls the past event related to the conversation with Karen, but also incorporates context from the past memories. It references the reason for Karen's hesitation, which was discussed in the past memories, and acknowledges the importance of perception and trust, which was also a topic Co-worker A agreed to be more conscious about. Response 1, on the other hand, is more general and does not reflect specific past details, making Response 2 better at reflecting past memories.\n\nChoice: 2"
