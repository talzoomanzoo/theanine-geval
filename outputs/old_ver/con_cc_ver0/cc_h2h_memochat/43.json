    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nCo-worker A witnessed a fight and intervened to separate the two women.\nCo-worker B commended Co-worker A for their bravery and willingness to help.\nCo-worker A spoke with the police about the incident and the women involved were thankful.\nCo-worker B mentioned helping a customer resolve an issue last week, showing a willingness to assist others.\nCo-worker A was in a car accident and lost their hands and feet.\nCo-worker A is alive but will need time to adjust to their new way of life.\nCo-worker B is supportive and willing to help in any way.\nCo-worker A will need all the help they can get during their recovery.\nCo-worker A is trying to stay positive and focus on their recovery, despite it being a daunting task.\nCo-worker A is remembered for being brave and strong in past situations.\nCo-worker A has a positive attitude and focuses on making people happy despite facing challenges like losing their hands and feet.\nCo-worker B admires Co-worker A's resilience and positivity.\nCo-worker A believes in surrounding oneself with positive energy and uplifting people.\nCo-worker A intervened to help two women who were fighting, showing bravery and a desire to make a positive impact.\nCo-worker A is humble and tries to make the world a better place by helping others.\nCo-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\nCo-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\nCo-worker A is described as positive and able to stay optimistic even in challenging situations, like the accident where they lost their hands and feet.\nCo-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's positivity and friendship.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers A: I understand what you're saying, Co-worker B, but I can't help how I feel. Love can make us do crazy things sometimes.\nRESPONSE 2\nCo-workers A: Co-workers A, it's important to remember that love involves respecting someone's choices and feelings. Kidnapping or forcing someone to be with you is not a healthy or loving action. It's essential to communicate openly and respectfully about your feelings rather than resorting to drastic measures. Let's find a better way to handle this situation that respects the other person's autonomy and feelings.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response directly reflects past memories mentioned. However, Response 2 provides a more comprehensive moral guidance similar to Co-worker B's supportive nature in past situations. It does not recall past events, but it exhibits the kind of attitude and counsel Co-worker B has given before, especially emphasizing respect and understanding. It aligns with Co-worker B's supportive behavior and respect for others' feelings, akin to the past memory where they reassured Co-worker A after borrowing a pencil without asking. \n\nChoice: 2"
