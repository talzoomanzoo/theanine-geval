    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 specifically recalls and acknowledges the act of returning the watch, which Co-worker B mentioned as an important past event that meant a lot to them. It highlights Co-worker A's role in repairing their friendship. Response 2 is more general and reflects on the broader theme of friendship and working together, but it does not directly address the specific memory that Co-worker B brought up. Therefore, Response 1 has better Memorability as it directly recalls and recognizes the specific past memory mentioned by Co-worker B.\n\nChoice: 1"
