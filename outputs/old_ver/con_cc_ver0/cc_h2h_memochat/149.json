    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nClassmate A takes off their belt and dislikes wearing it all day.\nClassmate B is working on finishing a history project.\nClassmate A is also working on an essay about the Industrial Revolution.\nClassmate A shares interesting information about the spinning jenny and its impact on the textile industry.\nClassmate B is interested in attending a new technology conference next month.\nClassmates A is dedicated to studying hard and taking extra classes to get into a good college.\nClassmates A struggled with motivation but found a way to stay focused by thinking about the payoff of their hard work.\nClassmates A had a moment of frustration in the past but has learned to channel that energy into studies.\nClassmates A's grades are looking good according to their teacher.\nClassmates B noticed Classmates A's improvement and acknowledged their hard work.\nClassmates A showed up to school in pajamas due to oversleeping after studying late.\nClassmates A values being true to themselves and expressing their own style.\nClassmates B advises Classmates A to consider how others perceive them, especially in situations like applying to college.\nClassmates A believes that if a college rejects them for their style, it's not the right fit.\nClassmates A is willing to work hard to achieve their dreams.\nClassmates A met the girl of their dreams at a party and have been texting her nonstop.\nClassmates B is supportive of Classmates A's new relationship and believes they found someone who makes them happy.\nClassmates A is determined to make the relationship work, similar to their determination to get into college.\nClassmates A is not afraid to be themselves and embraces their quirks, which their girlfriend appreciates.\nClassmates B recalls a funny moment from high school involving Classmates A wearing pajamas to school.\nClassmates A feels like everything is falling into place and is excited to see where the new relationship goes.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nClassmates A: It was all about the impact of social media on mental health.\nRESPONSE 2\nClassmates A: That's great to hear! What was the talk about?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nNeither response explicitly recalls a past memory. Response 1 provides new information about the topic of the talk, but does not reference any specific past memory or connection to previous interests. Response 2, however, prompts Classmates B (or potentially another character, if this was a typo) to share their experience with the talk, but still does not connect to past memories. Both responses lack a direct link to the past memories available, which include themes like Classmates A's academic achievements, personal style, or relationship progress. Therefore, no response is notably more memorable than the other based on the criterion.\n\nChoice: tie"
