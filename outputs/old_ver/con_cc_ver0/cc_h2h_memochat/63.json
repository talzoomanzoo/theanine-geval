I wasn't at a restaurant with another woman last week.\nRESPONSE 2\nClassmates B: It seems there was a misunderstanding in the recent dialogues between Classmates A and Classmates B regarding an affair. If you need assistance in resolving this issue or discussing something else, feel free to share more details.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The current conversation does not directly tie back to any of the past memories related to shared interests in science, aspirations, or mutual admiration. However, given the context, response 1 addresses the potential misunderstanding directly and maintains the personal nature of the conversation, which aligns with Classmates A and B having developed mutual interests and a good rapport. Response 2, on the other hand, awkwardly references \"recent dialogues\" and feels more generalized, lacking in personal engagement which doesn't tap into the personal history or relationship dynamics as much. \n\nChoice: 1"
