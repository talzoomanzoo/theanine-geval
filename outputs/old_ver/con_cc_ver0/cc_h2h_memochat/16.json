Remember, it's also important to keep in touch with your old friends. Scheduling video calls or planning a visit back home can help you feel connected and supported during this transition period.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses reflect some memorability by touching on past discussions, particularly the advice given to the Mentee about staying connected with old friends. However, Response 1 demonstrates a more personalized acknowledgment of the Mentor's past support and guidance, similar to how the mentee has expressed gratitude in previous memories. This mirrors the Mentee's past expressions of appreciation for the Mentor's support, such as when they were guided through the decision-making process or advised regarding their overwhelming situations. Response 2, while still relevant to their past conversations, reiterates a point about staying connected without explicit gratitude or acknowledgment of the Mentor's help in a new city, reducing the impact of memorability compared to Response 1.\n\nChoice: 1"
