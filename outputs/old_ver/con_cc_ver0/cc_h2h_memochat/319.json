    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 2 reflects past memories related to Co-worker A's efforts to be more responsible and reliable, which is noted as part of their character and recent improvements in punctuality. Co-worker B uses this opportunity to encourage these positive behaviors by emphasizing the importance of maintaining responsibility and reliabilityâ€”a subject previously noted as a focus in their interactions. Therefore, Response 2 has a higher memorability factor than Response 1 as it connects the current situation with past efforts and improvements of Co-worker A.\n\nChoice: 2"
