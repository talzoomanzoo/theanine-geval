    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nNeighbors A surprised Neighbors B with a pizza.\nNeighbors A ordered a large cheese pizza with extra sauce for Neighbors B.\nNeighbors A did this as a gesture of appreciation for Neighbors B's actions in the neighborhood.\nNeighbors B had tried the new restaurant down the street and found the food good but the service slow.\nNeighbors A ordered pizza for Neighbors B in the past.\nNeighbors A has developed romantic feelings for Neighbors B.\nNeighbors B values their friendship with Neighbors A.\nNeighbors A is willing to take things slow in their relationship with Neighbors B.\nBoth Neighbors A and B appreciate their friendship and are open to going back to being friends if the romantic relationship doesn't work out.\nNeighbor A recently discovered a park on Main Street with a playground and water park area.\nNeighbor A went to the park with their son, who had a great time.\nNeighbor A's daughter recently started high school, which has been a big adjustment for the family.\nNeighbor B has a son who also started high school and understands the challenges and excitement that come with it.\nBoth neighbors enjoy discovering new things in their neighborhood and spending time with their children.\nNeighbor A feels knowledgeable and like they understand everything, specifically about the history of their town.\nNeighbor B appreciates Neighbor A's thoughtfulness, mentioning a pizza Neighbor A ordered for them.\nNeighbor A is embarrassed about a past incident where they pushed Neighbor B's shoulder to gain acceptance.\nNeighbor A and Neighbor B found a park together a couple of years ago and enjoyed playing frisbee and having a picnic.\nNeighbor A reminisces about simpler times and expresses missing them.\nNeighbor B reassures Neighbor A about past embarrassing incidents and emphasizes their current friendship.\nBoth neighbors look forward to new adventures and discoveries in the future, appreciating the surprises and possibilities life offers.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nNeighbors A: I just tried this breathing exercise and it really helped me relax.\nNeighbors B: What kind of breathing exercise?\nNeighbors A: It's just a simple one, where you inhale for four seconds, hold your breath for seven seconds, and then exhale for eight seconds. I've been doing it every day for the past week and it's made such a difference.\nNeighbors B: That's really interesting. I've heard that breathing exercises can be really helpful for reducing stress and anxiety.\nNeighbors A: Yes, it definitely has helped me with that. Plus, it's something that I can easily do anywhere, whether I'm at home or out running errands.\nNeighbors B: That's great. It's always good to have a simple tool like that to help manage stress. \nNeighbors A: Speaking of managing stress, remember a few years ago when I pushed your shoulder because I wanted you to accept me?\nNeighbors B: Oh yeah, I do remember that. That was a stressful time for both of us.\nNeighbors A: It definitely was. But I'm so glad that we've been able to move past that and have a good neighborly relationship now. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nNeighbors B: I'm grateful for that too. It's nice to have a supportive neighbor like you.\nRESPONSE 2\nNeighbors B: That's great to hear! It's wonderful that we've been able to overcome past challenges and build a strong neighborly relationship. It shows how much we've grown and developed over time.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 1 acknowledges the current supportive nature of their relationship but does not specifically reference past memories beyond their current neighborly dynamics. Response 2, on the other hand, explicitly acknowledges overcoming past challenges and building a strong relationship, which strongly ties back to their past of dealing with stress and an embarrassing incident. This reflection on how they have grown and developed over time as neighbors emphasizes the theme of overcoming past difficulties and aligns more with the memorability criterion by recalling and valuing their shared history.\n\nChoice: 2"
