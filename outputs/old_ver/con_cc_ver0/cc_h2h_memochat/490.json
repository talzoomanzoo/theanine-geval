    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response directly references past memories. However, Response 2 hints at Classmates A's willingness to help a friend, which is a recurring theme in their friendship as seen in past memories where Classmates A and B help each other with schoolwork. Though this is a subtle reflection, it is slightly more memorable than Response 1, which doesn't connect to any past event. Response 2 provides a broader context about Classmates A's supportive nature, which aligns more with the overall dynamic of their past interactions mentioned in the memories.\n\nChoice: 2"
