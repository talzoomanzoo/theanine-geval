Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nMentee is feeling sleepy and struggling to get enough sleep due to staying up late watching TV or using social media.\nMentor advises Mentee to listen to their body, set a bedtime, and create a relaxing routine before sleep.\nMentor emphasizes the importance of getting enough sleep for physical and mental well-being.\nMentee agrees to try the advice and express gratitude towards Mentor.\nMentee is currently living in an abusive and controlling cult.\nMentor also wants to escape the oppressive rules of the cult.\nMentee has found a shelter for people who have been in abusive cults and is planning to escape there.\nMentor advises caution and careful planning to avoid raising suspicion from the cult.\nBoth Mentee and Mentor agree to pack their things and get ready to leave without letting anyone know.\nMentor suggests waiting for the right moment to leave to ensure a smooth escape.\nMentee expresses feeling suffocated and eager to leave the cult.\nMentee wants to teach religion to help people find meaning in their lives.\nMentor warns Mentee to be careful not to be preachy or judgmental while teaching religion.\nMentee agrees to teach in a way that allows people to make their own decisions about their beliefs.\nMentee is doing research on different religions and plans to speak with religious leaders for guidance.\nMentor suggests Mentee volunteer at a local church or religious organization to gain experience.\nMentee is taking the idea of teaching religion seriously and wants to make a positive impact on people's lives.\nMentor encourages Mentee to approach teaching religion with an open mind and heart.\nMentor is from Italy and has lived in the United States.\nMentor was born and raised in a restrictive religious community.\nMentor became a mentor to help others going through similar situations.\nMentee has been thinking about helping others who may be in abusive cults.\nMentor and Mentee have discussed escaping an abusive cult in the past.\nMentor believes teaching religion or spiritual beliefs can help people feel connected and live by values.\nMentee wants to make a positive impact in people's lives and is grateful for Mentor's support.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nMentee: Mentor, have you ever tried to imagine what it would be like to think like someone else?\nMentor: Yes, I have. It's a great way to better understand and empathize with others.\nMentee: That's exactly what I thought. I've been trying to imagine what personY is thinking lately. It's been helping me to understand their perspective a bit better. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nMentor: That's a great exercise in building empathy and understanding. Putting yourself in someone else's shoes can really open your eyes to different viewpoints.\nRESPONSE 2\nMentor: It's wonderful that you're taking the time to empathize with personY and understand their perspective. Putting yourself in someone else's shoes can lead to deeper connections and better communication. Is there anything specific you'd like advice or guidance on regarding this situation with personY?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses acknowledge the idea of empathy and understanding others' perspectives, which resonate with past memories of considering others' viewpoints (e.g., the importance of approaching religion with an open mind and heart). However, Response 2 builds on this by adding a line that offers the mentee further guidance on their specific situation, which parallels the past memories where the mentor often provided advice and guidance (e.g., careful planning to escape the cult, warnings about being preachy). Response 2 also aligns with the mentor's past role as someone who helps by advising on personal development endeavors. Therefore, Response 2 better reflects past memories by incorporating the mentor's trait of offering proactive guidance.\n\nChoice: 2"
