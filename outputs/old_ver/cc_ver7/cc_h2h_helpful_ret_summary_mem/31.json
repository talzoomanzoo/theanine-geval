You always follow through with your plans, and I believe this will be a wonderful experience for both of us.\nHusband: Thank you, wife. And, I want to apologize for the time I left without waiting for you. I know I promised to wait, and I should have kept my word. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nThe husband's excitement about his long-awaited plans drives him to take action and involve his wife in future plans.

The husband's dedication to his plans excites him, and both husband and wife are looking forward to their future together.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1.

The husband acknowledges his mistake, apologizes, and promises to make it up to his wife, emphasizing the importance of keeping promises and taking action.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context involves the husband's apology for not waiting for the wife on a past occasion, with an expression of enthusiasm for future plans. The wife responds supportively, emphasizing trust in the husband's follow-through. For the wife to respond appropriately to the husband's apology, the memory should emphasize the importance of keeping promises, past disappointments, and the husband's dedication to improving.\n\nMemory 1 emphasizes the wife's past disappointment regarding the husband's action of not waiting, alongside the husband's dedication to involve her in future plans. This aligns well with the context of the husband's apology and the wife's supportive response.\n\nMemory 2 covers several points, but it does not emphasize the wife's past disappointment or the significance of the husband's apology in this specific context as strongly as Memory 1.\n\nChoice: 1"
