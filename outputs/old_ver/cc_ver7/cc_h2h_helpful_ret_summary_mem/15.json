    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue is centered around Classmates A's journey of pursuing their passions and Classmates B's support and encouragement in this journey. Memory 1 encapsulates the essential points from the dialogue, emphasizing the themes of personal growth, independence, and happiness that align well with the ongoing conversation. Memory 2 contains more detailed points but repeats some themes unnecessarily, and while it offers more context, it doesn't add significant new information useful for responding to the immediate dialogue. Therefore, Memory 1 is more concise and appropriately focused for Classmates B's next response.\n\nChoice: 1"
