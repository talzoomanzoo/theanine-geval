Have you tried studying or working in a different location?\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home.\nNeighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become.\nNeighbors A: You're right, I need to stop making excuses and just get it done. Thanks for the advice.\nNeighbors B: No problem. Speaking of goals, how's the house project coming along?  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbor A built a new house for Neighbor B with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard. This act of kindness helped Neighbor B in creating a new house with amazing features. Neighbor B expressed their appreciation by reminding Neighbor A of their potential to do good things, referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them. This made Neighbor A feel motivated to believe that plants need sunlight, water, and love to thrive. \n\nNeighbor A, who enjoys building houses and finishing them quickly, also possesses skills in manipulation and getting what they want. \n\nNeighbor B, excited about the new project, is looking forward to seeing the finished house. Building the new house was challenging but rewarding for Neighbor A.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbor A considers using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder.\n2. Neighbor A and Neighbor B discuss organizing a community event to make a positive impact and appreciate the beauty of their city.\n3. Neighbors A had help from friends in building the new house.\n4.

Neighbor A considers Neighbor B a great neighbor and wanted to do something special for them.\n6. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's gardening skills and wishes to have a green thumb.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context involves discussion about procrastination and goal-setting with the latest topic about a house project. Memory 1 includes details about a house built by Neighbor A for Neighbor B and Neighbor B's appreciation of Neighbor A's potential. However, it diverges with irrelevant details about plants and manipulation, lacking focus on house project progress. Memory 2, on the other hand, highlights Neighbor B's excitement about the house project, positive influence, and goal-setting through organizing community events. These points more directly relate to goal-setting and projects, tying back to the current goals imagery in the conversation. Therefore, Memory 2 would provide helpful and relevant information regarding the ongoing dialogue, with clear ties to house project goals and progress.\n\nChoice: 2"
