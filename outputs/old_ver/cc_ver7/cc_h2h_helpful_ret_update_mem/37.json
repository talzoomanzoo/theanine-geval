    "prediction": "Explanation: In the given dialogue context, Classmate A is expressing romantic feelings towards Classmate B and is concerned about potentially losing Clasate B's friendship. The Memory that would be most helpful for Classmate B to respond appropriately should include information on the trust and closeness in their relationship, as well as any past supportive interactions, which could provide reassurance to Classmate A that their friendship is strong.\n\nMEMORY 1 consists of a mixed set of recollections, including issues of trust and unrelated tasks, such as a group project. It mentions support and stress relief, but the context surrounding these actions is ambiguous, and there is no focus on their existing trust or depth of relationship. This could confuse the response in terms of what specifically to address in Classmate A's concerns.\n\nMEMORY 2, on the other hand, highlights key points such as admiration of Classmate B's courage, the relief in having someone to confide in, established trust, and past helpful interactions. These elements relate directly to the concerns of vulnerability and friendship loss present in the dialogue context and provide a reassuring foundation for Classmate B's response.\n\nChoice: 2"
