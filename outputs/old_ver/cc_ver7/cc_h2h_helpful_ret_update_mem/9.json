    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains information more focused on Classmate A's aspirations beyond carpentry, such as singing and appreciation for effective leadership. However, these do not directly address Classmate B's inquiry about how Classmate A got into carpentry. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, provides diverse points about Classmates A and B's relationship, support for each other's ventures, and aspirations, but similarly lacks specific information related to carpentry. Both memories lack direct relevance to the specific question in the dialogue context. However, MEMORY 2 at least mentions Classmate B's support and possible collaboration with A, which could guide the context of how A got into carpentry as a mutual interest or support.\n\nChoice: 2"
