I was promoted to product manager!\nCo-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge.\nCo-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail.\nCo-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of new products, remember when you used to fantasize about being a great leader?\nCo-workers A: Ha, yeah. That seems like ages ago.\nCo-workers B: Well, now you can finally take on that leadership role and make your dreams a reality.\nCo-workers A: That's true. It's amazing how life works out sometimes. But it hasn't always been smooth sailing. Remember when I was really stressed about you not liking me? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. [Co-worker A used to fantasize about being a great leader and being respected and admired.] - (SameTopic) - [Co-worker A has aspirations of being a great leader and emphasizes the importance of communication.]\n2. [Co-worker A has fantasies of being a great leader.] - (SameTopic) - [Co-worker A felt stressed about their relationship with Co-worker B in the past.] - (Causes) - [Co-worker B advises Co-worker A to control their emotions and discuss the issue with Co-worker B.]\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker A used to fantasize about being a great leader and being respected and admired.\n2. Co-worker A has fantasies of being a great leader.\n3. Co-worker A has grown and become more confident over the years.\n4. Co-worker A considers taking on more responsibility at work as a start towards being a leader.\n5. Co-worker A has aspirations of being a great leader and emphasizes the importance of communication.\n6. Co-worker B acknowledges and supports Co-worker A's growth and progress.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context revolves around Co-worker A's promotion and their past concerns about their relationship with Co-worker B. MEMORY 1 includes information about Co-worker A's past stress and Co-worker B's advice, which directly relates to Co-worker A's recollection of being stressed about Co-worker B not liking them. This makes MEMORY 1 more contextually relevant and helpful for Co-worker B to respond to the last utterance. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 contains general information about Co-worker A's growth, leadership aspirations, and support from Co-worker B, but it lacks the specific context of the past stress about the relationship, which is crucial for a more relevant response.\n\nChoice: 1"
