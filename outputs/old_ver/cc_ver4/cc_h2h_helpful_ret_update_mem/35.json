    "prediction": "Explanation: The Dialogue Context revolves around the Mentee and Mentor discussing open-mindedness, understanding different perspectives, and cultural awareness. MEMORY 2 provides a more general background about the Mentee's and Mentor's aspirations and values, which align more with the current conversation's themes of understanding and compassion. On the other hand, MEMORY 1 has a more specific focus on the notion of breaking free from oppressive structures which is largely unrelated to the ongoing discussion in the dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 2"
