    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Classmates A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I need to talk to you about something important.\nClassmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\nClassmates A: I know about your affair with that other woman.\nClassmates B: What are you talking about? I don't have an affair with anyone.\nClassmates A: Don't lie to me! I saw you together at the restaurant last week.\nClassmates B: That was just a business meeting. We were discussing a potential collaboration on a music project.\nClassmates A: I don't believe you. You're just trying to cover it up. I'm going to tell everyone and ruin your career.\nClassmates B: Why are you doing this? I thought we were friends. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nClassmates A, who is passionate about science and interested in becoming a doctor or researcher to help people, has developed a crush on Classmates B, finding their interest in taking biology classes in college flattering.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 contains information that directly relates to the relationship dynamic between Classmates A and B, which is relevant to the current situation where there's a conflict emerging despite the mention that they have a good relationship. It provides context that they are interested in spending more time together, and they have a mutual admiration for each other, which is counter to the current conflict and can be useful for Classmate B to respond. MEMORY 1, while showing admiration and shared interests, does not provide the context about their personal relationship development like MEMORY 2 does.\n\nChoice: 2"
