Did you get sunburned?\nClassmates B: No, I didn't get sunburned. I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed.\nClassmates A: Embarrassed? Why?\nClassmates B: It's nothing, really. Just something embarrassing happened to me earlier.\nClassmates A: Come on, tell me! I won't judge you, I promise.\nClassmates B: Well, I accidentally spilled my lunch all over myself in front of some people.\nClassmates A: (laughs) That's it? That's why you're embarrassed? I thought it was something serious.\nClassmates B: (sighs) Yeah, it's silly. But still embarrassing.\nClassmates A: Don't worry about it. It happens to everyone. Remember the time I tripped and fell in front of the whole class during our presentation?\nClassmates B: Oh yeah, that was pretty bad. But you handled it so well. You just got up, dusted yourself off, and continued with the presentation. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Classmates A praised Classmates B for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.\n2. Classmates B admires Classmates A's attitude and sees it as a good example for others.\n3. Classmate A believes in giving 110% effort in everything they do.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1.

Classmates B also mentioned that Classmates A helped them prepare for a driving test, showing patience and dedication.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains relevant information that Classmates B admires Classmates A's attitude and views it as a good example for others. This can be related to the current conversation where Classmates A recounts a personal embarrassing moment and explains they handled it well. Classmates B's admiration for such traits in Classmates A would fit this context and could lead to a comforting or complimenting response. Meanwhile, MEMORY 2 does not directly relate to the conversation about handling embarrassing situations and support, making it less helpful for the specific dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 1"
