    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides relevant information about Co-worker A's past feelings of stress regarding their relationship with Co-worker B, which directly relates to the last utterance in the dialogue context. This helps Co-worker B respond to Co-worker A's mention of being stressed about their relationship in a meaningful way. MEMORY 2, while providing a broader context on Co-worker A's growth and aspirations, does not include specific information about past relationship stress that would directly assist in responding to the last utterance.\n\nChoice: 1"
