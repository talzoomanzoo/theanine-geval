    "prediction": "Explanation: Given the dialogue context, Classmates A is concerned about how Classmates B found out about their past, implying some level of secrecy or unexpected revelation. Neither MEMORY directly addresses information about Classmates A's past being discovered by Classmates B. However, MEMORY 2 provides slightly more context by mentioning a mysterious woman in a dark alley, which may suggest a scenario related to secrecy or an unexpected encounter that was shared with Classmates B. This gives Classmates B a potential reference point to base their response on, even though it's not directly addressing how they found out about Classmates A's past.\n\nChoice: 2"
