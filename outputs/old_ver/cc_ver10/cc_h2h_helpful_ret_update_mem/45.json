    "prediction": "Explanation: The task is to select which MEMORY provides more relevant and useful information for Classmate A to respond to Classmate B's question about how Classmate A found the camping spot. MEMORY 1 provides context directly related to camping, describing Classmate A's ability to find a perfect camping spot, which would allow Classmate A to directly comment on how they found the spot when asked by Classmate B. Although MEMORY 2 includes information about Classmate A's proactive nature, it does not explicitly relate to camping or finding a spot, making it less directly relevant to the query in the dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 1"
