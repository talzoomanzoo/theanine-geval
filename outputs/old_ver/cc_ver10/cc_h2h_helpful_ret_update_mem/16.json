    "prediction": "Explanation: The last utterance in the dialogue context refers to Co-worker A being stressed about Co-worker B possibly not liking them in the past, making the topic of their relationship relevant here. Memory 1 provides information about Co-worker A previously being stressed about their relationship with Co-worker B and mentions Co-worker B advising Co-worker A, which is highly relevant to the current dialogue context. Memory 2, while containing general relevant information about Co-worker A's growth and leadership aspirations, doesn't specifically address the issue of their past stress about the relationship.\n\nChoice: 1"
