It takes a lot of courage to pursue your passions like that.\nClassmates A: Yeah, it was scary at first, but the response has been really positive. I'm so glad I finally decided to take the leap.\nClassmates B: I'm proud of you. It's always great to see someone following their dreams.\nClassmates A: Thanks, it's been a journey, but I'm really happy with where I am now. It's crazy to think that years ago, I was so hesitant to even share this part of myself.\nClassmates B: It just goes to show that it's never too late to start pursuing what you love. Remember when we talked about you living your life on your own terms? You're doing just that. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nClassmates B encouraged Classmates A to step out of their comfort zone and try new things for personal growth.

    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 provides more relevant and focused information about the current conversation between Classmates A and B. It highlights Classmates A's pursuit of their passions, living life on their own terms, and how that aligns with the encouragement from Classmates B. This memory is directly linked to the dialogue context, which discusses Classmates A's journey to share their passion for the arts and pursue their dreams. \n\nIn contrast, Memory 2 includes a broader range of points that are less specifically tailored to the current dialogue context, making it harder to pinpoint the key theme of Classmates A's courage and life choices that have been validated by Classmates B's previous support.\n\nChoice: 1"
