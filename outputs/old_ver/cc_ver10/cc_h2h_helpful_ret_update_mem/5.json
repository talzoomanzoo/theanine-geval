Memory 2 is helpful because it provides more relevant joint activities (like grabbing lunch and exploring a romantic connection) and relationship dynamics that could have influenced Classmates A's perception and reaction during the conversation. In particular, it shows a prior interest in spending time together, which may contribute to Classmates A's feelings of betrayal and jealousy.\n\nChoice: 2"
