I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. The Mentor has been guiding and supporting the Mentee in their work for years, resulting in the Mentee expressing gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process. This has led to the Mentee feeling overwhelmed with the college application process, similar to how they took shoes from the store without paying because they couldn't afford them.\n\n2.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT suggests that the Mentee is feeling lonely in a new city and missing their old friends, implying they might need emotional support or guidance on building a new social network. MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 both mention the Mentee feeling overwhelmed, being offered and accepting a job in the new city, and expressing gratitude for the Mentor's guidance. However, MEMORY 2 offers additional context about the Mentee feeling overwhelmed with college applications and time pressures with the SAT, which while not directly related to feeling lonely, can compound their stress and need for support. Memory 2 provides reassurance that many students feel similarly when they are overwhelmed, which is more directly applicable to feelings of loneliness and adjustment.\n\nChoice: 2"
