    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context ends with Co-worker B recalling a time when Co-worker A felt frustrated during a project. Memory 2 includes relevant details about Co-worker A feeling remorse and Co-worker B's supportive response, which directly relate to the theme of learning from challenges with support. This is useful and relevant to the current dialogue context, emphasizing the value of a supportive environment. Memory 1 lacks this specific relevance and therefore, Memory 2 is more helpful for responding appropriately.\n\nChoice: 2"
