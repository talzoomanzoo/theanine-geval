Thus, the aspect of memory that pertains to this specific encouragement and support from the wife, as well as any reference to the husband overcoming challenges in the past, would be most helpful. Memory 2 directly mentions the wife remembering the husband's nervousness before a presentation, which aligns well with the context of her encouraging him to step out of his comfort zone, similar to his past experience of overcoming fear.\n\nChoice: 2"
