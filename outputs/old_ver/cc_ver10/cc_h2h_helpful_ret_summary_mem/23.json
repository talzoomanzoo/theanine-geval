This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn.\nTeacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation?\nStudent: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle.\nTeacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time?\nStudent: Really? Maybe I should try to build up my tolerance then.\nTeacher: It could be worth a try. Speaking of trying new things, how's your language studying going?\nStudent: It's going pretty well. I started with French, but now I'm considering taking up Spanish and German too. I want to become more well-rounded.\nTeacher: That's a great goal. Have you thought about any specific ways you could use your language skills?\nStudent: I would love to be able to travel more and speak with the locals in their native language. Maybe I could even teach my grandchildren some basic phrases.\nTeacher: Speaking of your grandchildren, how's your retirement planning going?\nStudent: It's going well. I'm really looking forward to spending more time with them and taking them on fun trips.\nTeacher: That sounds like a great plan. Speaking of fun, remember when you scared me in the hallway a few days ago? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nThe student had a heroic experience at the beach where they helped save a young kid from drowning. This event has made the student eager to retire and spend quality time with their grandchildren. Additionally, the student is currently studying French at college and intends to learn Spanish and German to become more well-rounded in language skills.\n\nThe teacher praised the student for their bravery and quick action in the emergency situation. This positive reinforcement may have contributed to the student feeling stressed lately, which could have led to the outburst. Furthermore, the student is excited about retiring and spending time with their grandkids, already planning fun activities.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. The student expresses excitement about retiring and spending time with their grandkids, already planning fun activities.\n2. The student is studying French at college and plans on learning Spanish and German as well.\n3. The teacher speaks Spanish and French fluently.\n4. The teacher encourages the student's retirement plans, highlighting the importance of focusing on family during retirement.\n5. The student has already made plans with their daughter and son-in-law to visit more often and take the grandkids on trips.\n6. The student felt rewarded by the experience and emphasized the importance of being aware of surroundings and acting quickly in emergencies.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context ends with the teacher addressing a memory of the student scaring them in the hallway. Specific details about heroism or language studies are not directly relevant to this topic. However, the transition from language learning and retirement planning to reminiscing about a recent shared experience (scaring in the hallway) is more personal and immediate.\n\nMemory 1 includes an anecdote about the student saving a child, which doesn't align with the topic of scaring the teacher. Memory 2, while still not very relevant to the last part of the dialogue, lacks the unrelated heroism detail but still doesn't address the immediate topic. \n\nChoice: tie"
