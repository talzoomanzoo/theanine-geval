    "prediction": "Explanation: When considering helpfulness, it is important to prioritize information that is directly relevant to the Mentee's current focus on living in the moment and their ongoing journey with sobriety. Both MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 contain details about the Mentor's support, the Mentee's dedication to sobriety, their gratitude, and their interest in incorporating yoga for mental and physical health benefits. However, MEMORY 1 clearly connects these aspects to the current discussion in the dialogue context by emphasizing that Mentee's focus on living in the moment resonates with their sobriety journey and mentioning that the Mentor feels proud of Mentee's growth. MEMORY 2, while it mentions similar points, does not explicitly tie them together as effectively in relation to the final point in the dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 1"
