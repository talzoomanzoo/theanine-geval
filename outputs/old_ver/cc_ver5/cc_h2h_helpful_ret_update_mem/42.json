    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is about Classmates A asking Classmates B how they found out something about their past that Classmates A had not told anyone. In this context, knowing more about the past interactions or connections between the two classmates would be more relevant than general advice about buses or caution regarding dark alleys. Memory 1 contains information about their friendship dynamics and Classmates A's openness to new experiences, which could relate to how Classmates B might have found out something about Classmates A's past. However, Memory 2 provides a more direct mention of Classmates A being curious and exploring new things, which could explain how Classmates B learned about the past incidentally during such explorations.\n\nChoice: 2"
