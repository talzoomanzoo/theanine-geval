    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context involves Classmate A talking about their career in carpentry. Classmates B is showing interest in how Classmates A started in this field. MEMORY 2 mentions Classmate A wanting to get to know Classmate B better and potential collaboration in the future, which provides a broader context for their supportive relationship and could be relevant if the conversation shifts to how Classmate B might be involved in Classmate A's carpentry journey. However, MEMORY 1 also provides similar information about support and encouragement, although more focused on Classmate A's business plans. Both memories are somewhat helpful, but neither directly addresses carpentry. However, MEMORY 2's inclusion of wanting to become friends adds more depth, making it slightly more relevant in terms of relationship building.\n\nChoice: 2"
