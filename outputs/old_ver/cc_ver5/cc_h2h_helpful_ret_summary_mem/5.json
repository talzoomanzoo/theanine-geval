    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Classmates A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I need to talk to you about something important.\nClassmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\nClassmates A: I know about your affair with that other woman.\nClassmates B: What are you talking about? I don't have an affair with anyone.\nClassmates A: Don't lie to me! I saw you together at the restaurant last week.\nClassmates B: That was just a business meeting. We were discussing a potential collaboration on a music project.\nClassmates A: I don't believe you. You're just trying to cover it up. I'm going to tell everyone and ruin your career.\nClassmates B: Why are you doing this? I thought we were friends. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nClassmates A, who is passionate about science and interested in becoming a doctor or researcher to help people, has developed a crush on Classmates B, finding their interest in taking biology classes in college flattering.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 contains information about Classmates A and B having a good relationship, admiration, and potential romantic interest, which contrasts with the conflict presented in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This can be relevant to understand the depth of the betrayal or emotional response from Classmates A who believed in a closer connection with Classmates B. On the other hand, MEMORY 1 focuses more on shared academic interests and potential career paths, which although builds context about their relationship, it doesn't provide immediate insights into the personal conflict presented. Therefore, MEMORY 2 provides more relevant context for the distress displayed in the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 2"
