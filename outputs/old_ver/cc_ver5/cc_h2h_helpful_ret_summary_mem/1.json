    "prediction": "Explanation: Given the dialogue context, where the Mentee expresses feelings of loneliness in a new city, the most helpful memory should ideally provide insights related to emotional support, adaptation to a new environment, or relevant past experiences that could provide comfort or guidance. Both memories contain elements pertaining to the menteeâ€™s city move, job acceptance, and emotional challenges such as feeling overwhelmed. However, MEMORY 1 provides specific details about the mentee's decision to take a job in the city and offers explicit reassurance, indicating support in phases of feeling similar emotional struggles. This would be more directly helpful in addressing the current feelings of loneliness.\n\nChoice: 1"
