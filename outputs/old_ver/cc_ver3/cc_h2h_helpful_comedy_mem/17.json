    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just tried this breathing exercise and it really helped me relax.\nNeighbors B: What kind of breathing exercise?\nNeighbors A: It's just a simple one, where you inhale for four seconds, hold your breath for seven seconds, and then exhale for eight seconds. I've been doing it every day for the past week and it's made such a difference.\nNeighbors B: That's really interesting. I've heard that breathing exercises can be really helpful for reducing stress and anxiety.\nNeighbors A: Yes, it definitely has helped me with that. Plus, it's something that I can easily do anywhere, whether I'm at home or out running errands.\nNeighbors B: That's great. It's always good to have a simple tool like that to help manage stress. \nNeighbors A: Speaking of managing stress, remember a few years ago when I pushed your shoulder because I wanted you to accept me?\nNeighbors B: Oh yeah, I do remember that. That was a stressful time for both of us.\nNeighbors A: It definitely was. But I'm so glad that we've been able to move past that and have a good neighborly relationship now.\nNeighbors B: Me too. And remember when you found that great park a few years ago? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbors A showed appreciation for Neighbors B's actions in the neighborhood, leading to Neighbors A being willing to take things slow in their relationship with Neighbors B. This resulted in Neighbors B reassuring Neighbor A about past embarrassing incidents and emphasizing their current friendship. \nNeighbors A ordered a large cheese pizza with extra sauce for Neighbors B, highlighting the value of their friendship. This conversation transitioned to Neighbor A's daughter starting high school, which has been a significant adjustment for the family.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description: Neighbors B is a friendly individual who enjoys spending time in the neighborhood. They have a son who recently started high school and are glad that Neighbors A and her son had a fun time at the park. Neighbors B appreciates the thoughtful gestures from Neighbors A, like when they ordered a large cheese pizza with extra sauce for them.\n\nRelationship Description: Neighbors A and Neighbors B have a close friendship, as evidenced by the shared experiences and gestures of appreciation between them. Neighbors A wanted to show appreciation for everything Neighbors B does in the neighborhood, and Neighbors B thanked Neighbors A for the thoughtful gesture.\n\nEvent Description: Neighbors A brought Neighbors B a large cheese pizza with extra sauce to show appreciation, and they decided to eat together. They also discussed new adventures and discoveries in the future and enjoyed the ride of life together. Neighbors A and Neighbors B found a park a couple of years ago, played frisbee, and had a picnic, reminiscing about the simpler days.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 both mention the gesture of appreciation from Neighbors A to Neighbors B and their friendship, which is relevant to their current positive relationship despite past stresses mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, MEMORY 2 specifically refers to the park, a direct reference that ties back to Neighbors B's last utterance about remembering when they found a great park a few years ago. This makes MEMORY 2 slightly more relevant and useful in enabling a response in context.\n\nChoice: 2"
