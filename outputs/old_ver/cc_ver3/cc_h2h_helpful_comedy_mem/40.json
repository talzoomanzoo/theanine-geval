    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is about Classmate A finishing a computer course and then discussing specific software recommendations. The most relevant memory would provide details about their shared experiences, particularly regarding help with choosing the right software or similar scenarios. \n\nMEMORY 2 focuses on the supportive nature of their friendship, including academic-related support, which aligns with the conversation about recommending software. Classmate A helping Classmate B with homework suggests a context where software recommendations could naturally occur. Although the specific topic of computer software wasn't mentioned in MEMORY 2, the mutual academic support theme is quite relevant.\n\nMEMORY 1, on the other hand, focuses more on personal growth, responsibility, and past experiences like dancing, which do not directly relate to the software recommendation request in the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 2"
