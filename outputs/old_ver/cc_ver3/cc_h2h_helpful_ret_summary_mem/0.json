It's an important skill to have in life.\nChild: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you.\nParent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you.\nChild: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations, which causes them to mention making mistakes in the past and trying to turn their life around.\n- The Parent and Child plan to watch the sunrise together in the future, and the parent suggests repeating the sunrise-watching tradition on a future weekend.\n- The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring and is supportive and proud of their parent for making changes, offering help and reassurance if needed.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations.\n2. The child is supportive and caring towards the parent.\n3. The child offers help and reassurance to the parent.\n4. Both the parent and child express love and support for each other.\n5. The child is supportive and proud of their parent for making changes.\n6. The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The Child's question about the Parent's experience in detention suggests they are seeking to understand the Parent's past feelings of not being heard. MEMORY 1 includes information about the Parent's past mistakes, their efforts to turn their life around, and the Child's supportive and proud attitude towards the Parent's changes. This is directly relevant to the Child's question and can inform a more emotionally resonant and encouraging response from the Parent. MEMORY 2 contains more general information about the mutual support between the Parent and Child, but doesn't specifically address the context of the Child's question about feeling unheard during tough times.\n\nChoice: 1"
