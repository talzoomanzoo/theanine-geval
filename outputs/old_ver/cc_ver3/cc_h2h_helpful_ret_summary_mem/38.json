    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just got back from my trip to South America. It was amazing!\nNeighbors B: Oh really? Where did you go?\nNeighbors A: I visited Brazil and Peru. The culture and food were incredible.\nNeighbors B: That sounds awesome. I've always wanted to go to Peru to see Machu Picchu.\nNeighbors A: Yes, Machu Picchu is amazing. The view from the top is breathtaking.\nNeighbors B: Have you thought about where you want to go next? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbors A taught the kid the special move to help them feel better, and Neighbors B agreed to buy candy for the neighborhood kids to spread happiness. Neighbors B then admired Neighbors A's organization skills and expressed a desire to enhance their own organization. In response, Neighbor A showed willingness to take precautions and make smart decisions. \n\nNeighbors A won against a kid in chess by using a special move, which led both Neighbors A and B to believe in the value of doing good deeds to strengthen the community. Neighbor B, concerned about safety, cautioned against connecting with strangers. \n\nBoth Neighbors A and B share a belief in the significance of learning and self-improvement, as well as the importance of performing acts of kindness to foster unity. Neighbor B recommended alternative ways to manage stress and emphasized the importance of Neighbor A's well-being.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's organization skills and wishes to improve their own organization.\n2. Neighbors A and B believe in doing nice things for others to bring the community together.\n3. Both Neighbors A and B believe in the importance of learning and self-improvement.\n4. Neighbors A and B both took a cooking class together last year.\n5. Neighbor B suggests finding other ways to relieve frustration and looking out for Neighbor A's well-being.\n6. Neighbor A is feeling frustrated and is considering going to a bar to find someone for a casual encounter.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: In the dialogue context, Neighbors B is asking Neighbors A if they have considered their next travel destination. This calls for a response that is perhaps enthusiastic about travel, future travel plans, or general interests in destinations. Neither memory directly addresses travel plans or interests in destinations, but MEMORY 2 offers some personal insights into the activities Neighbors A has been involved in (like taking a cooking class) which could relate to their interests or plans. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, includes unrelated safety and community-building elements that donâ€™t contribute to the travel-centric dialogue. Therefore, MEMORY 2 is slightly more helpful.\n\nChoice: 2"
