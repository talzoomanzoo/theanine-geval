    "prediction": "Explanation: In the dialogue, Classmates A is facing a crisis after being caught cheating on their taxes and shifts the conversation to their aspiration of becoming a professional basketball player. The helpfulness of the memory will depend on its ability to allow Classmates B to respond relevantly to both the current financial/legal situation and the mention of basketball dreams. MEMORY 1 provides general support information related to the basketball goal and work ethic but does not address A's need for guidance or encouragement specifically in times of doubt. MEMORY 2, however, includes Classmates B's advice to Classmates A about staying focused on goals, the existence of self-doubt, and an instance of tangible support from Classmates B. This allows B to respond with empathy, encouragement, and understanding of A's struggles on multiple fronts.\n\nChoice: 2"
