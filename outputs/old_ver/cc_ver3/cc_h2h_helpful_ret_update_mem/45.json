    "prediction": "Explanation: The current dialogue context is centered around Classmates A showing Classmates B a perfect camping spot they found. Classmates B is curious to know how Classmates A found it, indicating a need to focus on Classmate A's proactive nature and ability to explore and find interesting places. \n\nMemory 1 emphasizes on the camping spot itself - it's level, debris-free, and offers a great view - but it doesn't directly address the question posed by Classmate B about how the spot was found. It does highlight Classmate A's tendency to seek fun and impactful activities, which could imply they have experience in scouting such places but doesn't link directly back to the context.\n\nMemory 2 mentions Classmate A as being proactive and curious, taking the initiative to research topics of interest. This directly aligns with the query about how Classmate A managed to find the campsite, as it suggests they likely researched or explored to find this ideal spot. \n\nTherefore, Memory 2 provides more relevant context to answer the question in the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 2"
