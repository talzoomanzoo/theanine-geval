    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context involves Classmates A asking Classmates B about their knowledge of A's past and how they came to know it. The relevant MEMORY should ideally provide context about secrets or hidden information that Classmates B might have access to. MEMORY 2 contains an entry related to a mysterious encounter Classmates A had, which could potentially align with a past event that Classmates B might know about and is hesitant to disclose. This adds a layer of intrigue that could be relevant to Classmates A's inquiry about the past. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, focuses more on advice, friendship dynamics, and outlooks on life, which seem less relevant to the current topic of past events and secrets.\n\nChoice: 2"
