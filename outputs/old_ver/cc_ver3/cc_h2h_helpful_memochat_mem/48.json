    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides detailed context about the husband's recollection of his fifth-grade presentation, which is directly relevant to the wife's last utterance in the dialogue. The memory elaborates on this experience and the emotional impact it had on the husband, making it more helpful for the husband to connect with the wife's encouragement to embrace challenges and take risks, as he did back then. MEMORY 1 has less concrete relevance to the specific context of trying new writing styles and stepping out of comfort zones.\n\nChoice: 2"
