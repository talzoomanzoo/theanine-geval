    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 2 provides a detailed and relevant past interaction between Classmates A and B, discussing the importance of kindness, support, and acknowledging past misunderstandings. This is directly helpful because it ties back to the ongoing theme of being supportive and making a positive impact, making it highly relevant to the current dialogue context focusing on acts of kindness. Memory 1, on the other hand, contains vague summaries that don't directly connect to the current conversation about helping a neighbor and making a small impact.\n\nChoice: 2"
