    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context revolves around Co-worker A's singing talent and Co-worker B's admiration of their various skills. Memory 1 is more helpful because it specifically highlights Co-worker A's talent and enjoyment for solving mysteries, which aligns with Co-worker B's comment about Co-worker A's surprising skills. Memory 1 provides a relevant background understanding that reinforces Co-worker A's propensity for talent and skill, relevant to the dialogue context. Memory 2, while mentioning Co-worker A's detective-like skills, diverts into a personal story about past job and memories, which is less directly relevant.\n\nChoice: 1"
