I don't have an affair with anyone.\nClassmates A: Don't lie to me! I saw you together at the restaurant last week. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nClassmates B: I think there might be a misunderstanding. I wasn't at a restaurant with another woman last week.\nRESPONSE 2\nClassmates B: I think there might be a misunderstanding. I was actually there with my cousin, not another woman.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses aim to clarify a misunderstanding about a supposed affair, with Response 2 adding specific detail that brings up past memories by addressing the close relationship and open communication between Classmates A and B. However, neither explicitly invokes the shared interest or memories that the two have developed over time, such as their mutual interests in biology, science, or Lady Gaga. Thus, both responses have minimal Memorability through invoking past shared experiences, being more focused on the present misunderstanding.\n\nChoice: tie"
