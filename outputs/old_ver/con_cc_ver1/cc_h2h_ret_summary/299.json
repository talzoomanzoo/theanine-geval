    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nNeighbor A enjoys reading and sharing books with Neighbor B.\nNeighbor B enjoys listening to Neighbor A read and is interested in reading more.\nNeighbor A's favorite book is \"The Great Gatsby.\"\nNeighbor A and Neighbor B went to a concert together in the past and had a great time.\nNeighbors A recently got a new job as a secretary at a small marketing agency.\nNeighbors A aspires to be more important in the company and was promoted to manager after working harder and taking on more responsibility.\nNeighbors B was read to from a book about personal development by Neighbors A, which had a positive impact on Neighbors A's career growth.\nNeighbors A believes in setting goals, developing a positive attitude, and taking action for personal development and career advancement.\nNeighbors B admires Neighbors A's career advancement and expresses interest in borrowing the personal development book.\nNeighbors A has a new workout routine, waking up at 5 a.m\nNeighbors A's workout routine consists of cardio, weightlifting, and a cool down.\nNeighbors A has been promoted to manager at their job and is taking on more responsibilities.\nNeighbors A feels like they are making a real impact at the company and is driven and motivated.\nNeighbors B is trying to get into a workout routine but is finding it hard to stay motivated.\nNeighbors A offers to help Neighbors B with getting into a workout routine.\nNeighbors A is feeling overwhelmed and stressed, mentioning having a lot on their plate.\nNeighbors A was recently promoted to manager and is struggling to adjust to the new responsibilities.\nNeighbors A tries to work out every morning to relieve stress but has been finding it difficult to maintain.\nNeighbors B offers to be more supportive and check in on Neighbors A more often.\nNeighbors B suggests working out together to make it more enjoyable for both of them.\nBoth neighbors emphasize the importance of taking care of each other as neighbors.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nNeighbors A: I marked the boundary line with a pen on the wall so that we can both be clear about where my property ends and your property begins.\nNeighbors B: Oh, okay. I didn't realize there was any confusion about that.\nNeighbors A: Well, I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page. I don't want any misunderstandings in the future.\nNeighbors B: I understand. Is there anything else we should do to make sure we're clear about this? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nNeighbors A: I think we've covered everything for now. Thank you for being understanding.\nRESPONSE 2\nNeighbors A: Maybe we could both take a look at the property survey together to confirm the boundaries. That way, we can avoid any potential issues in the future.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses maintain the context of the current conversation about property boundaries. However, neither response directly recalls past memories or relates to previous events, skills, or interests shared between Neighbors A and B. The past memories mention personal and career developments, shared interests in reading, and mutual support in fitness and career aspirations. Response 2, by suggesting a joint activity of reviewing the property survey, could be slightly tied to the collaborative spirit seen in the past, such as working out together or supporting each other's goals. Despite this, neither response significantly reflects past memorability, making it difficult to establish a clear connection.\n\nChoice: tie"
