I've been doing it every day for the past week and it's made such a difference.\nNeighbors B: That's really interesting. I've heard that breathing exercises can be really helpful for reducing stress and anxiety.\nNeighbors A: Yes, it definitely has helped me with that. Plus, it's something that I can easily do anywhere, whether I'm at home or out running errands.\nNeighbors B: That's great. It's always good to have a simple tool like that to help manage stress. \nNeighbors A: Speaking of managing stress, remember a few years ago when I pushed your shoulder because I wanted you to accept me?\nNeighbors B: Oh yeah, I do remember that.

It was such a special place for us.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses recall the memory of finding a great park a few years ago and enjoying it, which is a detail from the past memories. However, Response 2 particularly highlights the act of reminiscing about simpler times, which directly ties to another specific memory where Neighbor A expressed missing simpler times. This adds an extra layer of reflection on past memories and gives it a slightly higher degree of memorability than Response 1.\n\nChoice: 2"
