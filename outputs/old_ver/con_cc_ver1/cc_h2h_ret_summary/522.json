    "prediction": "Explanation: The key memory here is that Neighbor A is grieving and Neighbor B is providing support, highlighting a strong friendship where they have been there for each other before during difficult times. Response 2 is more memorable because it directly alludes to and reinforces the ongoing support and companionship that Neighbor B has consistently offered to Neighbor A, a recurring theme found in their past interactions. It emphasizes the togetherness and shared journey during challenging times, making it a more coherent continuation of their shared history. Response 1 lacks this element of shared effort and history, making it less reflective of their past.\n\nChoice: 2"
