Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking?\nCo-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for asking me to join you.\nCo-workers A: No problem, it'll be great to catch up. Hey, do you remember when we talked about me being irresponsible a few years ago?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, I remember that conversation. What about it?\nCo-workers A: Well, I wanted to share some good news with you. I've been recently promoted to the night shift and have been doing a great job. I think I've come a long way since those days.\nCo-workers B: That's awesome, congratulations! I'm proud of you and all the hard work you've put in. You've definitely grown and matured in the workplace. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers A: Thanks, I really appreciate your support and encouragement. It means a lot coming from you.\nRESPONSE 2\nCo-workers A: Thank you so much for your kind words and support. It means a lot coming from you. I really appreciate it.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses, \"1\" and \"2,\" express gratitude for Co-worker B's support and encouragement. However, neither response explicitly recalls or reflects on specific past memories, especially the ones related to Co-worker A's previous irresponsibility or the impact on Co-worker B. Response 2 slightly expands on the expression of appreciation with added words, but it does not enhance memorability by invoking past context or experiences. Since both responses are equally lacking in recalling specific past memories, they are tied in terms of Memorability.\n\nChoice: tie"
