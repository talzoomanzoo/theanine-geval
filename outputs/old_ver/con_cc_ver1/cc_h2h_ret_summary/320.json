    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nCo-worker A has been getting written up for being late to work.\nCo-worker B is concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits.\nCo-worker A is trying to improve their punctuality and cut back on drinking.\nCo-worker B advises Co-worker A to be more disciplined and plan ahead for their actions.\nBoth co-workers show a supportive and caring attitude towards each other.\nCo-worker A was a leader in their country, making it prosperous and safe.\nCo-worker A believes their success as a leader was due to determination and strength of character.\nCo-worker B is supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable.\nCo-worker A has been successful in not being late to work for weeks.\nCo-worker A recently moved to a new duplex with two floors, having their bedroom on the first floor and another room on the second floor.\nCo-worker B is aware of Co-worker A's struggles with late nights out and expensive Uber rides.\nCo-worker A enjoys the extra space in their new place and appreciates the separation between living and sleeping areas for privacy.\nCo-worker A is trying to be more responsible but still working on avoiding late nights out and expensive rides.\nCo-worker A went through a painful breakup and finds it hard to trust people.\nCo-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to give people a chance.\nCo-worker A is open to taking things slow and potentially finding a special person.\nCo-worker A and their ex have both moved on from the breakup.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today?\nCo-workers B: No, you didn't. What did you do there?\nCo-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done.\nCo-workers B: That's good. I hate going to the post office. It's always so crowded.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it was pretty busy today. But I needed to get this package sent out.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of packages, remember that time when you got stranded because you couldn't drive yourself home from a night out with friends? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nCo-workers A: Yeah, that was a rough night. I've been working on being more responsible with my outings since then.\nRESPONSE 2\nCo-workers A: Yeah, that was definitely a wake-up call for me. I'm trying to be more responsible and avoid situations like that in the future. I appreciate your support in helping me stay on track.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "As per the past memories, Co-worker A has had issues with late nights out and the need for expensive Uber rides. Co-worker B has a supportive and caring attitude towards Co-worker A's goals of being more responsible. Both responses touch on Co-worker A's efforts to improve their responsibility but vary in level of appreciation towards Co-worker B's support.\n\nResponse 1 acknowledges the past experience and Co-worker A's ongoing efforts to improve, but does not explicitly engage with Co-worker B's supportive role. On the other hand, Response 2 not only acknowledges the past incident and current self-improvement goals but also reflects gratitude towards Co-worker B for their supportive role. This makes Response 2 more aligned with the memorability criterion, as it reflects the past memories of Co-worker B being supportive and encouraging of Co-worker A's improvement and deals with the ongoing challenges related to outings.\n\nExplanation: Response 2 reflects the past memories of Co-worker B's supportive role and Co-worker A's ongoing journey towards responsibility more strongly.\nChoice: 2"
