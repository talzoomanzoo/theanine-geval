    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response directly reflects past memories related to specific incidents, mix-ups, or the friendship dynamics mentioned. However, Response 2, despite not calling back on specific past events, aligns more with the consistent appreciation Classmates A has shown for Classmates B's supportive nature, echoing their friendship's strength and camaraderie. Response 1 misses that element and comes off as more generic without the depth that the past memories indicate should be addressed.\n\nChoice: 2"
