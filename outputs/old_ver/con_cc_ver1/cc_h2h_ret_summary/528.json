Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nClassmate A is nervous about an upcoming presentation and has been practicing a lot.\nClassmate B offers support and suggests practicing in front of friends or family for feedback.\nClassmate A has tried practicing in front of others but still feels nervous.\nClassmate B advises Classmate A to take deep breaths, stay confident, and focus on delivery.\nClassmate A acknowledges the advice and agrees to stay confident and focus on delivery.\nClassmate B emphasizes the importance of practice for improving comfort during presentations.\nClassmate A appreciates the support and understanding from Classmate B.\nClassmate B reassures Classmate A that they are all in it together and offers help if needed.\nClassmates A has a big dream of becoming a professional basketball player and works hard towards that goal.\nClassmates B encourages Classmates A to keep pushing themselves and not let doubts hold them back.\nClassmates A practices basketball every day, both individually and with their team, and also does weight training to build strength.\nClassmates A sometimes doubts if they are good enough to make it to the professional level.\nClassmates B advises Classmates A to stay focused on their goal, believe in themselves, and ask for help if needed.\nClassmates A decided to work at the local grocery store for its proximity to home, flexible hours, and networking opportunities.\nClassmates A started working at the grocery store last week and is enjoying the experience, learning about running a store.\nClassmates A balances their job with basketball practice by scheduling shifts around practice time and requesting time off for games or tournaments.\nClassmates A believes in hard work and dedication to achieve goals both in basketball and their job.\nClassmate A is pursuing a dream of becoming a professional basketball player and is working at a grocery store to save up money for training.\nClassmate B brought goods to Classmate A's house and is supportive of their basketball dream.\nBoth classmates have a positive attitude towards each other and their respective goals.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nClassmates A: I can't believe I got caught cheating on my taxes. This is such a mess.\nClassmates B: Wait, what? You cheated on your taxes? That's not okay. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nClassmates A: I know, I messed up big time. I need to figure out how to fix this situation.\nRESPONSE 2\nClassmates A: I know, I panicked and made a stupid mistake. I'm really stressed about it.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response directly recalls any of the past memories related to practicing presentations, basketball goals, job at the grocery store, or the support dynamics recently described. However, both responses reflect Classmate A's recognition of a mistake and their current stress or need to fix the situation, which aligns with their previously expressed experiences of facing challenges (like nervousness before a presentation). Response 2 slightly edges out as it provides more insight into Classmate A's emotional state, similar to past instances of feeling nervous and seeking support from Classmate B. However, neither option strongly integrates with specific past memories of encouragement and mutual support.\n\nChoice: tie"
