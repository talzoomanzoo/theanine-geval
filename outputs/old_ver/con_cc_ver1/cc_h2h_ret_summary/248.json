    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response directly recalls or reflects upon specific past memories shared between Co-worker A and Co-worker B. Response 2 refers to support from a friend, implicitly recalling the friendly dynamic and support they have for each other, but does not explicitly tie back to any past memories. Response 1 also does not explicitly recall any past memories or shared experiences. As such, both responses have a similar level of memorability concerning the given past memories.\n\nChoice: tie"
