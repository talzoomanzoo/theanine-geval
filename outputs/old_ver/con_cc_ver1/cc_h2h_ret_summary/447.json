    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nNeighbors A spilled coffee on their shirt after tripping over a rug corner in the living room.\nNeighbors A's rug keeps curling up at the corners.\nNeighbors B suggested using rug grippers and a rug pad to keep the rug in place.\nNeighbors A thanked Neighbors B for the suggestion.\nNeighbors A saw puppies at the pet store and found them adorable, making their heart race and couldn't stop smiling.\nNeighbors A got to hold the puppies and found them cuddly and playful, wishing they could take them all home.\nNeighbors B once saw a litter of kittens at the animal shelter and found it hard to resist taking one home.\nBoth neighbors express the difficulty of not being able to adopt all the animals they see but appreciate those who do adopt and give them loving homes.\nNeighbors A bought a necklace from Neighbors B's shop and loves it.\nNeighbors A got a necklace with a blue stone that matches well with work clothes.\nNeighbors A was looking for a new necklace and stumbled upon Neighbors B's shop.\nNeighbors A has an upcoming wedding and needs accessories, specifically earrings.\nNeighbors B has a great selection of earrings and is willing to help find the perfect match for the dress.\nNeighbors A has a picture of the dress on their phone and will show it to Neighbors B.\nNeighbors B thinks they have the perfect pair of earrings to complement the dress.\nNeighbors A struggled with apologizing and admitting when they are wrong.\nNeighbors B emphasized the importance of apologizing to show care for the relationship.\nNeighbors A made an insensitive comment to a coworker, leading to the need for an apology.\nNeighbors A is considering writing a letter to apologize to the coworker.\nNeighbors B offered to help Neighbors A with the apology process.\nBoth neighbors agreed that apologizing takes strength, not weakness.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nNeighbors A: It's great to have friends who can help each other out, isn't it?\nNeighbors B: Absolutely. It's a two-way street, and it's important to be there for each other.\nNeighbors A: I remember when I helped you move last year, and then you watched my cat when I went on vacation.\nNeighbors B: Yes, and I appreciate it so much. It's always nice to have someone you can count on.\nNeighbors A: That's true. And speaking of which, I'm helping another friend move next weekend. It'll be a big job, but I know they'd do the same for me.\nNeighbors B: That's great. And if you need any help, just let me know. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nNeighbors A: Thanks, I appreciate that. I'll keep that in mind.\nRESPONSE 2\nNeighbors A: Thanks, I really appreciate that. It's good to know I have someone I can rely on if I need it.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "I apologize for the confusion, but the explanation message appears to be incomplete. I will provide a correct explanation per your instructions. \n\nExplanation: \nNeither response directly references past memories in a way that makes one more memorable than the other. Both responses express gratitude for Neighbors B's offer to help and emphasize the importance of being able to rely on friends, which is a general theme of the conversation. Given the criterion of memorability, neither response particularly recalls specific past memories such as the coffee-spilling incident, the pet store visit, or the necklace purchase. However, the second response slightly echoes the conversation about support and reliability, which is consistent with the past memory of Neighbors B helping with the apology process and other support scenarios. It is a subtle reflection of mutual support.\n\nChoice: 2"
