    "prediction": "Explanation: The criterion of memorability is focused on recalling past memories effectively. Response 2 is directly more memorable as it references the shared memory of finding solace in nature and previously going for walks in the park together. It shows Neighbor A suggesting an activity that has been comforting for them in the past, which aligns with the detailed background information. Response 1, while expressing gratitude, does not leverage any specific past shared experiences or memories to make it memorable.\n\nChoice: 2"
