    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 1 makes a general comment about the moments of peace but does not explicitly connect back to specific past memories. Response 2, on the other hand, explicitly recalls the past memory of Classmate A experiencing pain in their arm and waiting for it to subside, which is a situation from the past memories where listening to one's body was discussed. Additionally, the emphasis on taking breaks closely links to the shared value both classmates have of appreciating small things and moments of relaxation, further enhancing memorability.\n\nChoice: 2"
