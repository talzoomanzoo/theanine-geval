However, Response 2 is more memorable because it not only encourages the Mentee to continue embracing the moment, but it also specifically highlights the importance of practicing mindfulness and savoring experiencesâ€”key elements mentioned in the past memories. Response 2 also connects the Mentee's newfound joy with their broader journey, thus better integrating the Mentee's past struggles and growth, and reaffirms the Mentor's pride in the Mentee's progress.\n\nChoice: 2"
