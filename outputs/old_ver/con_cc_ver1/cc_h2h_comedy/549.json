    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 2 is more reflective of past memories, particularly the friendly and supportive relationship between Classmates A and B that has been previously established. It echoes their mutual understanding and support, as seen when Classmates B finds it awesome that Classmate A is pursuing music after a conversation about following dreams. Response 2 also makes mention of not being a burden and supports the notion of independence, which aligns with Classmates B's interest in learning to play an instrument and working on an original song. Response 1 provides a general offer of support but does not as effectively recall specific aspects of their past interactions.\n\nChoice: 2"
