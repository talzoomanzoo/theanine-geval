    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nClassmates A and B are discussing beverage choices, with A considering between Coke and Sprite.\nClassmate B suggests Sprite Zero as a less sweet alternative to regular Sprite.\nClassmates A and B are both keeping up with the homework in their math class.\nThey both find the workload manageable and appreciate the gradual introduction of more difficult topics.\nThey are pleased with their teacher's understanding of their adjustment to the new school year.\nClassmates A plays the guitar, takes lessons, and plays in a band.\nClassmates B is interested in learning to play an instrument.\nClassmates A started playing the guitar because of a love for music and is working on their first album.\nClassmates A's band mostly plays at local bars and coffee shops.\nClassmates A's band is trying to build up their fan base and play at bigger venues.\nClassmates A finds pursuing music rewarding and is passionate about it.\nClassmates B finds it awesome that Classmates A is pursuing their passion for music after a conversation they had about following dreams.\nClassmates A bought a sleek and red Mustang GT car.\nClassmates A has been dreaming of owning a Mustang GT since childhood.\nClassmates B is working on a new original song on the guitar.\nClassmates A and B enjoy jamming together and plan to collaborate on music in the future.\nClassmates A plans to showcase their new car by driving it around town and to gigs.\nClassmates A and B plan to celebrate the new car with a drink.\nClassmates A enjoys reminiscing about childhood memories, particularly about playing on swings and making music with friends.\nClassmates A is in a band and working on their first album.\nClassmates B recently bought a red sports car and finds driving it to be fun and freeing.\nClassmates A and B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as evidenced by their conversation about their respective experiences.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nClassmates A: Hey, how are you feeling today?\nClassmates B: I'm feeling frustrated. I wish I could do things on my own.\nClassmates A: I understand how you feel. It can be tough when you feel like you're dependent on others.\nClassmates B: Yeah, exactly. I don't want to be a burden on anyone.\nClassmates A: You're not a burden, don't worry. And I'm always here to help you out.\nClassmates B: I appreciate that, but I don't want to always rely on others. I want to be more independent.\nClassmates A: I get it. Maybe there are some small things you can do on your own to start feeling more independent?\nClassmates B: Like what?\nClassmates A: Well, maybe you can start by making a list of things you'd like to do on your own and we can work on achieving those goals together.\nClassmates B: That sounds like a good idea. Thanks for understanding, Classmates A. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nClassmates A: Of course, we can definitely work on that together. Just let me know how I can support you.\nRESPONSE 2\nClassmates A:  Maybe you can start by setting small goals for yourself, like learning a new song on your instrument or taking a drive in your Mustang GT to a new location. It's important to remember that it's okay to ask for help and support when you need it, but it's also empowering to take small steps towards independence. I'm here to support you every step of the way, Classmates B.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 is a general offer of support without recalling any specific past memories. It does not reference any of the shared experiences or motivations discussed previously. On the other hand, Response 2 draws directly from past memories: Classmate B's interest in learning an instrument and their recent purchase of a red sports car (although it was Classmate A who bought the Mustang GT, so there's a slight inaccuracy here). By suggesting learning a new song or taking a drive (even though it's mistakenly attributed to Classmate B), Response 2 attempts to connect with activities discussed in the past. Additionally, it acknowledges their mutual support system in a more detailed context, linking to their conversation about pursuing independence.\n\nChoice: 2"
