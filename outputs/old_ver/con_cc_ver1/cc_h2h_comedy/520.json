I thought we were happy together.\nNeighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left?\nNeighbors A: No, I haven't. I don't even know what I would say to him. I feel like I'm not enough, like I wasn't good enough for him. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nNeighbors B: It's understandable to feel that way, but remember that your worth isn't defined by someone else's actions. You deserve someone who appreciates and values you for who you are.\nRESPONSE 2\nNeighbors B:  I'm really sorry to hear that, Neighbor A. It must be tough feeling like that. Remember, you are more than enough and deserve to be with someone who appreciates you for who you are. How about we go for a walk in the park like we used to with your grandmother? It might help clear your mind and lift your spirits. And after that, we can come back and play some video games together. What do you say?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 2 reflects stronger memorability as it references past memories of going for walks in the park, a shared activity that Neighbor A and Neighbor B have done before. It also sensitively connects this suggestion to Neighbor A's grief over their grandmother, implying that such activities helped previously. Additionally, it offers support by suggesting they follow up with their planned video game session, reinforcing their shared bond and routine.\n\nChoice: 2"
