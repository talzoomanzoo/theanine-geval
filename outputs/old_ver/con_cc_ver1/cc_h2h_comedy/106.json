    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nNeighbors A and B are observing wood that appears to be freshly cut from a tree.\nNeighbors A and B discuss the possibility of someone in the neighborhood using the wood for a project.\nNeighbors A recalls a previous storm that caused trees to fall down, leading to the availability of wood for projects.\nNeighbors A and B appreciate the resourcefulness of using fallen trees for firewood or other purposes.\nNeighbors A and B emphasize the importance of taking care of trees and the environment for future generations.\nNeighbor A apologized to Neighbor B for their behavior and expressed a desire to make amends.\nNeighbor B accepted Neighbor A's apology and mentioned that it was hurtful to be treated that way.\nNeighbor A values their friendship with Neighbor B and wants to ensure it remains strong.\nNeighbor A noticed some wood near their backyard and asked Neighbor B if they had seen it too.\nNeighbor B suggested that the wood may be leftover from city tree trimming activities.\nNeighbors A forgot their backpack at home before going to school.\nNeighbors A stayed up all night studying for a test and feels terrible about forgetting the backpack.\nNeighbors A did not bring any notes or textbooks to school.\nNeighbors B suggests talking to the teacher to see if Neighbors A can take the test another day.\nNeighbors A feels like they should have been more prepared for the test.\nNeighbors B reminds Neighbors A about taking responsibility for their mistakes in the past and learning from them.\nNeighbors B offers help and support to Neighbors A in the situation.\nNeighbors A is good at fixing things, particularly electronics.\nNeighbors B appreciates Neighbors A's handy skills.\nNeighbors A left their backpack at home once and had to borrow notes from a classmate.\nNeighbors A values double-checking before leaving the house.\nNeighbors A apologized to Neighbors B for their behavior and admitted to being wrong.\nNeighbors A and B were able to resolve their issues and maintain a friendly relationship.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, have you noticed how strong I've become?\nNeighbors B: Wow, you do look very strong! Have you been working out?\nNeighbors A: Yes, I go to the gym every day and lift weights. It's been really helping me build muscle. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nNeighbors B: That's awesome, all that hard work is really paying off! Keep it up!\nRESPONSE 2\nNeighbors B:  That's impressive, Neighbor A! Your dedication to working out every day really shows in your strength. Keep up the good work!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "As there is no direct past memory related to Neighbors A's strength or gym activities, memorability in this context relates to the ongoing narrative of self-improvement and appreciation, which is a recurring theme in their previous conversations. Both responses acknowledge Neighbor A's hard work and appreciation, aligning with past instances of appreciation for each other's efforts, such as Neighbor B appreciating Neighbor A's handy skills.\n\nResponse 1 focuses on congratulating Neighbor A on their hard work and encourages them to continue, aligning with positive reinforcement themes seen in past interactions.\n\nResponse 2 similarly congratulates Neighbor A's dedication but also adds a more personal touch by stating that it \"really shows in your strength,\" which ties back to themes of observable benefits from efforts made, like appreciating the resourcefulness of using fallen trees or suggesting more preparedness.\n\nHowever, neither response directly utilizes specific past memories mentioned, such as mistakes, environmental care, or friendship mending, making it difficult to clearly prioritize one response based on memorability. Thus, both responses equally align with the ongoing themes of support and improvement.\n\nChoice: tie"
