    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 2 is the more memorable option as it explicitly recalls specific past memories related to the classmates' experiences at the mall â€“ mentioning people watching and comparing it to the way their class brings together diverse perspectives. The mention of \"retail therapy\" also connects with their decision to go to the mall for retail therapy in the past. This response leverages past memories effectively by drawing parallels between those experiences and the current conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
