    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 2 is better in terms of memorability because it not only responds to the question about the guitar playing but also recalls past memories related to it. It specifically mentions practicing a lot and having written a new song, which ties back to Classmate B's past memory of working on new original songs on the guitar. Additionally, it reinforces the supportive relationship by acknowledging Classmates A's support, which is consistent with their past interactions. In contrast, Response 1 is more general and does not recall specific shared memories or details from their past conversations.\n\nChoice: 2"
