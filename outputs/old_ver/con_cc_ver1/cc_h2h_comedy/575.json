Have you tried studying or working in a different location?\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home.\nNeighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nNeighbors A: Thanks for the reminder. I'll head to the library and get back on track with this project.\nRESPONSE 2\nNeighbors A:  \nThat's a great idea to try working at the library! Maybe being in a different environment will help you focus better. And remember, the longer you put off the project, the more stressful it will become. Just think about how relieved you'll feel once it's done.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response reflects past memories as there are no references to any shared history between Neighbors A and B from the provided memories. Both responses only address the immediate context of the current conversation about procrastination and methods to overcome it, such as working in a different location like the library. Despite lacking references to past memories, Response 2 has a slight edge because it includes a motivational aspect, encouraging Neighbor A to think about the relief they will feel once the project is completed, which resonates with Neighbor B's suggestion about planning ahead and remembering the positive aspects of completing tasks.\n\nChoice: 2"
