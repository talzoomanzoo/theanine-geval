    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nNeighbors A spilled coffee on their shirt after tripping over a rug corner in the living room.\nNeighbors A's rug keeps curling up at the corners.\nNeighbors B suggested using rug grippers and a rug pad to keep the rug in place.\nNeighbors A thanked Neighbors B for the suggestion.\nNeighbors A saw puppies at the pet store and found them adorable, making their heart race and couldn't stop smiling.\nNeighbors A got to hold the puppies and found them cuddly and playful, wishing they could take them all home.\nNeighbors B once saw a litter of kittens at the animal shelter and found it hard to resist taking one home.\nBoth neighbors express the difficulty of not being able to adopt all the animals they see but appreciate those who do adopt and give them loving homes.\nNeighbors A bought a necklace from Neighbors B's shop and loves it.\nNeighbors A got a necklace with a blue stone that matches well with work clothes.\nNeighbors A was looking for a new necklace and stumbled upon Neighbors B's shop.\nNeighbors A has an upcoming wedding and needs accessories, specifically earrings.\nNeighbors B has a great selection of earrings and is willing to help find the perfect match for the dress.\nNeighbors A has a picture of the dress on their phone and will show it to Neighbors B.\nNeighbors B thinks they have the perfect pair of earrings to complement the dress.\nNeighbors A struggled with apologizing and admitting when they are wrong.\nNeighbors B emphasized the importance of apologizing to show care for the relationship.\nNeighbors A made an insensitive comment to a coworker, leading to the need for an apology.\nNeighbors A is considering writing a letter to apologize to the coworker.\nNeighbors B offered to help Neighbors A with the apology process.\nBoth neighbors agreed that apologizing takes strength, not weakness.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nNeighbors A: It's great to have friends who can help each other out, isn't it?\nNeighbors B: Absolutely. It's a two-way street, and it's important to be there for each other.\nNeighbors A: I remember when I helped you move last year, and then you watched my cat when I went on vacation.\nNeighbors B: Yes, and I appreciate it so much. It's always nice to have someone you can count on. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nNeighbors A: Definitely, it makes life a lot easier when you know you have someone you can rely on.\nRESPONSE 2\nNeighbors A: I'm glad we can rely on each other for support. It really makes a difference to know we have each other's backs.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses acknowledge the mutual support and reliance that exists between the neighbors, which relates back to their previous experiences of helping each other. However, neither response explicitly refers to a specific past incident from the memories provided, such as the moving day, the cat-watching favor, or the previous exchanges concerning the spilled coffee or the necklace purchase. Both responses generally reflect the past relationship dynamics but fail to directly recall specific past memories.\n\nChoice: tie"
