    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 2 reflects on past memories by referencing Classmates B's advice and encouragement, which were previously noted as influential in Classmates A's decision to take risks and pursue their passions. This not only highlights the positive impact of Classmates B's support but also reinforces the theme of stepping out of comfort zones for personal growth, which is a key aspect of their past interactions. Response 1, while appreciative, does not reference any past interactions or shared experiences, thus lacking memorability.\n\nChoice: 2"
