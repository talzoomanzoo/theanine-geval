    "prediction": "Explanation: \nBoth responses acknowledge Neighbor A's excitement about their newfound wealth and their interest in pursuing new business ventures. However, Response 2 better reflects the past memories by mentioning Neighbor A's \"entrepreneurial spirit,\" which ties back to Neighbors A's past desire for growth and challenge in their career, their recent career change that made them happier, and Neighbor B's support and admiration for their courage in making those changes. Additionally, it aligns with Neighbors A's mention of feeling stuck in their previous job and now having more freedom, which the windfall has amplified. This makes Response 2 more memorable in the context of the conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
