    "prediction": "Explanation: \nThe task is to determine which response has better Memorability, meaning that it should properly recall past memories when needed. In the current conversation, Response 1 connects better to the past memories by emphasizing the idea of taking a new class, which ties back to Classmates A considering taking a dance class for fun. This shows a continuity in Classmates A's willingness to learn and challenge themselves with new skills. Additionally, like taking dance classes, taking a coding class can be seen as a positive outlet, providing a potential escape from the tough times at home, which resonates with Classmates B's supportive role. Whereas Response 2 does not directly reflect or connect with specific past events or reflections mentioned in the memories.\n\nChoice: 1"
