Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nNeighbors A and B don't know each other well and want to spend more time together.\nThey plan to hang out once a week, possibly watching a movie, getting coffee, or just talking.\nThey both agree to start this weekend and are looking forward to it.\nNeighbors A and B are on friendly terms and enjoy spending time together.\nNeighbors A and B have not seen each other in a while and are catching up.\nNeighbors A is looking for new hobbies to try out.\nNeighbors B enjoys cooking and suggests making something together.\nNeighbors A and B plan to start a monthly dinner party with other neighbors.\nThe first dinner party will involve making homemade pizzas.\nNeighbors A and Neighbors B are both neighbors who have known each other for years and have become good friends.\nNeighbors A mentioned mowing the lawn with an old push mower, indicating they are responsible for the yard work.\nNeighbors B agrees that mowing the lawn is a lot of work but acknowledges the exercise it provides.\nNeighbors A and B have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside.\nNeighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\nNeighbors A and B plan to work on mowing the lawn together next time to make it easier and possibly discover more things in common.\nBoth Neighbors A and B enjoy spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn.\nNeighbor A's mom scolds them for ripping off the tag from their new shirt.\nNeighbor A feels pressured to look perfect all the time by their mom.\nNeighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\nNeighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A.\nNeighbor A enjoys spending time in Neighbor B's cozy home and wants to hang out more often.\nNeighbor A and Neighbor B plan to have a movie night together soon.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit.\nNeighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water.\nNeighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it.\nNeighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again.\nNeighbors A: I won't. So, do you remember the time when I mowed the lawn with that old push mower?\nNeighbors B: Yeah, I remember that. That was pretty tough work.\nNeighbors A: It was. But it was also a good workout.\nNeighbors B: I prefer to work out indoors where there's air conditioning. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nNeighbors A: That's fair, everyone has their own preferences when it comes to working out. Do you have a favorite indoor workout routine?\nRESPONSE 2\nNeighbors A: I get that, but being outside in the fresh air has its own charm, don't you think? Maybe next time we tackle the lawn together, we can make it more enjoyable and get the job done faster.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 2 reflects on the shared memory of Neighbors A and B planning to work on mowing the lawn together to make it easier and possibly discover more things in common. It recalls their plans and suggests collaborating on the task, which is a memory from their past interactions about doing chores together and enjoying being outside. Response 1, on the other hand, shifts the conversation to a different topic without connecting back to their shared experiences or plans related to yard work. Therefore, Response 2 has higher memorability as it ties back to a specific past memory.\n\nChoice: 2"
