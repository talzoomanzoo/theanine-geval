    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 2 is a better option because it acknowledges the new memory of Co-worker A singing a solo at church and also reflects on Co-worker B's previous surprise and admiration for Co-worker A's talents, such as solving mysteries and puzzles. By asking how it felt to sing in front of everyone, it implicitly recognizes the skills and confidence Co-worker A has shown in other areas (like detective work) and connects to past experiences of performing or achieving something noteworthy. In contrast, Response 1 only shows generic admiration without connecting to shared memories or past roles.\n\nChoice: 2"
