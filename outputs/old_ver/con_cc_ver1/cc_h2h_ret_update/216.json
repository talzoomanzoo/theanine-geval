    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 2 has higher memorability because it recalls the importance of the friendship and growth between Neighbors A and B, which is a significant part of their past memories. It acknowledges the embarrassing incident and highlights how they have moved past it and become closer, reflecting on the neighbors' shared history and appreciation for their relationship. Response 1, while apologizing for the past incident, does not evoke as much of their shared history and growth as Response 2 does.\n\nChoice: 2"
