    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nNeighbor A has been dealing with back pain for a few months but sought help from a chiropractor, avoiding surgery.\nNeighbor B is interested in chiropractic care after hearing about Neighbor A's positive experience.\nNeighbor A found the chiropractor through a friend's recommendation and found the treatments to be relaxing.\nNeighbor B is experiencing neck pain and considering trying chiropractic care as a natural alternative to medication.\nNeighbor A offered to provide the name of their chiropractor to Neighbor B if they decide to go.\nNeighbors A and Neighbors B enjoy playing together with toys.\nNeighbors A mentions having back pain and needing a break.\nNeighbors A has visited a chiropractor recently for their back pain.\nNeighbors B expresses concern for Neighbors A's back pain.\nNeighbors A plans to go back to the chiropractor for another session.\nNeighbors A looks forward to playing with Neighbors B again when feeling better.\nNeighbors A recently moved to London from their current location.\nNeighbors A packed up their belongings and moved into a small apartment in London.\nNeighbors A is enjoying the different culture and exploring the city.\nNeighbors A has already visited major tourist attractions like Big Ben and the London Eye.\nNeighbors A found some of their dog's toys while packing, indicating they have a golden retriever.\nNeighbors B is familiar with Neighbors A's dog and looking forward to playing with it again.\nNeighbors A burned the roast and felt angry and out of control.\nNeighbors B suggested trying anger management techniques like deep breathing or meditation.\nNeighbors A moved to London in the past and had to learn how to manage stress.\nNeighbors A appreciated the support and friendship of Neighbors B.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, how's it going?\nNeighbors B: Not bad, thanks. How about you?\nNeighbors A: Oh, I'm doing alright. I was just thinking about the old days when I had my rock band.\nNeighbors B: Really? You had a band?\nNeighbors A: Yeah, we were called \"The Neighbors A Band.\" We used to play live shows around the city. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nNeighbors B: That sounds like a lot of fun. Do you still play music at all?\nRESPONSE 2\nNeighbors B: That's so cool! I had no idea you were in a band. What instrument did you play?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The criterion for this task is Memorability, which involves recalling relevant past memories. In this situation, the conversation is about Neighbor A reminiscing about their past involvement in a rock band. There isn't a specific detail from past memories about the band or music playing that needs to be recalled. Both responses focus on learning more about Neighbor A's musical past, but do not explicitly reference past memories shared between the neighbors, such as the chiropractor, move to London, or their friendship activities like playing with toys or concern for each other's health conditions.\n\nTherefore, neither response evokes or refers to any particular past memory documented, as the topic (rock band) is new information revealed in this conversation. Considering Memorability alone, neither response stands out as significantly better because they are equally unrelated to past memories provided.\n\nChoice: tie"
