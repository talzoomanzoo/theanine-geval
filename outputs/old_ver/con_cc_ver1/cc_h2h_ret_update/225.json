Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nNeighbors A saw something they believe to be a UFO and are still shaken up about it.\nNeighbors B is supportive and believes Neighbors A's story, suggesting looking up UFO sightings in the area.\nNeighbors A's husband thinks they are crazy for believing they saw a UFO.\nNeighbors A plans to do some research and possibly report the sighting of the UFO.\nNeighbors A appreciates Neighbors B's understanding and willingness to listen and talk about the experience.\nNeighbor A is tired from work and needs to catch up on sleep.\nNeighbor B is upset that Neighbor A doesn't want to go to the party with them.\nNeighbor B is worried about looking stupid if they show up at the party alone.\nNeighbor A didn't know they wouldn't feel up for the party until now.\nNeighbor A suggests planning something else to do together over the weekend.\nNeighbor A mentions seeing a UFO and wants to discuss it with Neighbor B.\nNeighbors A is feeling stagnant in their current job and is looking for more growth and challenge.\nNeighbors B has been supportive of Neighbors A's job search, offering to connect them with people in different industries.\nNeighbors A plans to start looking for new opportunities soon and needs to update their resume and start networking.\nNeighbors B has knowledge of people in different industries and is willing to help Neighbors A with their job search.\nNeighbors A believes they saw a UFO in their backyard and still thinks it was real, finding it crazy to think about.\nNeighbors A made a big career change recently and is much happier now.\nNeighbors B is considering taking a vacation to a town with beautiful beaches.\nNeighbors A and B had a conversation a couple of years ago about needing a change.\nNeighbors A took the leap to make a change and is glad they did.\nNeighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's decision and admires the courage it took.\nNeighbors A and B have a friendly and supportive relationship.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nNeighbors A: Can you believe it? I'm a millionaire now!\nNeighbors B: Wow, that's incredible! How did it happen?\nNeighbors A: I inherited it from a distant relative. It's still sinking in, to be honest.\nNeighbors B: That's amazing, congratulations! What are you going to do with all that money? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nNeighbors A: I'm still figuring out what to do with the money, but I definitely want to make sure it brings positive change in some way.\nRESPONSE 2\nNeighbors A: I'm still processing it myself! I want to make sure it's used wisely, maybe invest in some projects I'm passionate about. It's a lot to think about, but I'm grateful for this unexpected blessing.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses reflect on the current conversation about inheriting money, acknowledging its significance and the contemplation about its use. However, they do not directly refer to any past memories, such as their experiences of the UFO sighting, Neighbor B being supportive in various aspects, job search, career change, or planning activities together over the weekend. Since none of the responses enhances the memorability aspect by directly linking to the past memories, both responses are equal in this context.\n\nChoice: tie"
