    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses focus on the planned weekend getaway, but response 2 brings in memorability by connecting emotionally to the past experiences and values shared between the husband and wife. It emphasizes their togetherness, similar to how they have been committed to each other's dreams and supportive in past memories. It aligns with the husband's appreciation for the wife's positivity and support and the wifeâ€™s admiration for the husband's efforts. Response 1 is more transactional, with a practical step that doesn't recall as much past emotional context or support for each other as seen in past memories.\n\nChoice: 2"
