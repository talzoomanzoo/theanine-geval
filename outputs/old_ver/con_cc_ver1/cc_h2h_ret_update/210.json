    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nNeighbors A surprised Neighbors B with a pizza.\nNeighbors A ordered a large cheese pizza with extra sauce for Neighbors B.\nNeighbors A did this as a gesture of appreciation for Neighbors B's actions in the neighborhood.\nNeighbors B had tried the new restaurant down the street and found the food good but the service slow.\nNeighbors A ordered pizza for Neighbors B in the past.\nNeighbors A has developed romantic feelings for Neighbors B.\nNeighbors B values their friendship with Neighbors A.\nNeighbors A is willing to take things slow in their relationship with Neighbors B.\nBoth Neighbors A and B appreciate their friendship and are open to going back to being friends if the romantic relationship doesn't work out.\nNeighbor A recently discovered a park on Main Street with a playground and water park area.\nNeighbor A went to the park with their son, who had a great time.\nNeighbor A's daughter recently started high school, which has been a big adjustment for the family.\nNeighbor B has a son who also started high school and understands the challenges and excitement that come with it.\nBoth neighbors enjoy discovering new things in their neighborhood and spending time with their children.\nNeighbor A feels knowledgeable and like they understand everything, specifically about the history of their town.\nNeighbor B appreciates Neighbor A's thoughtfulness, mentioning a pizza Neighbor A ordered for them.\nNeighbor A is embarrassed about a past incident where they pushed Neighbor B's shoulder to gain acceptance.\nNeighbor A and Neighbor B found a park together a couple of years ago and enjoyed playing frisbee and having a picnic.\nNeighbor A reminisces about simpler times and expresses missing them.\nNeighbor B reassures Neighbor A about past embarrassing incidents and emphasizes their current friendship.\nBoth neighbors look forward to new adventures and discoveries in the future, appreciating the surprises and possibilities life offers.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nNeighbors A: I just tried this breathing exercise and it really helped me relax.\nNeighbors B: What kind of breathing exercise? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nNeighbors A: It's called box breathing. You inhale for four seconds, hold for four seconds, exhale for four seconds, and hold for four seconds again. It's quite calming.\nRESPONSE 2\nNeighbors A: It's a simple one where you inhale deeply for a count of four, hold it for seven, and then exhale slowly for eight. It's been surprisingly effective for calming me down.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nBoth responses focus on explaining a breathing exercise that Neighbor A tried, which is a new topic in the conversation and not directly related to past memories. There are no explicit connections or recall to past experiences, such as the pizza incident or visits to the park, detailed in either response. Therefore, the memorability criterion does not particularly favor one response over the other since neither response incorporates past memories into the current conversation. \n\nChoice: tie"
