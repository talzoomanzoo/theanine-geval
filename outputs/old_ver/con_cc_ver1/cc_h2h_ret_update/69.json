Let's focus on building each other up.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 2 shows a higher reflection of past memories compared to Response 1. Both Classmates A and B have a history of having a good relationship and admiration for each other, and they are open to exploring new connections. Classmates B forgiving A and suggesting support instead of destruction directly relates to their previously established good relationship, admiration, and mutual interests. Classmates B also offers to work on music together, which alludes to past discussions about singing and music, showing support for each other, and studying and learning together. Response 1, on the other hand, does not incorporate these positive reminisces, nor past admiration, and does not exhibit an openness to continuing the supportive nature of their relationship as highlighted in past memories.\n\nChoice: 2"
