I helped out a neighbor in need over the weekend.\nClassmates B: That's really kind of you. What did you do to help?\nClassmates A: She was moving and needed some extra hands to pack up her things and load them onto a truck.

I'm sure she really appreciated your assistance.\nRESPONSE 2\nClassmates B: Wow, that's so thoughtful of you to lend a helping hand! Your neighbor must have been really grateful for your assistance. It's great to see you making a positive impact in your community.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses express appreciation for Classmate A's kind act, but neither directly reflects past memories from the provided list. The conversation is about helping a neighbor, which is not directly aligned with the past memories outlined, such as mix-ups, alcohol consumption concerns, or friendship development. Therefore, the level of Memorability in this case is equal for both responses as neither one references past conversations or incidents.\n\nChoice: tie"
