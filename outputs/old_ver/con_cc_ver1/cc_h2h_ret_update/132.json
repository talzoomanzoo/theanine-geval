    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses refer to the past memory of Co-worker A returning the watch to Co-worker B, which was a significant event in mending their friendship. However, Response 1 uses the word \"symbolized,\" which specifically connects the gesture of returning the watch to the restoration of their friendship. This choice of language directly invokes the past memory more clearly by highlighting the impact of that specific event. Response 2 emphasizes the appreciation of the gesture and friendship but does not as directly link the act to the restoration of their friendship.\n\nChoice: 1"
