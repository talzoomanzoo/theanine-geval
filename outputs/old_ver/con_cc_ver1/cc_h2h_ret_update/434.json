    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nMentee is feeling sleepy and struggling to get enough sleep due to staying up late watching TV or using social media.\nMentor advises Mentee to listen to their body, set a bedtime, and create a relaxing routine before sleep.\nMentor emphasizes the importance of getting enough sleep for physical and mental well-being.\nMentee agrees to try the advice and express gratitude towards Mentor.\nMentee is currently living in an abusive and controlling cult.\nMentor also wants to escape the oppressive rules of the cult.\nMentee has found a shelter for people who have been in abusive cults and is planning to escape there.\nMentor advises caution and careful planning to avoid raising suspicion from the cult.\nBoth Mentee and Mentor agree to pack their things and get ready to leave without letting anyone know.\nMentor suggests waiting for the right moment to leave to ensure a smooth escape.\nMentee expresses feeling suffocated and eager to leave the cult.\nMentee wants to teach religion to help people find meaning in their lives.\nMentor warns Mentee to be careful not to be preachy or judgmental while teaching religion.\nMentee agrees to teach in a way that allows people to make their own decisions about their beliefs.\nMentee is doing research on different religions and plans to speak with religious leaders for guidance.\nMentor suggests Mentee volunteer at a local church or religious organization to gain experience.\nMentee is taking the idea of teaching religion seriously and wants to make a positive impact on people's lives.\nMentor encourages Mentee to approach teaching religion with an open mind and heart.\nMentor is from Italy and has lived in the United States.\nMentor was born and raised in a restrictive religious community.\nMentor became a mentor to help others going through similar situations.\nMentee has been thinking about helping others who may be in abusive cults.\nMentor and Mentee have discussed escaping an abusive cult in the past.\nMentor believes teaching religion or spiritual beliefs can help people feel connected and live by values.\nMentee wants to make a positive impact in people's lives and is grateful for Mentor's support.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nMentee: Mentor, have you ever tried to imagine what it would be like to think like someone else?\nMentor: Yes, I have. It's a great way to better understand and empathize with others.\nMentee: That's exactly what I thought. I've been trying to imagine what personY is thinking lately. It's been helping me to understand their perspective a bit better.\nMentor: That's a great approach. Putting ourselves in someone else's shoes can help us see things from a different angle and see where they're coming from.\nMentee: Exactly. And it also helps me to be more compassionate towards them. I think it's important for us to be more understanding and supportive of each other, especially in difficult times.\nMentor: I agree completely. It's important to be kind and compassionate towards others, especially when they may be going through something challenging. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nMentee: I've found that empathy and understanding go a long way in building stronger relationships and creating a more supportive environment for everyone involved.\nRESPONSE 2\nMentee: I couldn't agree more, Mentor. Being able to show compassion and understanding in difficult times can make a huge difference in someone's life. It's something I really want to embody in my efforts to help others.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 1 reflects general thoughts on empathy and understanding without tying back to any specific past memory. Response 2, however, explicitly connects the idea of compassion and understanding to the Mentee's goal of helping others, specifically in the context of abusive cults or through teaching religion, which are topics deeply discussed in their past conversations. Therefore, Response 2 has higher Memorability as it recalls the Mentee's aspirations and ongoing journey of helping others, embodying those values in a meaningful way related to past memories.\n\nChoice: 2"
