    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nNeighbors A and B don't know each other well and want to spend more time together.\nThey plan to hang out once a week, possibly watching a movie, getting coffee, or just talking.\nThey both agree to start this weekend and are looking forward to it.\nNeighbors A and B are on friendly terms and enjoy spending time together.\nNeighbors A and B have not seen each other in a while and are catching up.\nNeighbors A is looking for new hobbies to try out.\nNeighbors B enjoys cooking and suggests making something together.\nNeighbors A and B plan to start a monthly dinner party with other neighbors.\nThe first dinner party will involve making homemade pizzas.\nNeighbors A and Neighbors B are both neighbors who have known each other for years and have become good friends.\nNeighbors A mentioned mowing the lawn with an old push mower, indicating they are responsible for the yard work.\nNeighbors B agrees that mowing the lawn is a lot of work but acknowledges the exercise it provides.\nNeighbors A and B have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside.\nNeighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\nNeighbors A and B plan to work on mowing the lawn together next time to make it easier and possibly discover more things in common.\nBoth Neighbors A and B enjoy spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn.\nNeighbor A's mom scolds them for ripping off the tag from their new shirt.\nNeighbor A feels pressured to look perfect all the time by their mom.\nNeighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\nNeighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A.\nNeighbor A enjoys spending time in Neighbor B's cozy home and wants to hang out more often.\nNeighbor A and Neighbor B plan to have a movie night together soon.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit.\nNeighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water.\nNeighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it.\nNeighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again.\nNeighbors A: I won't. So, do you remember the time when I mowed the lawn with that old push mower?\nNeighbors B: Yeah, I remember that. That was pretty tough work.\nNeighbors A: It was. But it was also a good workout.\nNeighbors B: I prefer to work out indoors where there's air conditioning.\nNeighbors A: Ha, I remember when I took off my jacket and put my feet up in your armchair. It was so warm that day.\nNeighbors B: Yeah, that was a hot day. I'm glad you felt comfortable in my home though.\nNeighbors A: You know, I really enjoy spending time with you. I want to get to know you even better.\nNeighbors B: I feel the same way. We should plan something fun to do together. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nNeighbors A: How about we go for a walk in the park this weekend? It'll be nice to enjoy the outdoors together.\nRESPONSE 2\nNeighbors A: That sounds like a great idea! Maybe we can work on mowing the lawn together next time and have a nice chat while we're at it. What do you think?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nThe response that better reflects past memories would be the one that directly picks up on a previously discussed plan or common interest between the two neighbors. In this case, Response 2 recalls the past memory of Neighbors A and B planning to mow the lawn together and discovering more things in common, which demonstrates higher memorability. Although Response 1 suggests a new activity (going for a walk), it does not directly connect with any shared past memories or plans, unlike Response 2, which directly references a previous conversation about mowing the lawn together.\n\nChoice: 2"
