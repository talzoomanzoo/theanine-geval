    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nNeighbors A spilled coffee on their shirt after tripping over a rug corner in the living room.\nNeighbors A's rug keeps curling up at the corners.\nNeighbors B suggested using rug grippers and a rug pad to keep the rug in place.\nNeighbors A thanked Neighbors B for the suggestion.\nNeighbors A saw puppies at the pet store and found them adorable, making their heart race and couldn't stop smiling.\nNeighbors A got to hold the puppies and found them cuddly and playful, wishing they could take them all home.\nNeighbors B once saw a litter of kittens at the animal shelter and found it hard to resist taking one home.\nBoth neighbors express the difficulty of not being able to adopt all the animals they see but appreciate those who do adopt and give them loving homes.\nNeighbors A bought a necklace from Neighbors B's shop and loves it.\nNeighbors A got a necklace with a blue stone that matches well with work clothes.\nNeighbors A was looking for a new necklace and stumbled upon Neighbors B's shop.\nNeighbors A has an upcoming wedding and needs accessories, specifically earrings.\nNeighbors B has a great selection of earrings and is willing to help find the perfect match for the dress.\nNeighbors A has a picture of the dress on their phone and will show it to Neighbors B.\nNeighbors B thinks they have the perfect pair of earrings to complement the dress.\nNeighbors A struggled with apologizing and admitting when they are wrong.\nNeighbors B emphasized the importance of apologizing to show care for the relationship.\nNeighbors A made an insensitive comment to a coworker, leading to the need for an apology.\nNeighbors A is considering writing a letter to apologize to the coworker.\nNeighbors B offered to help Neighbors A with the apology process.\nBoth neighbors agreed that apologizing takes strength, not weakness.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nNeighbors A: It's great to have friends who can help each other out, isn't it? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nNeighbors B: Absolutely, I'm glad we can support each other. Let me see the picture of the dress you're thinking of wearing for the apology dinner.\nRESPONSE 2\nNeighbors B: Absolutely, it really is. It's important to have a support system you can rely on.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 recalls a memory regarding Neighbors A's need for accessories for an upcoming wedding, specifically finding the right earrings to match a dress and Neighbors B's willingness to help. This reflects the memorability criterion by tying back to the specific memory of the dress and earrings. However, it incorrectly associates the event with an \"apology dinner\" which does not match any of the past memories provided. \nResponse 2, on the other hand, acknowledges the general sentiment of supporting each other, which is consistent with the previous conversations about asking for advice, offering apologies, and the importance of friendships and support systems, but does not directly recall a past memory. \n\nOverall, even though Response 1 contains some inaccuracies in terms of events, it makes use of specific past memories more than Response 2, which is more general.\n\nChoice: 1"
