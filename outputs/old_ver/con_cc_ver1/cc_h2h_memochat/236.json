If you need to talk about it or vent more, I'm here to listen and support you.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses offer support and understanding to Neighbors A. However, neither response explicitly recalls past memories or references their shared experiences or mutual support in their neighborhood, which diminishes their memorability based on the criterion provided. The emphasis here is on the general offer of support rather than any specific past interactions. Both responses equally provide an empathetic and supportive response but lack specific reflection on past memories for memorability.\n\nChoice: tie"
