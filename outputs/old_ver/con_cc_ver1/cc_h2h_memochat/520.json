    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses offer emotional support to Neighbor A, but Response 2 more explicitly reflects their past shared experiences and support system.

This consideration of past interactions and Neighbor A's needs highlights the level of support Neighbor B offers based on their history together.\n\nChoice: 2"
