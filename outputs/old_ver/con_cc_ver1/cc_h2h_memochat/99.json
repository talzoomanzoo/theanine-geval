Thanks for asking!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 2 provides more memorability by explicitly recalling past memories related to sleep issues that Classmates A had, including the mention of the bedtime routine which likely aligns with Classmates B's past suggestion of meditation and breathing exercises. It shows that Classmates A has taken Classmates B's suggestions into account and is actively working on enhancing their sleep quality. This makes Response 2 more connected to the past conversations and shared experiences than Response 1, which generalizes the improvements without going into detail.\n\nChoice: 2"
