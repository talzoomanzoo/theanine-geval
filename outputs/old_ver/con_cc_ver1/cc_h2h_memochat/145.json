    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nNeighbor A has been living in the same place for a long time and enjoys the neighborhood and people there.\nNeighbor B has moved around a lot over the years but is considering settling down in the current neighborhood.\nNeighbor A and Neighbor B appreciate each other as good neighbors and have organized a block party together in the past.\nNeighbors A finds peace and happiness by spending time with God daily, through prayer, reading the Bible, and listening to worship music.\nNeighbors A believes this routine has brought positive changes, helping them stay focused, calm, and grateful.\nNeighbors B is interested in practicing gratitude and shifting their perspective towards positivity.\nNeighbors A enjoys living in the neighborhood, feeling comfortable and safe, and has made good friends, including Neighbors B.\nNeighbors A used to have power over Neighbors B, but no longer has it.\nNeighbors B used to obey Neighbors A's commands.\nNeighbors A finds spending time with God brings them peace and happiness.\nNeighbors A and B live in the same place and find comfort in it.\nNeighbors A values the relationship with Neighbors B and considers them like family.\nNeighbors A just moved to a new neighborhood and is getting to know the area.\nNeighbors B has been living in the neighborhood for some time and is supportive of Neighbors A.\nNeighbors A is excited to explore the neighborhood and make new friends.\nNeighbors A found a park and a coffee shop nearby that they want to visit.\nNeighbors B acknowledges Neighbors A's friendly and outgoing nature.\nNeighbors A appreciates having friendly faces around and hopes to make new friends soon.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nNeighbors A: I just visited this amazing new city. The architecture was stunning, the streets were so clean, and the people were very friendly.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like you had a great time! Which city did you visit?\nNeighbors A: It was Chicago. I had never been before, but it exceeded all my expectations.\nNeighbors B: I bet it was a nice change of scenery from our neighborhood.\nNeighbors A: Definitely. But you know, it's interesting how much our neighborhood has grown on me over the years. I remember when I first moved here, I was so unsure about it.\nNeighbors B: Yeah, I remember. But you stayed because you wanted to be here.\nNeighbors A: That's right. And since then, I've made so many great memories here. It's become my home.\nNeighbors B: And you're still spending time with God every day, right?\nNeighbors A: Yes, I am. It brings me so much peace and happiness.\nNeighbors B: That's really admirable. And speaking of power, I remember you telling me about that time when you could make me do anything you wanted. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nNeighbors A: Haha, yes, that was a fun memory! It's amazing how time flies, isn't it?\nRESPONSE 2\nNeighbors A: It seems like Neighbors B is referencing a previous conversation with Neighbors A about a time when Neighbors A had some influence or power over them. This could be a playful or humorous reference to a past interaction or discussion. Neighbors A could respond by acknowledging the memory and adding a light-hearted comment or continuing the conversation in a friendly manner.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses reflect on past memories related to the dynamic where Neighbor A used to have power over Neighbor B. However, Response 1 directly acknowledges the shared memory with a nostalgic tone, capturing the spirit of memorability better. It is concise, connects with the shared experience, and evokes a sense of time passing, which aligns with the past memories. Response 2, while mentioning the context of the memory, is more of an analysis rather than an actual response, and doesn't provide a direct reflection on the memory itself.\n\nChoice: 1"
