It's crucial to maintain professionalism and respect boundaries in the workplace. If you have concerns or need help, please feel free to discuss them with HR or a supervisor.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither of the responses directly recall past memories. However, Response 2 is more aligned with previous behaviors and actions mentioned in past memories such as Co-worker A intervening to stop fights, talking to police, and behaving bravely and ethically. Co-worker A is demonstrated to be someone who is concerned about safety and doing the right thing, suggesting response 2 is more in line with their character. The discussion on boundaries and professionalism also echoes the supportive nature Co-worker B showed to Co-worker A in their recovery and admiration for doing the right thing. In contrast, response 1 seems dismissive and doesn't reflect the seriousness Co-worker A and B usually presented in such situations.\n\nChoice: 2"
