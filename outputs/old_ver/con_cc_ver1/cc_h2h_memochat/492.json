    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nClassmates A got grounded for a week for kicking a door and causing damage.\nClassmates B emphasizes the consequences of Classmates A's actions and the need for responsibility.\nClassmates A acknowledges the mistake and plans to learn from it.\nClassmates B mentions a past incident where they had to clean up spilled paint, highlighting the importance of learning from mistakes.\nBoth classmates have experienced making mistakes and learning from them.\nClassmates A and Sasha are friends who haven't caught up in a long time.\nClassmates A is interested in dance and asked Sasha for some dance tips.\nClassmates B and Classmates A used to dance a lot in middle school.\nClassmates A once kicked a door in and got grounded for a week because of it.\nClassmates A is considering taking a dance class for fun.\nClassmate A is going through a tough time at home due to their parents fighting.\nClassmate B is a supportive friend who listens and offers to help.\nClassmate A appreciates having friends who are there for them during difficult times.\nClassmate A mentioned going to a club to see Sasha dance, indicating a social aspect to their friendship dynamic.\nClassmates A and Classmates B are friends who help each other with schoolwork.\nClassmates A made a mistake in the past by kicking a door in and getting grounded.\nClassmates A has matured since then and learned from past mistakes.\nClassmates B supported Classmates A through a tough time by listening to them.\nClassmates B went to a club to see Sasha dance and did not get in trouble, showing maturity.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nClassmates A: I just finished my computer course, and I learned so much about using computers effectively.\nClassmates B: That's great! What did you learn specifically?\nClassmates A: Oh, a lot of things. I learned how to use different programs and software for different tasks, and how to choose the right one depending on what I need to do.\nClassmates B: Do you have any software recommendations for me? I always struggle with choosing the right program.\nClassmates A: It really depends on what you need the software for. But for basic tasks like word processing or spreadsheet management, I would recommend Microsoft Office. It's user-friendly and versatile.\nClassmates B: Thanks, I'll keep that in mind. Did you learn anything else in the course? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nClassmates A: I also learned about computer security and the importance of keeping my devices and information safe. It was pretty eye-opening.\nRESPONSE 2\nClassmates A: It seems like you had a great experience in your computer course! Learning about different programs and software must have been interesting. Is there anything specific you would like to share or ask about the course content or your experience with it?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 does not recall or reflect on any of the past memories. It continues the conversation about the computer course by adding information about learning computer security, but it does not connect to any shared past experiences or prior interactions between Classmates A and B. \n\nResponse 2 acknowledges Classmates A's learning experience and opens the door for further discussion, which could possibly lead to sharing personal reflections or tying into past experiences about learning and growth. However, it does not directly recall or reflect on any of the specific past memories provided.\n\nSince neither response strongly reflects past memories, they are relatively equal in terms of memorability.\n\nChoice: tie"
