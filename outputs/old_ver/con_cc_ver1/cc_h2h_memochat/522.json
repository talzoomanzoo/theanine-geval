I thought we were happy together.\nNeighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left?\nNeighbors A: No, I haven't. I don't even know what I would say to him. I feel like I'm not enough, like I wasn't good enough for him.\nNeighbors B: That's not true, Neighbor A. You are an amazing person and you deserve someone who appreciates you for who you are.\nNeighbors A: I just feel so lost right now. I don't know how to move on from this. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nNeighbors B: I understand, Neighbor A. It's okay to feel lost after a breakup. Just take it one day at a time, and remember that you're not alone in this.\nRESPONSE 2\nNeighbors B: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling lost, Neighbor A. It's important to take things one step at a time and give yourself time to heal. Would you like to talk more about what you're going through, or is there anything specific that's been on your mind?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses do not immediately recall specific past memories, but response 1 subtly reflects past supportive interactions. Neighbor B's message conveys ongoing support, which is consistent with past memories where Neighbor B has been a source of companionship and understanding for Neighbor A. In addition, response 1 reiterates the theme of companionship (\"you're not alone in this\"), which is linked to shared past experiences of support, including during difficult times such as Neighbor A's grief over their grandmother. Response 2, while supportive, does not as strongly reflect these specific past themes of companionship and assurance.\n\nChoice: 1"
