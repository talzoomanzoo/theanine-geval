    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses indicate Neighbors B is open to receiving a secret, both involve offering support. However, \"Response 2\" adds a layer of encouragement by saying \"I'm here for you.\" This can be linked back to Neighbor Bâ€™s consistent supportiveness, as seen when they suggested new skills leading to new opportunities and expressed excitement over Neighbor A's telekinesis. This reflects past memories better by reinforcing the supportive nature of Neighbors B.\n\nChoice: 2"
