    "prediction": "Explanation: The responses required to address the issue raised in the conversation do not directly correlate with past memories. However, Response 2 makes a direct reference to \"related evidences\" and offers to discuss topics like career aspirations and encouragement, which links back to past memories of Classmates A's passion for biology and science. As Response 1 doesn't attempt to tie back to any past shared memories or the established relationship, Response 2, although slightly off-topic, makes a better attempt to recall past conversations around career aspirations.\n\nChoice: 2"
