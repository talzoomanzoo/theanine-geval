    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response directly references past memories, but Response 2 ties back to the ongoing conversation about language studies and also acknowledges the student's interest in multiple languages, which was previously mentioned. Response 1 focuses more on future travel and immersion, which does not relate to any specific memory. Therefore, Response 2, by aligning with the student's language learning journey and aspirations, better reflects the ongoing theme and can be considered more memorable in the context of the conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
