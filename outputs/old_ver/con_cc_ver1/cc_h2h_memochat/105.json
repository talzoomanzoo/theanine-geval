    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nMemorability - The response should properly recall past memories when needed. Higher reflection of past memories indicates higher Memorability.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Memorability given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nNeighbors A and B are observing wood that appears to be freshly cut from a tree.\nNeighbors A and B discuss the possibility of someone in the neighborhood using the wood for a project.\nNeighbors A recalls a previous storm that caused trees to fall down, leading to the availability of wood for projects.\nNeighbors A and B appreciate the resourcefulness of using fallen trees for firewood or other purposes.\nNeighbors A and B emphasize the importance of taking care of trees and the environment for future generations.\nNeighbor A apologized to Neighbor B for their behavior and expressed a desire to make amends.\nNeighbor B accepted Neighbor A's apology and mentioned that it was hurtful to be treated that way.\nNeighbor A values their friendship with Neighbor B and wants to ensure it remains strong.\nNeighbor A noticed some wood near their backyard and asked Neighbor B if they had seen it too.\nNeighbor B suggested that the wood may be leftover from city tree trimming activities.\nNeighbors A forgot their backpack at home before going to school.\nNeighbors A stayed up all night studying for a test and feels terrible about forgetting the backpack.\nNeighbors A did not bring any notes or textbooks to school.\nNeighbors B suggests talking to the teacher to see if Neighbors A can take the test another day.\nNeighbors A feels like they should have been more prepared for the test.\nNeighbors B reminds Neighbors A about taking responsibility for their mistakes in the past and learning from them.\nNeighbors B offers help and support to Neighbors A in the situation.\nNeighbors A is good at fixing things, particularly electronics.\nNeighbors B appreciates Neighbors A's handy skills.\nNeighbors A left their backpack at home once and had to borrow notes from a classmate.\nNeighbors A values double-checking before leaving the house.\nNeighbors A apologized to Neighbors B for their behavior and admitted to being wrong.\nNeighbors A and B were able to resolve their issues and maintain a friendly relationship.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, have you noticed how strong I've become?\nNeighbors B: Wow, you do look very strong! Have you been working out? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nNeighbors A: Yes, I've been hitting the gym regularly. It feels good to stay active.\nRESPONSE 2\nNeighbors A: Thanks! Yes, I've been hitting the gym regularly. It feels great to see the progress.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both response options focus on Neighbor A discussing their progress from working out, but neither response directly recalls past memories such as the conversations about wood, environmental responsibility, previous apologies, or school-related discussions. However, Response 2 includes an additional element of reflection by mentioning \"seeing the progress,\" which can be indirectly linked to the idea of progress and self-improvement seen in their past interaction where they resolved an issue after an apology. This slight reflection on progress makes Response 2 marginally more aligned with past behaviors and memorable incidents than Response 1.\n\nChoice: 2"
