    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses emphasize the importance of communication, collaboration, and valuing different perspectives, which align with the past memories reflecting Co-worker A and B's relationship. However, Response 1 specifically mentions \"open communication\" and \"consider different perspectives,\" directly recalling the past memory where both value communication, understanding, and working well with others. Response 2 maintains a general support for being open-minded but does not explicitly reference the historical emphasis on communication as much as Response 1 does.\n\nChoice: 1"
