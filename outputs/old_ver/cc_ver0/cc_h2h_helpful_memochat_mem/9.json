    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides information about Classmates A's career interests, specifically about business and singing, which are separate from carpentry. These provide context about Classmates A's ambitions and supportive interactions from Classmates B, though they are not directly relevant to the topic of carpentry. MEMORY 2 also primarily addresses Classmate A's singing aspirations and does not give insight into Classmate A's journey into carpentry, making it similarly less useful for answering how Classmates A got into carpentry. MEMORY 1 is slightly more versatile as it mentions hard work and learning new strategies, which could tie to a learning journey similar to carpentry.\n\nChoice: 1"
