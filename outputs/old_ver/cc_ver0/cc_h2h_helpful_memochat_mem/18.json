    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains information about Neighbors B's supportive nature towards Neighbors A, including past support for career change, which ties in with the dialogue context where Neighbors A reflects on their newfound freedom after changing jobs. This background helps Neighbors B respond with empathy and understanding to the life change A is experiencing as a millionaire. MEMORY 2 mainly recounts a conversation about job dissatisfaction and career change, which is somewhat relevant but lacks the broader supportive dynamic provided in MEMORY 1.\n\nChoice: 1"
