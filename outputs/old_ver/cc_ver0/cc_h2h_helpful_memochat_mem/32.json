    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 focuses more on traits such as resilience, quick thinking, and giving effort, which while valuable, are not directly related to the current context of embarrassing experiences and the subsequent support. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, is centered on past experiences and the importance of support, directly mirroring the supportive tone in Classmates A's reassurance about handling embarrassing situations, akin to their own experience.\n\nChoice: 2"
