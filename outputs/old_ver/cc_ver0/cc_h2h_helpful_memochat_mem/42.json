But I couldn't help but feel intrigued by her. Maybe she was a witch or something. ### Classmates B: Well, that's a bit far-fetched. Maybe she just likes to dress eccentrically. Did she do anything else? ### Classmates A: No, she just stood there for a moment, and then walked away. But I can't shake off my curiosity about her. ### Classmates B: Well, I wouldn't go wandering around dark alleys anymore. It's not safe. You know, you always seem to be drawn to unusual things. ### Classmates A: Maybe, but isn't life all about exploring new things and taking risks? Anyway, do you remember when we talked about making a difference in the world?

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a context for a mysterious encounter that Classmates A had, which suggests that Classmates B might have learned about Classmates A's past or other secrets through observation of potentially risky behavior. This ties into the theme of being drawn to unusual experiences and may hint at how Classmates B came to know something about Classmates A's past. It is directly relevant to the current dialogue about secrets and disclosure. \n\nMEMORY 1, on the other hand, focuses on Classmates A's positivity and intentions when transferring to the school, which does not provide direct insight into the current conversation about secrets or how Classmates B may have acquired their information. \n\nChoice: 2"
