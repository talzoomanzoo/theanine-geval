I'm really looking forward to it.\nHusband: Great. I'll start looking for rental cabins right away. I know this may sound impulsive, but I'm really excited to make this happen.\nWife: Don't worry, husband, it's not impulsive. You always follow through with your plans, and I believe this will be a wonderful experience for both of us.\nHusband: Thank you, wife. And, I want to apologize for the time I left without waiting for you. I know I promised to wait, and I should have kept my word. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nThe husband's excitement about his long-awaited plans drives him to take action and involve his wife in future plans. The wife expresses her past disappointment when the husband left without her, emphasizing the importance of keeping promises. The husband's dedication to his plans excites him, and both husband and wife are looking forward to their future together.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nHusband is driven and motivated to achieve his dreams, putting all his effort into making them a reality.

Despite a misstep, Husband and Wife enjoyed a dance together and are looking forward to their future together. They appreciate each other's love and support, inspiring each other to achieve more and make their dreams come true.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories provide information about the husband's personality and the nature of the relationship between the husband and wife. However, MEMORY 1 is more relevant and directly helpful because it specifically addresses the husband's apology for leaving without waiting for the wife, which directly relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where he is apologizing. It ties the past incident to their present relationship dynamics and the current conversation. MEMORY 2, while it does provide a general sense of their relationship, includes details that are not directly relevant to the current conversation, such as stopping a runaway carriage, and lacks the specific context of the earlier promise broken by the husband.\n\nChoice: 1"
