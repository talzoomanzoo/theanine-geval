    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context revolves around Neighbor A feeling overwhelmed and stressed out. Memory 2 contains a description of the supportive relationship between Neighbors A and B, specifically mentioning that Neighbor B offers support during stressful times. This directly relates to the current feelings of Neighbor A and would allow Neighbor B to offer empathy and assistance. Memory 1, while mentioning Neighbor A feeling overwhelmed, lacks the context of the supportive relationship that Memory 2 provides, thus making it less helpful in enabling Neighbor B to respond appropriately.\n\nChoice: 2"
