    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 provides a direct reference to the Mentee's experience moving to a new city for a job, which is relevant to their expressed feelings of loneliness. It shows that the Mentor has a history of offering reassurance, which could be useful for responding to the Mentee's current situation. Memory 2, while describing the Mentee as accomplished and including details from their past, does not directly address the context of loneliness in a new city. Thus, Memory 1 is more helpful as it contains specific relevant experience that the Mentor can draw from in responding to the Mentee's feelings.\n\nChoice: 1"
