    "prediction": "Explanation: In the dialogue context, Classmates B asked Classmates A how they got into carpentry. This requires information regarding Classmates A's journey or experience related to carpentry. MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 both provide some insights into Classmates A's interests and endeavors outside of carpentry but don't specifically address Classmates A's path into carpentry. However, MEMORY 2 contains more details about relationships and potential collaboration between the classmates, which could translate into understanding Classmates A's motivations and background, albeit indirectly. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, mentions Classmate A's enjoyment of singing, which is not directly related to the carpentry context. Overall, neither MEMORY directly answers the question about how Classmates A got into carpentry, but MEMORY 2 provides a broader context for Classmates A's ambitions and motivations, which could be considered a bit more useful.\n\nChoice: 2"
