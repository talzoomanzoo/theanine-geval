I was promoted to product manager!\nCo-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge.\nCo-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail.\nCo-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of new products, remember when you used to fantasize about being a great leader?\nCo-workers A: Ha, yeah. That seems like ages ago.\nCo-workers B: Well, now you can finally take on that leadership role and make your dreams a reality.\nCo-workers A: That's true. It's amazing how life works out sometimes. But it hasn't always been smooth sailing. Remember when I was really stressed about you not liking me? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. [Co-worker A used to fantasize about being a great leader and being respected and admired.] - (SameTopic) - [Co-worker A has aspirations of being a great leader and emphasizes the importance of communication.]\n2. [Co-worker A has fantasies of being a great leader.] - (SameTopic) - [Co-worker A felt stressed about their relationship with Co-worker B in the past.] - (Causes) - [Co-worker B advises Co-worker A to control their emotions and discuss the issue with Co-worker B.]\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Co-worker A used to fantasize about being a great leader and being respected and admired.\n2. Co-worker A has fantasies of being a great leader.\n3. Co-worker A has grown and become more confident over the years.\n4. Co-worker A considers taking on more responsibility at work as a start towards being a leader.\n5. Co-worker A has aspirations of being a great leader and emphasizes the importance of communication.\n6. Co-worker B acknowledges and supports Co-worker A's growth and progress.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 contains the information about Co-worker A's past aspirations of being a leader and their growth and increased confidence over the years. It also mentions Co-worker B's support and acknowledgment of Co-worker A's progress, which provides a broader context of their relationship and development. This is relevant to the dialogue where Co-worker A is reflecting on their past stress about their relationship with Co-worker B, and it helps Co-worker B address these concerns with affirmation, potentially reducing any lingering stress for Co-worker A. MEMORY 1, however, focuses on a specific past issue related to emotional management and communication advice, which, while relevant, isn't as holistic or supportive in this context as the positive reinforcement offered in MEMORY 2.\n\nChoice: 2"
