It directly aligns with the conversation and assists Neighbors A to respond in context. On the other hand, MEMORY 1 contains extraneous information about trees and environmental issues that doesn't directly relate to the dialogue context or add helpful context for a response about personal responsibility.\n\nChoice: 2"
