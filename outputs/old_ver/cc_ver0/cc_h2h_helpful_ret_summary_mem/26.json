    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, how's it going?\nNeighbors B: Not bad, thanks. How about you?\nNeighbors A: Oh, I'm doing alright. I was just thinking about the old days when I had my rock band.\nNeighbors B: Really?

What kind of music did you guys play?\nNeighbors A: We played rock music, mostly covers but we also wrote some of our own songs.\nNeighbors B: Have you ever thought about starting the band again? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- Neighbor A offered to provide the name of their chiropractor to Neighbor B if they decide to go. Neighbor A and Neighbor B enjoy playing together with toys. Neighbor B is familiar with Neighbor A's dog and looking forward to playing with it again. Neighbor A appreciated the support and friendship of Neighbor B.\n- Neighbor B is interested in chiropractic care after hearing about Neighbor A's positive experience.

Neighbors B expresses concern for Neighbors A's back pain.\n6. Neighbor B is interested in chiropractic care after hearing about Neighbor A's positive experience.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is centered around Neighbor A's rock band and its potential revival. The previous memories do not directly relate to this musical theme, but helpful information could involve past experiences, shared interests, or future plans that might relate to starting a band again, such as playing music together. MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 focus on unrelated topics like chiropractic care and playing with toys, which do not directly tie into the dialogue topic about the rock band. However, given the absence of directly relevant information, we must choose based on the closest relevance and utility. MEMORY 1 mentions that Neighbor A recently moved and dealt with stress, a tangential detail that could somewhat relate to 'starting anew' themes like reviving a band, while MEMORY 2 does not.\n\nChoice: 1"
