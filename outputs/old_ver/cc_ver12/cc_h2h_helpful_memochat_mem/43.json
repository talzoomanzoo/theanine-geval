Neighbor A appreciates the emotional support and understanding from Neighbor B during their time of grief.\nNeighbor A and Neighbor B are neighbors who catch up outside of their neighborhood. Neighbors A and Neighbors B like to grab a bite to eat together after their activities. Neighbor B is offering support and companionship to Neighbor A during their difficult time.\nNeighbor A has a bit of a drive to get to the park where they are meeting with Neighbor B. Neighbors A and Neighbors B enjoy going for walks together, especially to the park. Neighbor A finds solace in nature and believes that it helps in coping with their emotions.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 is more helpful because it contains a specific past dialogue where Neighbors A and B discussed dealing with loss and emotions, and they used a walk to help cope with the situation. This mirrors the current context where Neighbor A is dealing with an emotional breakup and might find comfort in doing something similar. MEMORY 2 is less specific about dealing with past emotional hardships but rather gives background context on activities and the nature of the relationship between the neighbors. Such generic context is less immediately useful for a targeted response to the current situation.\n\nChoice: 1"
