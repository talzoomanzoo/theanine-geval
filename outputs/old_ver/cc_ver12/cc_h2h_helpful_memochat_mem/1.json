The SAT is next month and I don't feel ready. ### Mentor: Have you been studying consistently? ### Mentee: Yes, but it feels like there's so much material to cover. ### Mentor: Remember to break it down into manageable chunks.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 discusses topics related to college application stress, which is not directly relevant to the mentee's current feeling of loneliness in a new city. The focus of MEMORY 1 is more academic and stress-related, which would be helpful in situations where the mentee is overwhelmed by work or studies. On the other hand, MEMORY 2 provides information about the mentee's past decision-making process and mentions that they have recently moved to a new city, leading to them feeling overwhelmed and ultimately accepting a job offer there. This gives relevant background related to the loneliness they are experiencing, such as moving to a new city, which can help the Mentor provide better emotional support.\n\nChoice: 2"
