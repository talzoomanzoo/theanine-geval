    "prediction": "Explanation: The mentee is currently feeling lonely in a new city and misses their old friends. Helpful context would include information that pertains to their recent relocation, feelings of loneliness, or anything that might assist the mentor in addressing these emotions.\n\nMEMORY 1 contains information about the mentee being overwhelmed with college applications, a decision about taking a job in a city, gratitude, making things right at a store, and stress over the SAT. Specifically, the detail about taking a job in the city could relate to the mentee's current feelings of loneliness after relocating, making it somewhat helpful.\n\nMEMORY 2 also discusses the mentee's decision to take a job in the city after mentor support, which is relevant to their relocation and current feelings of loneliness. However, much of the remaining content in MEMORY 2 merges unrelated issues, making it less focused.\n\nUltimately, both memories have relevant pieces, but the first memory more directly addresses the current context of the mentee taking a job in the city, which aligns with their challenges of settling into a new environment.\n\nChoice: 1"
