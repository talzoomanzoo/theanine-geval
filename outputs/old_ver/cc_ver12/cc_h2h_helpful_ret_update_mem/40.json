    "prediction": "Explanation: The current dialogue context involves Classmates B asking for software recommendations from Classmates A. Therefore, the most helpful memory would be one that contains information about Classmates A's knowledge or interest in computer programs or software, which neither memory sufficiently provides. However, MEMORY 1 focuses on the supportive nature and friendship between Classmates A and B, making it slightly more relevant than MEMORY 2, which elaborates on consequences and unrelated details such as dancing.\n\nChoice: 1"
