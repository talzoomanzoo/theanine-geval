    "prediction": "Explanation: Both MEMORIES mention Neighbors A's enjoyment of cooking and a specific dish they made, which could relate to the idea of trying out new restaurants but is not directly relevant to the conversation about work. However, MEMORY 2 provides additional context about discussions regarding skills and new opportunities in a job or career, which is directly relevant to Neighbor B's question about how Neighbors A feels about their job. This makes MEMORY 2 more useful and relevant to the current dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 2"
