It's an important skill to have in life.\nChild: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you.\nParent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you.\nChild: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations.\n2. The child is supportive and caring towards the parent.\n3. The child offers help and reassurance to the parent.\n4. Both the parent and child express love and support for each other.\n5. The child is supportive and proud of their parent for making changes.\n6. The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n- The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations, which causes them to mention making mistakes in the past and trying to turn their life around.\n- The Parent and Child plan to watch the sunrise together in the future, and the parent suggests repeating the sunrise-watching tradition on a future weekend.\n- The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring and is supportive and proud of their parent for making changes, offering help and reassurance if needed.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The key point made by the Child in the last utterance is regarding the Parent's possible feeling of not being listened to during a challenging time (in detention). The Parent's mentions of past mistakes and efforts to turn their life around in Memory 2 are directly relevant, allowing the Parent to relate to what the Child identified without veering off-topic. Memory 1, while showing the supportive relationship between Parent and Child, lacks any reference to the Parent's past experiences, reducing its direct relevance to the conversation about detention.\n\nChoice: 2"
