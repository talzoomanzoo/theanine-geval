    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for.\nSpeaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for?\nSpeaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\nSpeaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise? \nSpeaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows.\nSpeaker A: That sounds wonderful! You'd get to just be out in nature all day. Sounds like a great job, especially if you're a bit introverted like me. That's why hiking is my favorite -- a good solitary activity. \nSpeaker B: Yes, I agree. What kind of hours would this new job have?\nSpeaker A: It's third shift, which isn't the greatest, but it pays a bit more than the other shifts, and I think I'll like getting off early in the morning. Then I can just go down and get in my hammock and have a nice relaxing moment after work. \nSpeaker B: Would you feel safe being out there all alone, possibly falling asleep? That just sounds a bit risky. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking, mentioning setting up a hammock at their campsite.\n3. Speaker B enjoys camping, hiking, and is kind, caring, and hopeful for group equality.\n4. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n5. Speaker A has a portable hammock for the hike and asks if Speaker B will bring theirs.\n6. Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nSpeaker B enjoys camping, hiking, and is kind, caring, and hopeful for group equality. Speaker A plans to potentially visit the Columbia Trail and Ken Lockwood Gorge for a camping and hiking trip. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n\nSpeaker B enjoys camping, hiking, and is kind, caring, and hopeful for group equality. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking, mentioning setting up a hammock at their campsite. Speaker A and Speaker B have gone hiking together before and plan to meet up for another hike. Speaker A suggests bringing water for the hike and mentions having a picnic at the top of the mountain.\n\nSpeaker A does not care about voting and plans to send their parents a postcard. Speaker A is looking for a job and new camping gear, specifically a hammock. Speaker A will use the money earned from the store to buy the hammock online.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves Speaker B expressing concern about Speaker A's safety when using a hammock alone after their night shift. Any MEMORY that includes information about the location of the hammock setup or discusses safety, camping, or related outdoor activities would be relevant. \n\nChoice 1 mentions Speaker A's enjoyment of camping and hiking, and mentions Speaker A having a hammock, which relates to the dialogue about potentially relaxing in a hammock after a shift. It also aligns with the discussion around the grocery store location being near a hiking trail, which could be related to where Speaker A might set up their hammock.\n\nChoice 2, while including informative details about Speaker A's camping plans and enjoyment of hiking, largely adds context that hasn't been part of the immediate conversation, such as specific trips and the additional option of visiting places like the Columbia Trail and Ken Lockwood Gorge or planning another hike with Speaker B. It doesn't specifically address the safety concern or the current setting post-night shift, which were pivotal in Speaker B's concern.\n\nTherefore, MEMORY 1 is more directly aligned with the context and interest in Speaker A's post-shift hammock use.\n\nChoice: 1"
