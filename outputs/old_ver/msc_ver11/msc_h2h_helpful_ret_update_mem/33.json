    "prediction": "Explanation: The relevant part of the dialogue context is that Speaker A is asking for game suggestions besides scary games like Resident Evil. They mention liking everything but scary games and are indecisive about what to play next. MEMORY 1 mentions that Speaker A prefers tamer video games and isn't a fan of horror movies, which is directly relevant to Speaker A's gaming preference. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, repeats this information but also includes a lot of repetitive and less relevant details about Speaker B's gaming habits, which do not directly help in providing game suggestions to Speaker A.\n\nChoice: 1"
