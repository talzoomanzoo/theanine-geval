Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n3. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n4. Speaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\n5. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n6. Speaker A is involved with a football league and is looking forward to playing games.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science, and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics. \nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities. \nSpeaker B majoring in linguistics causes Speaker A to be interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue revolves around both Speaker A's interest in teaching robotics and Speaker B's consideration of teaching in linguistics. While both memories contain relevant information, Memory 1 provides specific context about Speaker B's current engagement in education (such as volunteering for educational programs), which aligns with their current consideration of teaching and makes it more helpful to the conversation. Additionally, Memory 1 includes Speaker A's continued interest in robotics, which directly connects to the dialogue and makes it more relevant overall. Memory 2, while informative, contains repetitive information and lacks the additional context provided in Memory 1.\n\nChoice: 1"
