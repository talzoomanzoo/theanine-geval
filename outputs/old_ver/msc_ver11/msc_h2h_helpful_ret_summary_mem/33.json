    "prediction": "Explanation: Speaker A is asking for suggestions on games to play that aren't scary. Both memories mention that Speaker A is hesitant to try Resident Evil and prefers tamer video games, which is useful information to keep in mind when suggesting a game. However, Memory 1 provides additional context on game preferences, mentioning specifically that Speaker A enjoys Jurassic Park: World. This information is more directly relevant and useful when making game suggestions than the broader context provided in Memory 2. Memory 1 also more directly addresses Speaker B's activities related to Resident Evil, which is connected to the conversation topic.\n\nChoice: 1"
