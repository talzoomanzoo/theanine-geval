MEMORY 1 contains specific information about Speaker B's oldest nephew, who is about to turn 14, which is directly relevant to the current question from Speaker A. MEMORY 2 also contains this information but adds details about Speaker A's grandchildren and blue hair that are irrelevant to the immediate inquiry about the nephew.\n\nChoice: 1"
