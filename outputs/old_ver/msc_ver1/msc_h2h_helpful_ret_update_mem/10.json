    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok? \nSpeaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish?\nSpeaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus!\nSpeaker B: Oh that sounds absolutely fabulous. Are you going to get a free dessert, as well? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods. Speaker A owns a restaurant and recently experienced a fire incident but managed to put it out.\n2. Speaker A enjoys the interaction with people at work and the variety of experiences that come with it. Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule.\n3. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit. Speaker A's schedule at the restaurant includes working doubles on Saturdays and 8-hour shifts on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n2. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n3. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n4. Speaker B loves the beach and Mediterranean food.\n5. Speaker A's schedule at the restaurant includes working doubles on Saturdays and 8-hour shifts on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.\n6. Speaker A is an omnivore.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context revolves around Speaker A's job at a restaurant and the excitement over trying a new dish. Speaker B inquires about the possibility of getting a free dessert. The most helpful memory would provide information on any perks or benefits related to food at the restaurant, since Speaker B is curious about the free food options available to Speaker A.\n\nIn MEMORY 1, Item 1 mentions that Speaker A gets two free meals per week and can take home leftover baked goods. This is directly relevant to the question about free dessert. Other parts of MEMORY 1 provide context about working at the restaurant but don't mention specifically about desserts or free meals.\n\nSimilarly, MEMORY 2 Item 1 provides the same relevant information regarding free meals and taking home leftover baked goods. However, MEMORY 2 also contains additional information that is less relevant to the specific question about dessert, like Speaker Bâ€™s love for the beach and Mediterranean food, or the fact that Speaker A is an omnivore.\n\nBoth memories provide the same critical information regarding free meals which directly relates to the possibility of free dessert, but MEMORY 2 includes more unhelpful information in this specific context.\n\nChoice: 1"
