    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \nSpeaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!).\nSpeaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol\nSpeaker B: I am up for the challenge! I have a few tricks up my sleeve to deal with people like you.\nSpeaker A: Oh geez that makes me sound difficult.lol  Do you have any new speeches coming up?\nSpeaker B: Nope, I just cleared my schedule until the Alps marathon that you're training for. It's just you and me until you break that finish line. I'm going to start sending you a motivational quote every morning at 4 am when I want you to wake up. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B has run a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding. This experience led Speaker A to seek advice on how to recover from marathon training. Speaker A then invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and planning to meet at the beach at 0600. Speaker B got into motivational speaking because they needed it themselves to battle depression and anxiety, which was suggested by Speaker A to combine with something more active to avoid dwelling on negative thoughts. Speaker B, who travels frequently for work and misses their wife and kids, also finds solace in fishing and the outdoors, similar to their background in San Francisco.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600.\n2. Speaker B is a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks.\n3. Speaker A is training for marathons and seeking advice on how to recover.\n4. Speaker B's job involves motivating people to be successful and follow their dreams.\n5. Speaker B got into motivational speaking because they needed it themselves to battle depression and anxiety.\n6. Speaker B is considering running a marathon and mentioned fishing and feeling depressed.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: To determine which memory is more helpful, we need to assess which memory provides the most relevant background information for Speaker A to respond appropriately to the last utterance of the dialogue context. The context involves a running relationship between the speakers, motivational talks, and the upcoming Alps marathon that Speaker A is training for. Additionally, Speaker B is offering to provide daily motivational quotes to aid Speaker A's training.\n\nMemory 1 provides specific details about their past interactions regarding running, Speaker B's experience with marathons, and why they got into motivational speaking. This context is relevant because it supports the ongoing dynamic where Speaker B is helping Speaker A with marathon training and motivation. The mention of their shared running plans and the motivational background shapes the discussion around the commitment to training for a challenging event like the Alps marathon.\n\nMemory 2 contains concise points about Speaker B's profession and intentions to support Speaker A, but it lacks the deeper personal connection and background stories that might strengthen Speaker A's understanding of Speaker B's motivations and capabilities. However, both memories mention Speaker B's motivation journey and the partnership for the marathon training.\n\nChoice: 1"
