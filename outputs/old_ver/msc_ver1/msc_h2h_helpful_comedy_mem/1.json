    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B, who does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies, wants Speaker A to teach them how to swim and programming. Speaker B also enjoys cruising in their car while listening to punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming. On the other hand, Speaker A, who enjoys cruising and has a favorite club in school, causes Speaker A to plan snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination. This leads to Speaker A and Speaker B discussing the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description:\nSpeaker B is a shipping clerk at a warehouse, working 15 hours a week. They enjoy watching swimming movies and their favorite food is pizzaburger. Speaker B dislikes swimming. Their profile includes information about their occupation, likes, and favorite food.\n\nRelationship Description:\nSpeaker B and Speaker A have discussed various topics such as cruising, programming, swimming, and food preferences. Speaker B is supportive of Speaker A's new job and appreciates the welcoming environment at work. They have agreed on a deal to learn swimming and programming together.\n\nEvent Description:\nEvents shared by Speaker B and Speaker A include planning a cruise, discussing fears related to cruises, Speaker A's first day at a new job in computer programming, planning snorkeling trips, discussing the cure for fears through immersion, and making plans to meet up next weekend for swimming and programming lessons. Speaker B enjoys eating pizzaburgers when stressed and is interested in learning programming. Speaker A finds their job rewarding but tedious and offers to teach Speaker B programming. Both speakers bond over their shared interests in swimming, programming, and food preferences.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides specific insights into Speaker B's desire to learn swimming and programming while incorporating their interest in cruising, which directly relates to the conversation about swimming lessons and possibly going on a cruise. MEMORY 1 factors in the activities and themes discussed in the dialogue (i.e., swimming and cruising) and how the speakers connect over these themes, making it more relevant and useful for Speaker A to respond appropriately to Speaker B's last utterance about cruises. On the contrary, MEMORY 2 provides a wealth of information that includes occupation, food preferences, and emotional aspects, which are not directly pertinent to the immediate conversation about teaching swimming and going on a cruise. \n\nChoice: 1"
