    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her?\nSpeaker B: Hi there, hope you are wlll and managing to save up for your Italy trip?  Thank for asking about the Greek mythology study, we are doing very well. It helps because i am so passionate about it and hope to get to the Greek islands soon\nSpeaker A: Yes I have been saving up for another trip to Italy! I can't wait. It's planned for next Spring. Do you have any plans to go back to Italy in the future?\nSpeaker B: I would love to get back to Italy but need to save up and the hopeful priority is to Greece this year.  You have friends in Europe are you in contact to see what plans you can make?\nSpeaker A: Yes I've been talking to them quite a bit so they know what's going on. I'll be staying with some of them while I'm over there. I have never been to Greece....I'd like to go though. Maybe I'll add it to my itinerary! Maybe we could plan to be in Greece at the same time?!\nSpeaker B: That would be so good.  There is so much history and the roman statues i take my daughter to see in the museums and through our local resources is fab.  She is building up the passion which is lovely to see.  Have you still got your hair blue or has it grown out now?\nSpeaker A: That's awesome! Maybe you can teach me a little about all the mythology. I think I've never liked it before only because I didn't understand it. My hair is back to being its natural brown - lol I'm being boring for the moment.\nSpeaker B: Never boring you will keep styling it all sorts of interesting styles im sure.  Yes i would be lovely to be your guide for the day out in Greece.  Bring some decent walking boots and some sun cream, its a different heat out there but your tan is probably topped up with going to the beach each day.\nSpeaker A: That's good advice! Thank you! I saw on the news Cali has been getting a lot of rain. Have you still been able to run on the beach each day? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B has been to Italy in the past and enjoyed the food there, while Speaker A is fascinated by the architecture of Italy and enjoys studying history, especially through reading and watching documentaries.\n\nSpeaker A is planning to travel to Italy alone for Spring Break and has friends from Europe meeting up with them, while Speaker B does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology. Speaker B appreciates the idea of superhuman powers and is interested in historical events that involve such figures.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology.\n2. Speaker A is fascinated by the architecture of Italy and enjoys studying history, especially through reading and watching documentaries.\n3. Speaker A is planning to travel to Italy alone for Spring Break and has friends from Europe meeting up with them.\n4. Speaker B has been to Italy in the past and enjoyed the food there.\n5. Speaker B enjoys Greek mythology and did a case study on Poseidon, the God of the Sea, Earthquakes, and Horses.\n6. Speaker B goes to the beach everyday if possible, with their 5-year-old daughter who loves to swim and play in the sand.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context focuses on Speaker B's interest in Greece and Greek mythology, as well as a question from Speaker A about Speaker B's beach running routine despite California's rain. MEMORY 2 provides extra relevant detail that Speaker B goes to the beach every day if possible, which directly connects to Speaker A's question about exercising on the beach given the weather conditions. This specific information about beach-going with their daughter is likely to be pertinent to Speaker B's next response. MEMORY 1 doesn't offer this level of specificity regarding Speaker B's beach routine.\n\nChoice: 2"
