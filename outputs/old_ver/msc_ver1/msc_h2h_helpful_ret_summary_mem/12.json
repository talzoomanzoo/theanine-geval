    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science, and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics. \nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities. \nSpeaker B majoring in linguistics causes Speaker A to be interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\n3. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n4. Speaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\n5. Speaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\n6. Speaker A is studying computer science and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories provide relevant information to the conversation, but MEMORY 2 offers more concise and structured facts which directly relate to the current Dialogue Context. Particularly, it clearly states Speaker A's interest in teaching robotics, which ties into the ongoing discussion about teaching as a career pathway. This context enhances the relevance and usefulness of Speaker A's aspiration to teach robotics. MEMORY 1 has redundant information and less clarity on Speaker B's potential career path in academia, which might not be as helpful for Speaker A's response.\n\nChoice: 2"
