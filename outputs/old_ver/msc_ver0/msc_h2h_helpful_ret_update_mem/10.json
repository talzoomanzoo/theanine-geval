    "prediction": "Explanation: The context relates to Speaker A discussing the excitement of trying a new dish at their restaurant job and possibly getting a free dessert. Both memories provide information about Speaker A's job at a restaurant, with Memory 1 mentioning the two free meals per week which is pertinent to the potential of also getting a free dessert. However, Memory 2 also includes this information about the free meals, which directly answers the question from Speaker B about getting a free dessert. Thus, both memories are equally helpful in understanding the context and responding to it.\n\nChoice: tie"
