Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science, and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics. \nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities. \nSpeaker B majoring in linguistics causes Speaker A to be interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n3. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n4. Speaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\n5. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n6. Speaker A is involved with a football league and is looking forward to playing games.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nMEMORY 1 provides information about both speakers, underlining Speaker A's inclination toward teaching robotics, a detail that directly ties to the conversation about teaching. It also includes details about Speaker B's academic path and feelings of limited job opportunities, which could be relevant if Speaker B seeks advice from Speaker A who is studying computer science for developing apps. Although it repeats some elements, it adequately covers Speaker A's interest which relates to the conversation context.\n\nMEMORY 2, however, enriches the context with details about Speaker B's volunteering activities, which might not be directly relevant to the current thread of conversation about career options and teaching. It also mentions Speaker A's involvement in a football league, which is unrelated to the conversation about career goals and education. This MEMORY contains more specific but less relevant details compared to MEMORY 1.\n\nChoice: 1"
