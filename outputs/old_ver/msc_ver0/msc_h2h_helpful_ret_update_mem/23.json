Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\nSpeaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\nSpeaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\nSpeaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.\nSpeaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe?\nSpeaker B: There is some weird chemical mix that I really do not mess with.  It is easy to clean up.  I try to stay away from this part of the movies.  I know what it should look like and that we want to keep everyone safe when using the fake blood.\nSpeaker A: Chemicals!  Do the actors hate working with it then?  I can imagine they are a pretty high maintenance bunch.  Do they worry about the blood messing with their looks?\nSpeaker B: Our actors are pretty amateur.  No big name ones so they are really good to work with.  Hey, how about you?  How is your interview practice going?  I am pretty sure you be excellent during it! \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B enjoys painting and taking naps, while Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them.

This led to a change in Speaker A's preference, as they now prefer classic horror movies like Halloween or Friday the 13th over modern ones.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1.

    "prediction": "Explanation: In the current dialogue, Speaker B mentions working with amateur actors and then shifts the conversation to asking about Speaker A's interview practice. Speaker A's nervousness and excitement about their upcoming interview, as mentioned in Memory 2, provides relevant context that can be useful for Speaker A to continue the conversation about the interview. Memory 1, while it provides some background about Speaker B's and Speaker A's preferences and interests in horror movies, doesn't specifically address the interview context as explicitly as Memory 2. \n\nChoice: 2"
