I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field?\nSpeaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate?\nSpeaker B: I have another year- so this year is really important I get internships and start making connections in the field.   I love going to the beach too.  What happened with your knees that now cause you so much pain? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A mentioning their neighbor John, who loves soccer, leads Speaker B to study sports medicine, play soccer, and aim to join their college team. This interest causes Speaker B to seek internships in sports medicine and enjoy surfing instead. Speaker B's professors being supportive in writing letters for an internship application causes Speaker A to offer advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field. Speaker B, as a college student playing soccer with peers, transitions to looking for internships in sports medicine, asking professors for letters of recommendation. This change results in Speaker B struggling to find internships and feeling disadvantaged compared to those with connections.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Networking and Connections', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A suggests networking opportunities and connections for Speaker B's goals.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: I'll definitely let him know about you. Would you be okay with him reaching out to you directly? He's always excited to share his soccer knowledge. ### Speaker B: Oh man, that would be great, thank you! I really want to make the team so I need all the help I can get! ### Speaker A: Sounds good. Have your professors been pretty receptive to writing letter for you? ### Speaker B: For the internship? Yeah they've been great. I'm really lucky I've got cool profs this year. ### Speaker A: How's the internship hunt going? ### Speaker B: It's tough right now to be honest. Not enough internships for too many students. ### Speaker A: I am sorry to hear that. The job market should pick up soon. The good thing about being in the medical field is that there is always a need for more help! ### Speaker B: Sports medicine is so popular right now. All the young sports fans grown up I guess.  ### Speaker A: Well, keep confidence in yourself that you are the best of the best and will outshine the competition! ### Speaker B: I hope so. Everyone else has all these connections through family and stuff. Their dad knows someone, etc. Gotta beat that. ### Speaker A: Keep up the surfing and maybe you will make some connections that way. ### Speaker B: That's true. I've heard that a lot of doctors surf on breaks to get their minds clear. Good idea' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships! ###Speaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 is more helpful because it contains direct references to Speaker A providing networking opportunities and highlights the importance of connections, which is directly relevant to Speaker B's concern about finding internships and making connections in their field. It also reflects on the job market and offers encouragement to Speaker B. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, provides background on Speaker B's interest in sports medicine and struggling with finding internships, but lacks the specific connection to Speaker A's role in offering networking opportunities.\n\nChoice: 2"
