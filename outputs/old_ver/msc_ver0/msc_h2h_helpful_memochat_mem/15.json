    "prediction": "Explanation: When deciding between the two memories based on helpfulness, it is important to identify which one adds more context and useful information to the current dialogue scenario. The current dialogue revolves around Speaker B's potential visit to Speaker A and asking about logistics like car rentals and summer weather in Alaska.\n\nMemory 1 mentions multiple elements, including the invitation to visit, plans for concerts, and the excitement about the trip. This covers diverse aspects but does not offer specific insights into the logistics of getting around or about the summer weather.\n\nMemory 2, on the other hand, presents directly related topics: \"Visiting Alaska\" and \"Summer in Alaska,\" which are directly aligned with Speaker B’s question about transport options and year-round weather. The memory mentions the availability of greenery and activities during summer, which is closer to answering Speaker B’s current query.\n\nTherefore, based on relevance and helpfulness to address the last query of the Dialogue Context, Memory 2 is more useful.\n\nChoice: 2"
