Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n6. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 is more helpful as it directly mentions that Speaker A's cousin lives in Sweden and is helping to plan the trip, which aligns with the current dialogue context where Speaker A mentions their cousin is helping with the plan. Additionally, MEMORY 1 provides a suggestion from Speaker B about the volcanoes which is relevant to Speaker A's query about must-sees in Sweden. MEMORY 2, while containing several facts about Sweden trips and both speakers, doesn't provide specific insights or suggestions for Speaker A's current planning stage.\n\nChoice: 1"
