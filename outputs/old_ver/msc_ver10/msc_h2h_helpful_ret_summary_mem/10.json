Additionally, it includes information about Speaker A handling a fire incident, which is not directly helpful, but the remaining details are useful for this context about restaurant work benefits. Memory 2 also contains this relevant information, but it does not mention the fire incident, making it more concise and focused, which is better for addressing the dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 2"
