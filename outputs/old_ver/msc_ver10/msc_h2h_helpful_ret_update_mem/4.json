Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\nSpeaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient! \nSpeaker A: Wow, that gives me a completely different perspective. You'd really be ok with seeing me? You don't think it would be a conflict of interest since we're friends? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A enjoys being around horses, involved in horse breeding and taking care of them. Speaker B is concerned about the cost of owning horses, including medical fees and expenses like horse shoes, and also considers the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories. \nSpeaker B's mom being a nurse and busy with work caused Speaker B to become a therapist, mentioning the ups and downs of the profession, and be a professional in a practice where it is illegal for them to have relationships with clients. \nSpeaker B, a therapist and a football fan supporting the Chiefs, talks about the profession's challenges and the legal restrictions on relationships with clients.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n2. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n3. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n4. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n5. Speaker B is a professional in a practice, where it is illegal for them to have relationships with clients.\n6. Speaker B lives in the city and is interested in having a horse in the future.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The main concern raised in the dialogue context by Speaker A is about the potential conflict of interest since Speaker B is their friend and a potential therapist.
