Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon?\nSpeaker A: Yes!  As a matter of fact, I'm visiting my son that lives in Spain next month.  This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now!\nSpeaker B: Oh nice. You must be looking forward to it. He must have told you a lot about her. Do you think you would like her? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A has multiple sons, at least one of them is in a relationship with a Spanish girlfriend. Speaker A has two sons, one of whom has a girlfriend and the other is secretive and possibly gay. Speaker A has two sons who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next. Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe. Speaker B's younger son would be jealous of Speaker A's sons' European tour. Speaker B's sons would possibly get along well with Speaker A's sons.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A has two sons who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next.\n2. Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe.\n3. Speaker B's younger son would be jealous of Speaker A's sons' European tour.\n4. Speaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite worrying about them traveling far away.\n5. Speaker B has two sons, one of whom has had a girlfriend for several years and the other is secretive.\n6. Speaker B's sons would possibly get along well with Speaker A's sons.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The relevant memory for Speaker A would contain information specifically about Speaker A's relationship with their son's girlfriend or their thoughts on meeting her. Both memories fall short in this aspect. Memory 1 directly mentions that one of Speaker A's sons is in a relationship with a Spanish girlfriend, which is more directly tied to Speaker B's question about whether Speaker A thinks they will like her. Memory 2, on the other hand, provides some insights into Speaker A's feelings about their sons (such as enjoying spending time with them and worrying about them traveling) but lacks direct detail about the girlfriend or meeting her. Thus, Memory 1 is marginally more helpful for the specific question being addressed.\n\nChoice: 1"
