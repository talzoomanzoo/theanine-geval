I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument. This experience has led to Co-worker A presenting evidence in front of a judge to support their position in the past, where they denied that their reputation had any impact on Karen giving them the money.\n   \n2.

This provides a more comprehensive understanding of Co-worker A's background and approach to public speaking and presenting arguments.\n\nChoice: 2"
