That seems like ages ago.\nCo-workers B: Well, now you can finally take on that leadership role and make your dreams a reality.\nCo-workers A: That's true. It's amazing how life works out sometimes. But it hasn't always been smooth sailing. Remember when I was really stressed about you not liking me? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1.

It also connects Co-worker A's aspirations with their feelings and interactions, which is more directly related to the dialogue context.
