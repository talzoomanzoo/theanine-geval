    "prediction": "Explanation: The criterion in focus is \"Helpfulness,\" specifically whether the memory provides relevant, specific details about both speakers that can enable Speaker A to respond appropriately to the last utterance in the dialogue context. Memory 1 provides information such as Speaker A's sister recently got married and that the sister is a dog person with a yellow lab, which could relate to Speaker B's suggestion of Speaker A going to the zoo with their sister and the mention of bringing a dog. Memory 2, while also relevant, is less detailed when it comes to potential context for Speaker A's response, offering a broader overview of interests and behaviors without details like the recent marriage of Speaker A's sister, which could add depth to the interaction.\n\nChoice: 1"
