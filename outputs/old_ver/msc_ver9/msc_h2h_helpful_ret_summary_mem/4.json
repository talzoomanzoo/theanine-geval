    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain specific details that is useful and relevant about both speakers, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\nSpeaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient! \nSpeaker A: Wow, that gives me a completely different perspective. You'd really be ok with seeing me? You don't think it would be a conflict of interest since we're friends? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A enjoys being around horses, involved in horse breeding and taking care of them. Speaker B is concerned about the cost of owning horses, including medical fees and expenses like horse shoes, and also considers the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories. \nSpeaker B's mom being a nurse and busy with work caused Speaker B to become a therapist, mentioning the ups and downs of the profession, and be a professional in a practice where it is illegal for them to have relationships with clients. \nSpeaker B, a therapist and a football fan supporting the Chiefs, talks about the profession's challenges and the legal restrictions on relationships with clients.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist, mentioning the ups and downs of the profession.\n2. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n3. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n4. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n5. Speaker A works at a stable and enjoys being around horses.\n6. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 contains detailed information about both speakers that is directly relevant to the ongoing conversation, such as Speaker A's interest and involvement with horses, and Speaker B's experience with the legal restrictions of being a therapist. This is useful for responding to the question about therapy being a conflict of interest and how it might be impacted by their friendship. MEMORY 2, while containing some relevant details, lacks the specificity needed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the conversation's context, especially regarding the potential conflict of interest in therapy.\n\nChoice: 1"
