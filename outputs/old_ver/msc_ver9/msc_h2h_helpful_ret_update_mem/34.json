    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 both provide relevant information about Speaker A and Speaker B's zoo visits and interests in animals. However, MEMORY 1 includes additional specific details such as Speaker B's willingness to be a \"cool uncle\" and their preference regarding having children, Speaker A's sister's recent marriage, the specific type of pet Speaker A prefers (cockatoos over kittens), and that Speaker A's sister has a yellow lab, which are not directly relevant to the current dialogue context.
