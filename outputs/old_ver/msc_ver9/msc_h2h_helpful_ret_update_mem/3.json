Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n6. Speaker B's parents still live in Sweden, and they find it expensive to travel there.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides specific information about the interest of Speaker A in visiting Sweden due to their cousin living there and details about Speaker B's suggestion to check out the volcanoes in the country. This relates closely to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A is asking for must-see suggestions, making it directly relevant for Speaker B to respond with specific suggestions based on the established information. MEMORY 2, while it provides broader context about both speakers' connections to Sweden, lacks specific suggestions or details that directly respond to Speaker A's request for must-see sights.\n\nChoice: 1"
