    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?\nSpeaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping?\nSpeaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp?\nSpeaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer?\nSpeaker A: I've only camped in a tent so far, but would like to try out a camper trailer. What do use for camping?\nSpeaker B: We usually do tents but we have camped in yurts too. Did you go to the zoo last weekend?\nSpeaker A: I see. Yes, I did make it to the zoo.  Have you gone to your local zoo?\nSpeaker B: I went to the Bronx zoo it was amazing! Did you get to see Joshua? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A, who enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities, suggests taking the pets to the zoo and mentions that most major cities have good zoos. Speaker B, interested in finding family discounts for the zoo, wants to take their daughter's school on a field trip to the zoo.\nSpeaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys, which is the same topic where Speaker A mentions taking the pets to the zoo. Speaker B's daughter likes monkeys and is starting to assert her independence.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n2. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n3. Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys.\n4. Speaker A has a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo, particularly to see the tiger named Joshua.\n5. Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys.\n6. Speaker A suggests taking the pets to the zoo and mentions that most major cities have good zoos.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context revolves around discussions on visiting the zoo, and Speaker B inquires if Speaker A saw Joshua at the zoo. Memory 2 is helpful since it provides information about Speaker A's interest in seeing a tiger named Joshua at the zoo, which is directly relevant to Speaker B's question. Although Memory 1 also contains this information, it is less direct, with more superfluous details not immediately relevant to the question about Joshua.\n\nChoice: 2"
