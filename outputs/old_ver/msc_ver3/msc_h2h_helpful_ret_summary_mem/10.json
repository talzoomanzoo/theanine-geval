    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context revolves around Speaker A being excited about a dish added to the restaurant's menu and potentially getting dessert. Both memories provide similar relevant background information about Speaker A's work at the restaurant and meal perks. However, MEMORY 1 includes a unique, irrelevant detail about owning a restaurant and dealing with a fire incident, which does not pertain to the current context of trying new dishes for free. MEMORY 2 is more focused on relevant facts about Speaker A's job and free meal perks, which is more helpful for addressing Speaker B's question about free dessert possibilities.\n\nChoice: 2"
