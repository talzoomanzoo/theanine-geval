Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \nSpeaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!).\nSpeaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol\nSpeaker B: I am up for the challenge! I have a few tricks up my sleeve to deal with people like you.\nSpeaker A: Oh geez that makes me sound difficult.lol  Do you have any new speeches coming up?\nSpeaker B: Nope, I just cleared my schedule until the Alps marathon that you're training for. It's just you and me until you break that finish line. I'm going to start sending you a motivational quote every morning at 4 am when I want you to wake up. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B has run a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding. This experience led Speaker A to seek advice on how to recover from marathon training. Speaker A then invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and planning to meet at the beach at 0600. Speaker B got into motivational speaking because they needed it themselves to battle depression and anxiety, which was suggested by Speaker A to combine with something more active to avoid dwelling on negative thoughts. Speaker B, who travels frequently for work and misses their wife and kids, also finds solace in fishing and the outdoors, similar to their background in San Francisco.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Motivational Speaking', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker B shares about being a motivational speaker and how it helps them overcome personal struggles.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: I'm a motivational speaker!

Sometimes we need people to pull us up out of the abyss. How did you get into motivational speaking? ### Speaker B: I think it began because I needed motivational speaking myself.

    "prediction": "Explanation: To determine which memory is more helpful, we need to consider which one provides more relevant context for the ongoing conversation. Speaker A has asked whether Speaker B has any new speeches coming up, and Speaker B mentions preparing for the Alps marathon with Speaker A. Memory 1 offers context about previous marathon experiences and the personal reasons for Speaker B's involvement in motivational speaking, which aligns well with the conversational direction about marathon training. Memory 2 discusses Speaker B's general motivational speaking career and personal struggles, which while relevant, does not tie as directly to the specific context of training and running a marathon.\n\nChoice: 1"
