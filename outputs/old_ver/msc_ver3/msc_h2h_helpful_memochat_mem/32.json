Have you and the kids had any chance to go skiing lately? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners. This causes Speaker A to have a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes. Speaker A learned how to make jello from their grandma, turning it into a family tradition. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Family traditions and recipes', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A talks about learning jello recipes from their grandma and how it has become a family tradition.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: Right! It's so good! I'm not a very good cook but I do know how to make jello! ### Speaker B: Well that's a good start I guess! Did you grandma teach you how to make it? ### Speaker A: Yeah she did teach me! It's become a family tradition! ### Speaker B: That's so sweet! I wish I had the opportunity to spend that kind of quality time with my grandparents. ### Speaker A: It is very nice! Why don't you have the time? ### Speaker B: They were always pretty busy running their grocery store and I never really got much of a chance to spend that kind of time with them before they died, unfortunately. ### Speaker A: My grandma just taught me an even better cherry jello recipe than the one she taught me before.  ### Speaker B: Nice! How did it turn out? ### Speaker A: Not too bad but still needs some work! ### Speaker B: I am sure the more you make it the better it will get. Has your grandma taught you to make anything else? ### Speaker A: She's taught me how to make all kinds of recipes but all of them are with jello.  So I may need to find a different teacher to learn some new recipes! Do you like to bake? ### Speaker B: No I don't do a lot of cooking or baking, I do want to learn though but I don't have anyone to teach me. ### Speaker A: Well my grandma would be happy to get you started on the jello recipes, haha! You can consider her your surrogate grandma, she would just love that.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 focuses specifically on jello recipes and Speaker A's family tradition with their grandma, which directly relates to the conversation about jello and family traditions. It suggests Speaker A could offer some support or relate personally to Speaker B's mention of teaching jello recipes to kids. MEMORY 2 contains broader information about family traditions and some dialogue elements not directly tied to the current conversation, making it less concise and slightly less directly relevant to respond contextually to Speaker B's mention of skiing.\n\nChoice: 1"
