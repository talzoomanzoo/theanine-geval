Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon?\nSpeaker A: Yes!  As a matter of fact, I'm visiting my son that lives in Spain next month.  This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now!\nSpeaker B: Oh nice. You must be looking forward to it. He must have told you a lot about her. Do you think you would like her? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A has multiple sons, at least one of them is in a relationship with a Spanish girlfriend. Speaker A has two sons, one of whom has a girlfriend and the other is secretive and possibly gay. Speaker A has two sons who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next. Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe. Speaker B's younger son would be jealous of Speaker A's sons' European tour. Speaker B's sons would possibly get along well with Speaker A's sons.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A has two sons who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next.\n2.

Speaker B has two sons, one of whom has had a girlfriend for several years and the other is secretive.\n6. Speaker B's sons would possibly get along well with Speaker A's sons.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: In evaluating both memories for their helpfulness, we want to find information that can assist Speaker A in formulating a relevant and appropriate response to the query about meeting the son's girlfriend. MEMORY 1 contains the pertinent detail that Speaker A is looking forward to meeting the girlfriend, while MEMORY 2 emphasizes Speaker A's concerns about their sons traveling and implies less about the relationship with the girlfriend. The direct mention of the girlfriend in MEMORY 1 makes it slightly more helpful in the context of the conversation topic.\n\nChoice: 1"
