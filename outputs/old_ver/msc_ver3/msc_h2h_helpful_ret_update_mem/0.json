Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico.

Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about?

Memory 1 contains relevant information about Speaker B's oldest nephew turning 14, which directly connects to the context. Additionally, although Memory 2 also provides this information, Memory 1 provides this information in a more succinct manner that is directly useful for the response.\n\nChoice: 1"
