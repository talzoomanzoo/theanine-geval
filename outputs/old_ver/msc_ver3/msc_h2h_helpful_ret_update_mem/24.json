    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go?\nSpeaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \nSpeaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on?\nSpeaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B is excelling in the sports medicine class, causing Speaker A to struggle with maintaining good grades and only excel in gym.\nSpeaker B and Speaker A both find history class boring and overwhelming, with Speaker B eager to finish school to escape their mother's strictness.\nSpeaker B is pressured to maintain straight A's in sports medicine to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n2. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n3. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n4. Speaker B feels overwhelmed by their mother's strictness and is eager to finish school to escape it.\n5. Both speakers value good grades and believe it can lead to better job opportunities.\n6. Speaker A advises Speaker B to take breaks and prioritize their own happiness and well-being.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context revolves around discussing exams and studying, with Speaker A requesting Speaker B's help in studying for an English final. MEMORY 1 provides a bit more specific information about Speaker B in terms of academic pressures and parental influence, which could help contextualize their response. Specifically, Speaker B's experience and pressure to maintain good grades might relate to their ability to help Speaker A with studying. However, MEMORY 2 also includes this information and goes further, outlining Speaker A's specific academic struggles, which could contribute meaningfully to Speaker B's response in understanding why Speaker A might need help. Both memories offer somewhat relevant insights, but MEMORY 2 provides a broader and more detailed context that could help Speaker B craft a supportive and empathetic response to help Speaker A with their studies, including general advice from Speaker A to Speaker B.\n\nChoice: 2"
