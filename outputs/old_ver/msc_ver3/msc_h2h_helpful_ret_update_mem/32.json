I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts.\nSpeaker A: How's learning to bake going in general, especially now that you're off desserts?\nSpeaker B: I one of those people how have to fail a couple of times before I get the hang of it, but I'm getting there.  Have you and the kids had any chance to go skiing lately? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners.

    "prediction": "Explanation: When assessing the helpfulness of the two memories regarding the dialogue context, we need to consider which memory offers information that helps Speaker A respond meaningfully to Speaker B's statement about skiing and learning to bake. MEMORY 1 highlights Speaker A's strong connection to jello and their grandmother's teaching of recipes, which ties back to Speaker B's initial mention of jello. However, it lacks direct relevance to skiing. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, includes a detail about Speaker B's excitement to engage in a water skiing trip with Speaker A's family, making it directly relevant and helpful for continuing the conversation about skiing.\n\nChoice: 2"
