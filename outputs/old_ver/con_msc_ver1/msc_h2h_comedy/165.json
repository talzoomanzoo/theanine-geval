And remember, when you retire down south on a beach, I'll come visit you in my smart car!\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: Yes, I found some good flights that work for my schedule. I'm excited to visit you soon!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses start by confirming that Speaker B has found flights to visit Speaker A. However, Response 2 is more consistent with the past memories as it appropriately reflects that Speaker B will be visiting Speaker A soon and aligns with their past discussions about flight schedules and finding cheap flights. Response 1 contains inconsistent information about Speaker B visiting Speaker A in their smart car when they retire down south since it's Speaker A who plans to retire there, not Speaker B. Additionally, the mention of visiting Alaska contradicts the current plan of visiting Speaker A, who enjoys warm weather, indicating they are not currently in Alaska.\n\nChoice: 2"
