    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 is inconsistent because it mentions that Speaker B bought Resident Evil VIII and plans to play it with Speaker A next week, but in the past memories, it is already established that Speaker B bought Resident Evil VIII and is planning to play it alone in the dark. It also contradicts the past plan that Speaker A and Speaker B would be trying Resident Evil and Jurassic Park games together. Additionally, it implies that Speaker A is joining in for a multiplayer experience, which is inconsistent with the past memory stating that Jurassic Park is single-player and lacks the multiplayer option. \n\nResponse 2 remains consistent with the past memories as it mentions League of Legends, which Speaker B plays often, and it asks if Speaker A has tried Resident Evil, aligning with their plan to play games together, within the context given.\n\nChoice: 2"
