    "prediction": "Explanation: The past memories do not mention Speaker B having grandchildren; instead, Speaker B has a son. They also express a preference in past memories for books, particularly about animals, which can be inferred to be more light-hearted rather than intense crime dramas. Response 1 contradicts the past memories in that it mistakenly states Speaker B enjoys intense crime dramas and speaks about babysitting grandchildren, which is not consistent with the past information that they only have a son. Response 2 aligns with Speaker B's preference for reading by not indicating a liking for intense crime dramas.\n\nChoice: 2"
