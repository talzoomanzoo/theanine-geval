    "prediction": "Explanation: The information provided in Response 1 concerning Speaker B is inconsistent with the past memories. In the memories, Speaker B is mentioned to work in a doctor's office and does not have time to surf anymore, whereas Response 1 suggests that they play in a band, love writing music, and are called \"lil fishie\", which contradicts the memories related to Speaker A. On the other hand, Response 2 accurately avoids including any contradictions about Speaker B's known characteristics as per the past memories and appropriately questions Speaker A about their instrument.\n\nChoice: 2"
