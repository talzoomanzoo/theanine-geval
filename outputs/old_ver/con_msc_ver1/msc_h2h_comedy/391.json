I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. \nSpeaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A:  That's an interesting idea, but I think I'll stick to trying to keep the raccoons out of my garbage for now. Bandicoot sounds like quite the troublemaker, but it's great that you're able to bring him to work with you. How do you manage to keep him entertained while you're working at the Raccoon Cafe?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm a bit hesitant to befriend them. I'll see how the sheeting works first. By the way, how is Bandicoot adjusting to being at the zoo with you?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 is consistent with the past memories and current conversation. It aligns with Speaker B taking Bandicoot to work at the Raccoon Cafe, as mentioned in the past memories. Response 2, however, introduces an inconsistency by suggesting that Bandicoot is adjusting to being at the zoo with Speaker B, which contradicts the information that Speaker B works at the Raccoon Cafe and brings Bandicoot there.\n\nChoice: 1"
