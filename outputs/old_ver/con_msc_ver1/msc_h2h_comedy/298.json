Let's try that again.\n\nExplanation: \nResponse 1 contains inconsistent information; Speaker A mentions having a \"usual bartending routine,\" which contradicts the past memories where Speaker B works as a bartender. Response 2 focuses only on the Brazilian steak, which aligns with past memories of Speaker A and their brother enjoying Brazilian food and the steak specifically. Therefore, Response 2 is consistent with the past memories.\n\nChoice: 2"
