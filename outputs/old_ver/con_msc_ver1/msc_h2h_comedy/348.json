    "prediction": "Explanation: \nIn Response 1, Speaker B mentions teaching a healthier version of their grandma's jello recipe, which contradicts past memories because Speaker B does not have experiences of making their grandparent's recipes or the opportunity to learn them, as their grandparents were busy and have passed away. Furthermore, the mention of teaching Speaker A is inconsistent since Speaker A has a well-established family tradition of jello-making learned from their grandmother. In Response 2, Speaker B sticks to the idea of laying off desserts without introducing contradictory elements related to family recipes or jello-making experiences.\n\nChoice: 2"
