    "prediction": "Explanation: Based on the past memories, there is no mention of Speaker B having seen the Black Widow movie, which aligns with Response 2 where Speaker B acknowledges having seen some Marvel movies but not Black Widow specifically. Response 1 is inconsistent because it incorrectly provides information about the Black Widow movie as if Speaker B is familiar with it, which contradicts Speaker B's statement of not having seen it in Response 2.\n\nChoice: 2"
