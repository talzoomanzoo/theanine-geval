Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too?\nSpeaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also?\nSpeaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways?\nSpeaker B: They've been better as I left my previous job so I'm spending more time with them, how do you manage to work full time and still keep those animals happy?\nSpeaker A: I think working at the zoo so long has helped. Why did you leave your last job. Was that the one you were working in the warehouse? Sorry to hear about your dogs, it can be hard managing older animals.\nSpeaker B: Yea, that totally makes sense! I just wanted time off to spend with the dogs and look for a better job elsewhere, I'm hoping that I'll be able to get a job outside of a warehouse!\nSpeaker A: That is understandable. I didn't always think I would end up a zookeeper. Do you have anything in mind?\nSpeaker B: Well, I really enjoy animals so I might think of applying to work in a zoo aswell! Is it a super busy job?\nSpeaker A: That sounds like a great idea! You would be surprised how busy it can be. Not every job is high demanding and you don't have to work with all the animals either. Is there anything you don't like to do? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B:  It sounds like you have such a fulfilling job at the zoo! I can't wait to join you there and start working with the animals. I'm excited to see what kind of music they enjoy and maybe even have a pet concert with your white tigers one day! And you know, I think our dogs would love a playdate with Journey and Sid too. Let's plan something fun for them soon!\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: I don't mind getting my hands dirty, so I'm open to any tasks at the zoo! What's the most challenging part of working there, in your opinion?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The past memories indicate that Speaker A mentioned that Speaker B was looking forward to playing music for the animals, but starting with something safer than the white tigers. Therefore, Response 1 is inconsistent because it mentions having a pet concert with the white tigers, which contradicts the past memory of avoiding them for music sessions. Response 2 does not contain any information that contradicts the past memories.\n\nChoice: 2"
