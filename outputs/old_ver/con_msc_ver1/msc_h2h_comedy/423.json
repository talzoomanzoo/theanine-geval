I actually just finished reading an interesting study about snake behavior and how it relates to neuroscience. It's fascinating to see how different species have evolved unique ways of survival.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: I bet Hansel and Gretel are keeping you entertained!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 2 is consistent with the past memories because it acknowledges that Speaker B has pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel, which is consistent with the information provided. Response 1, on the other hand, is inconsistent because Speaker A does not have any pets according to the past memories, so they cannot have pet snakes that are \"doing great.\"\n\nChoice: 2"
