    "prediction": "Explanation: Both response options reference Speaker B's daughter's connection with zoos and animals, aligning with past memories. However, Response 1 specifically mentions “the monkeys” and the daughter's growing independence, which is consistent with the details provided in the past memories where the daughter is noted to love monkeys and is asserting her independence. Therefore, Response 1 provides more detailed consistency with the past memories than Response 2.\nChoice: 1"
