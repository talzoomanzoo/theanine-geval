I haven't started teaching her about Greek mythology yet, but I think she would love the stories. I'll have to start incorporating some of those tales into our bedtime stories.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: She's doing great, thanks for asking. I've mentioned some stories to her, but she's more into fairy tales at the moment.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are consistent with past memories regarding Speaker B having a daughter. However, response 1 is more consistent as it directly mentions not having started teaching the daughter about Greek mythology yet, which aligns with the past memories that Speaker B has an interest in Greek mythology but doesn't mention sharing it with the daughter. Response 2 starts by mentioning they have already told some stories, which does not totally contradict any past information but is slightly less aligned with the action of starting to incorporate these stories, as described in Response 1.\n\nChoice: 1"
