We're going with Pumpkin!\nSpeaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name? \nSpeaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls! \nSpeaker B: I see what you meant. Plus the color is beautiful orange. I want to see them together, even I am not a cat person they must be cute together at that time. Once the kitten grows up, situation gonna change to me. How are they, they are doing well?\nSpeaker A: Marmalade is orange too but this is better because the baby is sassy and climbs up my leg to sit on my shoulder. I don't understand how you are not a cat person when you have such a large heart for stray kittens.\nSpeaker B: hehe you're right. But i can't explain that why I am not a cat person to you sorry. How's the weather like today, still good weather to have iced tea out there?\nSpeaker A: It's beautiful. I'm sitting outside while the Spice Girls are chasing bugs in the grass. What did your kids name your cats?\nSpeaker B: ohh so nice sounds like you are enjoying the weather. Still we are discussing about that. Did not name them yet.

I am trying to be nice to them do not worry \nSpeaker A: They all have their own unique personalities and maybe you will enjoy them more once you get to know them better.
