I'm sure your kids will cherish those memories just like you do.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: That's such a wonderful tradition to pass on to your kids! Family recipes are so special.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nBased on the past memories, it is Speaker A who learned jello recipes from their grandmother and has been suggested by Speaker A that Speaker B could learn jello recipes from their grandmother as a surrogate grandma. Speaker B does not have their own grandmother's jello recipe to pass on, as their grandparents were busy and they regret not spending time with them. Therefore, Response 1 is inconsistent because it addresses Speaker B as having their own grandmotherâ€™s jello recipe and suggests they are passing it on to their kids, which contradicts the past memories. Response 2 does not assume ownership of the jello recipe by Speaker B and is consistent with the possibility that Speaker B is passing on a learned recipe, possibly involving Speaker A's grandmother.\n\nChoice: 2"
