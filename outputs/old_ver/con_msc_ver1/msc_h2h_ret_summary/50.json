I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: Therapy can definitely have an end goal, and it's great to see clients reach that point of completion.

If you ever decide to give it a try, I'd be happy to help guide you through that journey.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: Therapy can definitely have a beginning, middle, and end, and it's great to hear about your positive experiences with your horses. Let me know if you ever decide to give therapy a try, I'd be more than happy to help.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 is consistent with the past memories, as it aligns with Speaker B's profession and their comments about the rewarding aspects of helping clients through their journey. It does not include any information that contradicts past memories or Speaker B's professional ethics. Response 2, while consistent in terms of Speaker B offering help as a therapist, does not directly address Speaker A's specific statement about therapy's completion. It instead shifts the focus back to Speaker A's experience with horses, which may not be as relevant to the current discussion about therapy. Both responses maintain consistency with Speaker B's profession and offer their services appropriately, respecting professional boundaries. However, Response 1 is more focused on the completion aspect of therapy, which was directly mentioned by Speaker A.\n\nChoice: 1"
