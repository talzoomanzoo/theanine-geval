    "model_input": "Your task is to choose the better response based on the below criterion.\nYou will be given a list of past memories, a current conversation between two individuals, and two options of next responses.\n\nCRITERION:\nConsistency - The response should not contain information that contradicts the past memory.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the response that has better Consistency given the past memories and current conversation.\n\nPAST MEMORIES:\nSpeaker A is a high school student planning to go to college, achieving straight A's.\nSpeaker B is also a high school student preparing for college, working at a diner at night.\nSpeaker A enjoys running and listening to music as hobbies.\nSpeaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\nSpeaker A's parents are blue-collar workers, not supporting their education.\nSpeaker B lives alone with a deaf dog and finds inspiration in neuroscience.\nSpeaker A's dad is a steel worker, emphasizing the value of hard work in life.\nSpeaker B has a deaf dog named Sparky, a beagle breed.\nSpeaker A is interested in getting a dog and had a hamster named Leonardo in the past.\nSpeaker A suggests getting a border collie breed for running and exercise.\nSpeaker B had another dog named Paco when they were younger.\nSpeaker A offers to take Sparky for a walk to help out and spend time with the dog.\nSpeaker B is busy and appreciates the offer to help with Sparky.\nSpeaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner.\nSpeaker A is considering getting a dog and already walks Speaker B's dog, Sparky.\nSpeaker B's dog is deaf and needs to be kept on a lead due to recall difficulties.\nSpeaker A and Speaker B discuss the challenges and rewards of having a dog with hearing issues.\nSpeaker B's dog is very loving and attentive, possibly because of the deafness.\nSpeaker A and Speaker B agree on the unconditional love and attention dogs provide.\nSpeaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\nSpeaker A had cheesy ham and potato soup for dinner.\nSpeaker A is a freshman in school, trying to finish in 3 years.\nSpeaker B is close to finishing school with just two more weeks left.\nSpeaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\nSpeaker B is considering giving up their night job to focus on lab work and school.\nSpeaker A recommends taking summer classes to get ahead and make friends with classmates.\nSpeaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\nSpeaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n\nCURRENT CONVERSATION:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: Absolutely, I would definitely try a hamburger from a cloned cow! It's fascinating to think about the advancements in science and how it can potentially revolutionize the food industry. Your work in the lab must be so intriguing, especially with your interest in molecular biology.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: Definitely, I'd be curious to try it! It would be interesting to see if there's any difference in taste.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "I'm sorry, it seems there was an error in providing the explanation for the output. Let me correct that.\n\nExplanation: Response 1 is consistent with past memories as it aligns with Speaker B's interest and work in the lab with molecular biology. It does not introduce any contradictions. Response 2 is also consistent as it stays within the context of trying cloned cow hamburgers and doesn't contradict past information. Both responses maintain consistency with Speaker Bâ€™s interests and do not contradict past memories.\n\nChoice: tie"
