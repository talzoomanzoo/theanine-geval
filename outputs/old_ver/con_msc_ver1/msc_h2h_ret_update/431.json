    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are consistent with the past memories as Speaker B is a member of the Boy Scouts and would have learned survival skills such as setting up shelters and starting fires. Neither response contradicts any of the past memories provided. However, Response 1 provides more detail and aligns closely with the memory that Speaker B has been involved in Boy Scouts for several years, suggesting they would have had opportunities to practice these skills in depth. Both responses work, but Response 1 is slightly more informative.\n\nChoice: 1"
