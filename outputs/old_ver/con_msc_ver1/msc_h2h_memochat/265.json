It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: I'm glad to hear that your history exam went pretty well with a B grade! I still have more exams coming up, so unfortunately, I'm not on a break yet.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: I still have one more history exam coming up before the break. Hopefully, I can improve my grade on that one. How about you, any big plans for the break?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 contradicts the information from the current conversation. Speaker A should not be congratulating themselves on their history exam when Speaker B already acknowledged the B grade. Additionally, the mention of \"your\" history exam incorrectly attributes ownership of the exam to Speaker B instead of Speaker A. Response 2, however, introduces a new, potentially inconsistent detail that there is another history exam coming up, but it is less of a contradiction compared to the miscommunication in response 1.\n\nChoice: 2"
