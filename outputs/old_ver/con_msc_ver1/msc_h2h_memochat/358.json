Response 1 mentions looking forward to their gaming session next week, which is consistent with their plans to meet. Response 2 does not contradict any past memory either, as Speaker A asks about Speaker B's experience, which could naturally follow from Speaker B enjoying playing Resident Evil during the storm.\n\nChoice: tie"
