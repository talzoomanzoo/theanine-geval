    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 is consistent with the past memories. Speaker B is a motivational speaker themselves and has experience in helping others overcome personal struggles, which aligns with them recommending someone for that purpose.

Both responses could technically fit, but Response 1 demonstrates an alignment with Speaker B's background and skills.\n\nChoice: 1"
