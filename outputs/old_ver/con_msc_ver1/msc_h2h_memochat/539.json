Visiting Spain often must have been amazing. What's stopping you from being excited about your career now?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses reference Speaker B's past experiences in France and Spain, which are consistent with the current conversation. However, Response 1 offers suggestions on how to incorporate excitement into Speaker B's work life, which aligns with memories of Speaker B being unsure about their career and looking to try different careers. Response 2, on the other hand, asks a question about Speaker B's current lack of excitement, which doesn't directly relate to the past memories provided. Both responses are consistent, but Response 1 offers more alignment with Speaker B's characteristics and past memories of seeking career change.\n\nChoice: tie"
