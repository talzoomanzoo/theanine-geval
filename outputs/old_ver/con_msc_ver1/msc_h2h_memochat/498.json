It has great features and functions that make it worth the cost.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: Yes, I'm really enjoying all the new features and the improved camera quality.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are generally consistent with past memories as they do not contradict any specific memory. However, response 1 acknowledges the aspect of the iPhone being expensive but justifying it with its great features, which could tie to Speaker A's previous sentiment of valuing practical and peaceful life and not focusing on luxurious items, as they have a more practical and satisfaction-based comment regarding the worth of the cost. Response 2 might seem more standard and somewhat focuses just on the features without addressing the price aspect, which doesn't necessarily draw from the past memories. But both responses are consistent in their own way since memories didn't explicitly mention a stance on technology or specific products outside their lifestyles.\n\nChoice: tie"
