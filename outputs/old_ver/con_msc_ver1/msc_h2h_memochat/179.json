We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like.\nSpeaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too.\nSpeaker B: Nice!

    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 is inconsistent because it suggests that staying at the cabin is an opportunity for Speaker A, despite the fact that the offer was specifically directed to Speaker B and their pregnant wife. Additionally, it repeats information Speaker B already acknowledged. Response 2 does not introduce any information that contradicts the past memories and aligns with Speaker A's behavior of often attending events alone and enjoying music.\n\nChoice: 2"
