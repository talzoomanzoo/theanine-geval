I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. \nSpeaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me.\nSpeaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house. \nSpeaker B: Understandable. Have you ever tried contacting animal control? That's how I got Bandicoot. I was working that day and animal control came by explaining about needing fosters for raccoons. I thought it was weird, so I did it and began to work at the small raccoon cafe that is part of the zoo. I love it. \nSpeaker A: That is a good idea.  Maybe they could help move them to a safer area.  I have a lot of traffic around and they could get hit if they are coming to my place all the time.  Have you been able to teach your raccoon any tricks?\nSpeaker B: The only trick I was able to teach him, that I deeply regret, was how locks worked. I thought it was cool at first, you know, to see a raccoon unlock a door. And now, I regret it so much. I've had to change the layout of my apartment and put deadbolts on my doors so that Bandicoot can't get out. And, he is sneaky about it. One time, he unlocked the pantry and was eating some cookies! It's like having a toddler that never grows up. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: Have you considered using child safety locks or other creative solutions to prevent Bandicoot from accessing areas he shouldn't? It might help avoid any more cookie incidents!\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: Wow, Bandicoot sounds like quite the troublemaker! I hope he doesn't unlock anything that he shouldn't.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: None of the responses introduce new information that contradicts previous memories. However, Response 1 is more consistent with Speaker B's situation. Speaker A suggests using child safety locks or creative solutions which is consistent with trying new methods to prevent Bandicoot's mischievous actions, given that Speaker B has already had to adapt their living space. Response 2 is more of a casual comment and doesn’t engage with the provided context as deeply.\n\nChoice: 1"
