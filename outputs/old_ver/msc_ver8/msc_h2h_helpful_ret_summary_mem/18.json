    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker B to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college?\nSpeaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position. \nSpeaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it?\nSpeaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \nSpeaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living.\nSpeaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime?\nSpeaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with.\nSpeaker A: Sounds great! Now the tough question: when do you have time? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket but now plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week. They are a member of a soccer team and enjoy playing in tournaments. \nSpeaker A is a college student majoring in Humanities, not currently employed but used to work part-time at a supermarket. Lately, Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n2. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.\n3. Speaker A enjoys playing soccer but is not into music.\n4. Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n5. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n6. Speaker A is a fan of Arsenal and enjoys watching international teams play.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves a conversation centered around soccer, specifically discussing Speaker B's past experience and considering playing soccer again with Speaker A. It mentions coordinating and scheduling time for a casual soccer meet-up with friends. Therefore, relevant information would include any soccer-related details, Speaker A's interest in playing with others, as well as availability or schedule details.\n\nMEMORY 1 includes information that Speaker A is currently involved in soccer as part of a team, is a striker, has scored well recently, and is a college student, all of which relate to the ongoing discussion about soccer skills and potential scheduling.\n\nMEMORY 2 provides additional soccer-related context about both speakers' interests and teams, but does not give specific information about Speaker A's current schedule or availability which would be directly useful for scheduling the proposed game.\n\nWhile MEMORY 2 has more general details on both speakers' interests in soccer, MEMORY 1 contains the more relevant context needed for the immediate concern of scheduling a time to play with Speaker Aâ€™s proactive participation in soccer and student obligations being noted.\n\nChoice: 1"
