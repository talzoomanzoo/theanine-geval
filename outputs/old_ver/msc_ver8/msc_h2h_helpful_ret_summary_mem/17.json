    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context suggests Speaker A is keen on cooking and learning from Speaker B, who loves cooking and reminisces about a garlic chicken recipe linked to their grandmother. MEMORY 1 provides a focused context about Speaker B’s connection to the recipe through family gatherings, and it highlights Speaker A’s interest in cooking as a change from their beach-town lifestyle. MEMORY 2, although detailed, mixes seemingly unrelated memories like playing the drums or offering to give surfing lessons, which are less pertinent to the immediate cooking context of their conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
