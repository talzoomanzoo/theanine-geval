    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\nSpeaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call!\nSpeaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip?  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A is a librarian and loves kids, mentioning having 3 children. This makes Speaker A busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. Consequently, Speaker B, who has a lot of kids all grown up with kids of their own, enjoys spending time with their grandkids at the park. This led Speaker B to take their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n2. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n3. Speaker B has grandkids who are more interested in phones and tablets than musical instruments.\n4. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n5. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n6.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides additional context about Speaker A's work as a librarian and their busy schedule, explaining their familiarity and need to adapt to technology. This complements the dialogue where Speaker A mentions needing to learn to stay in touch due to work hours. MEMORY 1 also highlights Speaker B's experience with grandchildren, making the transition to discussing the fishing trip seem more natural. These details make MEMORY 1 more useful and relevant to formulating a response in the current conversation. MEMORY 2 has similar facts about the fishing trip and spending time with grandkids, but lacks context about Speaker A's reasons for using technology, consequently offering less depth for understanding the dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 1"
