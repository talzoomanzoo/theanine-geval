It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \nSpeaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on?\nSpeaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B is excelling in the sports medicine class, causing Speaker A to struggle with maintaining good grades and only excel in gym.\nSpeaker B and Speaker A both find history class boring and overwhelming, with Speaker B eager to finish school to escape their mother's strictness.\nSpeaker B is pressured to maintain straight A's in sports medicine to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring.\n2. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n3. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n4. Speaker B has been getting all A's in the sports medicine class.\n5. Speaker A wishes to get better grades and is hopeful for a soccer scholarship.\n6. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: In the dialogue, Speaker A asks if Speaker B can help them study for their last final in English. The most helpful memory would be the one that gives background on Speaker B's ability or willingness to help with studying. Memory 1 mentions that Speaker B is doing well in sports medicine and both Speaker A and B find history to be boring, which is partially relevant. Memory 2 provides more detailed information about the subjects Speaker B excels in and mentions Speaker A's aspirations and subjects of interest, however, it still does not mention English specifically or Speaker B's ability to help with English, which is what Speaker A asked for. Overall, Memory 2 is more detailed and provides some context about Speaker B's academic capabilities, so it might help in negotiating help with studying.\n\nChoice: 2"
