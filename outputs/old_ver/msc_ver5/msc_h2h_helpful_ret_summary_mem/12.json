I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science, and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics. \nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context revolves around Speaker A and Speaker B discussing their career plans related to teaching. Speaker A has expressed interest in teaching robotics someday. The relevant memories will contain information about their current studies and work experiences as it relates to these plans. MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 both contain useful information about Speaker A's interest in teaching computer science and Speaker B's considerations of becoming a professor after getting a master's degree, which directly pertains to the conversation.\n\nMEMORY 1, however, includes extra repetitive information that is not directly helpful in responding to Speaker B's compliment about parents being proud. Meanwhile, MEMORY 2 contains more concise and organized details relevant to the mentioned teaching ambitions and volunteering experiences which could provide useful context in relation to being praised for intelligence and teaching interest.\n\nChoice: 2"
