It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip?  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A is a librarian and loves kids, mentioning having 3 children. This makes Speaker A busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. Consequently, Speaker B, who has a lot of kids all grown up with kids of their own, enjoys spending time with their grandkids at the park. This led Speaker B to take their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1.

    "prediction": "Explanation: Both MEMORIES provide information about the family dynamics of Speaker A and Speaker B, as well as Speaker B's interest in making a fishing trip an annual tradition. However, MEMORY 1 is more structured and narrative-focused, which makes it more coherent and directly relevant to responding to Speaker B's question about the annual fishing trip. It includes details about how Speaker B enjoys spending time with their grandkids and has considered making the fishing trip an annual tradition, which directly relates to the last utterance of the dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 1"
