My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to?\nSpeaker A: I recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca.

Speaker B recommends Speaker A to watch 'Miracle'.\n6. Speaker B enjoys watching movies with her kids.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: We're focusing on whether Speaker B has relevant information about Speaker A's recent activities and how to naturally transition to discussing what Speaker B has been up to. In this context, having a memory that Speaker B's family enjoys Disney movies (as established in MEMORY 2) provides Speaker B with a smoother transition to relate back to Speaker A's recent Disney experience before shifting the conversation to her own recent activities.\n\nChoice: 2"
