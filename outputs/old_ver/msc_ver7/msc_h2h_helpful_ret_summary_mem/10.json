    "prediction": "Explanation: Speaker B's question about whether Speaker A will get a free dessert is related to the perks Speaker A receives from working at the restaurant. Memory 2 provides information about Speaker A receiving two free meals per week, which is directly relevant to free food at the restaurant and can help inform Speaker A's response. Memory 1 contains similar information but also includes irrelevant details about a fire incident at a restaurant owned by Speaker A, which could cause confusion as it is not related to the context. Therefore, Memory 2 is more helpful as it focuses on the specifics relevant to the discussion.\n\nChoice: 2"
