Hopefully your trip to the art museum is much better than that. Did your boyfriend go to Disney World too?\nSpeaker A: No, I had a cousin that I went with.

Was your concert crowded?\nSpeaker B: It was so crowded, but my older brothers went with me and kept me from getting squished. Make sure you wear sunscreen when you visit the beach this time!\nSpeaker A: Yes, I know to put on SPF 75 this time!
