It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip?  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nUser Description: Speaker B is a librarian who had a good day playing with his son's kids. He cherishes moments spent with his children and grandchildren. Speaker B's mother had the same profession as Speaker A. Speaker B has 3 grown-up children who mostly take the subway to work.\n\nRelationship Description: Speaker B and Speaker A share a mutual understanding and agreement on the challenges and rewards of being a librarian. They discuss the importance of libraries and the decline in children's interest in reading. Speaker A is proud to teach his youngest child the flute, which Speaker B finds interesting.\n\nEvent Description: Speaker B had a great time with his son and grandkids at the park. Speaker A thought about taking his grandkids to a library, and they discussed the relevance of paper books in the digital age. Speaker A's youngest child asked to learn the flute, inspired by Lizzo. Speaker B enjoys the creative ways libraries are staying relevant and mentioned a trip to the park with his grandkids.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nSpeaker A is a librarian and loves kids, mentioning having 3 children. This makes Speaker A busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. Consequently, Speaker B, who has a lot of kids all grown up with kids of their own, enjoys spending time with their grandkids at the park. This led Speaker B to take their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 directly addresses the notion of fishing trips with grandkids, which is relevant to Speaker B's question about the annual fishing trip idea. It provides context about Speaker B's experience taking the grandkids fishing and the intention to make it a tradition. MEMORY 1 provides some context about spending time with family and interests but does not specifically address the topic of fishing trips.\n\nChoice: 2"
