    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for.\nSpeaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for?\nSpeaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\nSpeaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise? \nSpeaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows.\nSpeaker A: That sounds wonderful! You'd get to just be out in nature all day. Sounds like a great job, especially if you're a bit introverted like me. That's why hiking is my favorite -- a good solitary activity. \nSpeaker B: Yes, I agree. What kind of hours would this new job have?\nSpeaker A: It's third shift, which isn't the greatest, but it pays a bit more than the other shifts, and I think I'll like getting off early in the morning. Then I can just go down and get in my hammock and have a nice relaxing moment after work. \nSpeaker B: Would you feel safe being out there all alone, possibly falling asleep? That just sounds a bit risky. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nUser Description: Speaker B is kind, caring, and hopeful for group equality.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is about Speaker A discussing their new third shift job and their plans to relax in a hammock after work.
