I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts.\nSpeaker A: How's learning to bake going in general, especially now that you're off desserts?\nSpeaker B: I one of those people how have to fail a couple of times before I get the hang of it, but I'm getting there.

Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context ends with Speaker B asking Speaker A whether they and their kids have had the chance to go skiing lately. Therefore, the memory should ideally contain information that might relate to skiing or outdoor activities, or at the very least maintain the friendliness and personal engagement seen in the conversation. \n\nMemory 1 discusses Speaker B's passion for snowboarding, which is relevant to the skiing question and shows an overlap in winter sports interests, providing a pathway for Speaker A to engage with the topic of skiing. Additionally, Memory 1 hints at the friendly relationship between the speakers, which can help maintain the conversational tone.\n\nMemory 2, on the other hand, focuses extensively on jello and family traditions, which, although relevant earlier in the conversation, does not directly relate to skiing or outdoor activities and hence doesn't aid Speaker A in responding about skiing.\n\nChoice: 1"
