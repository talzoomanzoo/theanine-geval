Speaker B has an oldest nephew who is about to turn 14.\n2. Both Speaker A's mother and Speaker A were librarians, but Speaker A is retired. Speaker B asks if the recommended book is fiction or nonfiction.\n3. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one. Speaker A, a retired librarian, recommends the book \"Beautiful Ruins\" by Jess Walter for a beach visit.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: To respond appropriately to Speaker A's question about Speaker B's nephew, it would be helpful to have specific information about Speaker B's nephew, such as his age or any relevant details that were discussed in previous dialogues. MEMORY 2 contains such specific information indicating that Speaker B has an oldest nephew who is about to turn 14, which directly relates to Speaker A's inquiry about the nephew. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, focuses on Speaker A's reflections on her youngest grandchild but does not provide any relevant information about Speaker B's nephew.\n\nChoice: 2"
