    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories provide context for the ongoing arrangement of Speaker B visiting Speaker A. MEMORY 1 offers specific evidence about activities and trips during summer in Alaska, which directly relates to Speaker B's question about renting a car and the possibility of walking or biking. MEMORY 2, while it also outlines intentions of visiting and enjoying a concert, includes information less pertinent to the current question regarding transportation options. \n\nChoice: 1"
