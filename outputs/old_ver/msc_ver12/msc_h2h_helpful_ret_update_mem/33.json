    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT indicates that Speaker A is looking for suggestions on what to play next, explicitly mentioning a preference for non-scary games. In this scenario, MEMORY 1 contains relevant information because it mentions Speaker B's enjoyment of games besides Resident Evil, such as League of Legends, which is not a horror game. This piece of information could help Speaker B provide a suggestion in line with Speaker A's preferences.

Therefore, MEMORY 1's details on the types of games Speaker B enjoys is more useful and relevant for providing suitable game suggestions to Speaker A.\n\nChoice: 1"
