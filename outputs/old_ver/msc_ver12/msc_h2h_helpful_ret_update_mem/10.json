    "prediction": "Explanation: The last utterance from Speaker B asks if Speaker A will be getting a free dessert with their meal. To respond appropriately, information about the perks or benefits that Speaker A receives from working at the restaurant would be relevant. MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 both mention that Speaker A gets two free meals per week and takes home leftover baked goods, which implies access to free food, including potentially dessert. However, MEMORY 2 provides additional context about Speaker A owning a separate restaurant and enjoying their interactions at work, although these points are less directly relevant to the current conversation about desserts. \n\nMEMORY 1 contains concise and relevant information regarding the benefits of the job without introducing unrelated details, making it slightly more helpful in addressing the specific question about free dessert.\n\nChoice: 1"
