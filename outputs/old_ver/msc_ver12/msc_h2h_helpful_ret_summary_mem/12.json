Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\n3. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n4. Speaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\n5. Speaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\n6. Speaker A is studying computer science and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science, and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics. \nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities. \nSpeaker B majoring in linguistics causes Speaker A to be interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context involves a conversation around teaching and career choices. Speaker B is considering teaching after talking with their advisor, and Speaker A expresses an interest in teaching robotics someday. Relevant information would thus pertain to teaching, career aspirations, and the academic interests of both speakers. MEMORY 1 provides information about both speakers' academic interests and aspirations (such as Speaker A's interest in robotics and their work to pay for school) and Speaker B's interest in linguistics and potentially becoming a professor. \n\nWhile MEMORY 2 contains similar information, it is repetitive and includes a seemingly unrelated point about Speaker A's robotics interest being influenced by Speaker B's linguistics major, which doesn't align with the context. This makes MEMORY 1 not only more concise and relevant but also devoid of inaccurate associations.\n\nChoice: 1"
