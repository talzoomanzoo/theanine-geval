This suggests Speaker B is concerned about transportation and climate. Memory 1 contains relevant information about the local conditions and prior experiences of Speaker A, such as the Alaska trip, which may provide insights into climate and transportation. Memory 2 focuses more on planning activities and concert details but does not directly address the current inquiry about transportation or climate.\n\nChoice: 1"
