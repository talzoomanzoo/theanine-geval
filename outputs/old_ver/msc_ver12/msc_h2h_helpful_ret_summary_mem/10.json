    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is about Speaker A's excitement over a new dish added to the restaurant menu where they work, and whether they could get a free dessert alongside it. The relevant information would relate to the free meal benefit Speaker A has, which is mentioned in both memories. \n\nMemory 1 includes pertinent details about Speaker A's work-free meals and mentions taking home leftover baked goods, which could relate to desserts. It also gives fuller context about Speaker A's work environment and schedule.\n\nMemory 2 mentions the same free meal information but adds unrelated details about ownership and a fire incident. The interaction is relevant but does not contribute directly to the immediate question about free dessert and therefore has less direct relevance to the query.\n\nChoice: 1"
