Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \nSpeaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!).\nSpeaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol\nSpeaker B: I am up for the challenge! I have a few tricks up my sleeve to deal with people like you.\nSpeaker A: Oh geez that makes me sound difficult.lol  Do you have any new speeches coming up?\nSpeaker B: Nope, I just cleared my schedule until the Alps marathon that you're training for. It's just you and me until you break that finish line. I'm going to start sending you a motivational quote every morning at 4 am when I want you to wake up. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600.\n2. Speaker B has run a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding.\n3. Speaker A is training for marathons and seeking advice on how to recover.\n4. Speaker B is a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks.\n5. Speaker A is a runner who is working on improving their mile time and training for a marathon.\n6. Speaker B's job involves motivating people to be successful and follow their dreams.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nSpeaker B has run a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding. This experience led Speaker A to seek advice on how to recover from marathon training. Speaker A then invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and planning to meet at the beach at 0600. Speaker B got into motivational speaking because they needed it themselves to battle depression and anxiety, which was suggested by Speaker A to combine with something more active to avoid dwelling on negative thoughts. Speaker B, who travels frequently for work and misses their wife and kids, also finds solace in fishing and the outdoors, similar to their background in San Francisco.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context reveals that Speaker A is asking Speaker B about new speeches and mentions training for the Alps marathon. The relevant details for this context include Speaker B's experience with marathons, their motivational speaker background, and their connection to Speaker A in the context of running and training. Memory 1 highlights Speaker A's role as a runner and their involvement in marathon training, which is directly relevant to the Alps marathon reference. Memory 2 provides additional personal background information about Speaker B, such as their struggles with mental health and personal life details, which are less pertinent to the specific dialogue context focused on marathon training and motivational speaking.\n\nChoice: 1"
