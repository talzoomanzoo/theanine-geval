    "prediction": "Explanation: The Dialogue Context shows that the Mentee is feeling lonely in a new city and misses their old friends. The Mentor should be able to address this specific issue. Memory 2 provides relevant information that the Mentee has recently moved to a new city for a job, which is directly related to their current feeling of loneliness. Additionally, Memory 2 contains multiple points that indicate the Mentee has previously expressed gratitude, which might make the Mentor aware of previous conversations and support styles that could be helpful now. Memory 1 also mentions the job in the city and gratitude but mixes in less relevant information, making it less clear and focused.\n\nChoice: 2"
