Do you remember when we were working on that movie together and you were feeling really frustrated? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT ends with Co-worker B mentioning a time when Co-worker A was feeling really frustrated during a movie project. This part of the conversation suggests that a MEMORY discussing an experience related to working on a movie set, and possibly any challenges or growth that came from it, would be most relevant. MEMORY 1 touches on the idea of collaboration during the shoot and the bond and mutual respect the co-workers have towards each other, which is directly related. MEMORY 2 contains additional context about their initial meeting and Co-worker B's emphasis on learning and teamwork, which might make it slightly more insightful for the discussion at hand, especially in relation to overcoming frustration.\n\nChoice: 2"
