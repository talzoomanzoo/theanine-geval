This aligns with the conversation in the dialogue context regarding the husband's creative process and stepping out of his comfort zone. MEMORY 2 provides context on the husband's nervousness and the wife's supportive role, which is relevant to encourage the husband to take risks in his writing. In contrast, MEMORY 1, while containing relevant information about the husband's presentation and encouragement from the wife, includes irrelevant details about modern language, happiness, and movie knowledge, which do not enhance understanding of the current dialogue.\n\nChoice: 2"
