    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides specific details that are directly relevant to Classmates A's curiosity and penchant for taking risks, such as encountering a mysterious woman in a dark alley. This context can give Classmates B a possible logical route to explain why they might know something about Classmates A's past that was not directly disclosed by Classmates A. It also gives enough context about Classmates A's habits (taking the bus) that could relate to situations where information might get inadvertently revealed. MEMORY 1 lacks this direct connection and specific details regarding how Classmates B might have obtained information about Classmates A's past.\n\nChoice: 2"
