    "prediction": "Explanation: In the dialogue context, Co-worker A expresses a concern about Co-worker B not liking them in the past, which could be an indication of past stress in their relationship. Based on the memories, what Co-worker A is referring to is the past stress about their relationship with Co-worker B. MEMORY 1 specifically mentions that Co-worker A felt stressed about their relationship with Co-worker B and that Co-worker B advised them to control their emotions and discuss the issue. This detailed information about their relationship history and how Co-worker B provided guidance is directly relevant to Co-worker A's last statement in the dialogue about past stress. \n\nMEMORY 2, on the other hand, focuses more on Co-worker A's aspirations and growth, which is less relevant to responding to the specific statement about past relationship stress.\n\nChoice: 1"
