    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context revolves around secrecy and personal information that Classmates B knows about Classmates A, which Classmates A did not disclose to anyone. Neither memory directly addresses this particular situation, but MEMORY 2 is slightly more helpful because it hints at the importance of the bond between Classmates A and B. It indirectly suggests that opening up about personal matters could stem from mutual trust and friendships â€” Classmates A wanted to be friends with Classmates B due to their positive reputation and saw resilience as important. This could give context to the sense of trust Classmates A feels and why A would expect B to share what they know about A's past. MEMORY 1 lacks this relational and emotional context, making it less useful for Classmates B to formulate a relevant response.\n\nChoice: 2"
