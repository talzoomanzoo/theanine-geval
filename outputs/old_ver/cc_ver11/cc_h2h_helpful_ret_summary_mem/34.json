    "prediction": "Explanation: In the Dialogue Context, Co-worker B is reminding Co-worker A about a time when they were frustrated during a movie project. The focus here is on their past collaboration and the support Co-worker A received during a challenging time. MEMORY 2 references the collaboration and mutual respect during the shoot, reflecting on how their teamwork brought out the best in each other. This is directly related to the situation Co-worker B is referring to. On the other hand, MEMORY 1 includes information about learning from mistakes and working together, but it is less precise and does not directly connect to the frustration mentioned. Therefore, MEMORY 2 offers more relevant and actionable insights for Co-worker A to respond appropriately.\n\nChoice: 2"
