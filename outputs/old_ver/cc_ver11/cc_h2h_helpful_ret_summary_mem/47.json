Building the new house was challenging but rewarding for Neighbor A.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context ends with Neighbor B asking about the progress of a house project that Neighbor A is presumably undertaking. Therefore, any relevant memory should provide insights into this project and possibly how Neighbor A approaches such projects. MEMORY 1 provides a clear connection to the ongoing house project, indicating that Neighbor A enjoys building houses, that they started construction last week, and have plans to finish it quickly. MEMORY 2, while containing some relevant information, also includes extraneous details about plants that do not pertain to the house project, making it less focused.\n\nChoice: 1"
