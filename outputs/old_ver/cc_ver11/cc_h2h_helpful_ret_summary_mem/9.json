    "prediction": "Explanation: The focus of the dialogue context is about Classmate A's passion for carpentry and how they got into it. Memory 1 includes that Classmates A wants to get to know Classmate B better, which could lead to more conversation between them, and includes supportive interactions. However, it does not relate directly to carpentry or how Classmate A got into it. Memory 2 provides background on Classmate A's business ventures and interests, including attending a seminar, which could be tangentially related to skills learned as a carpenter, but primarily discusses unrelated aspirations in singing and politics. Neither memory directly addresses the question about how Classmate A got into carpentry, but Memory 1 is slightly more helpful as it includes potential for continuing a supportive dialogue about career aspirations.\nChoice: 1"
