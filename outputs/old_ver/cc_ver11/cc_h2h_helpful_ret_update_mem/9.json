    "prediction": "Explanation: In the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, Classmates B is asking Classmates A how they got into carpentry. Memory 1 doesn't provide any specific information about how Classmate A got into carpentry. Memory 2 mentions Classmate A's aspiration to become a singer, but just like Memory 1, it doesn't directly address the question about how they started in carpentry. Thus, neither of the memories provides relevant information about the path that Classmate A took to get into carpentry. Therefore, neither memory is more helpful in addressing Classmate B's query.\n\nChoice: tie"
