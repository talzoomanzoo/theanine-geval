    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context shifts from a conversation about cheating on taxes to a reference about a past conversation where Classmates A talked about wanting to become a professional basketball player. Classmates B needs to respond in a way that acknowledges this shift and possibly connects Classmate A's ambitions with their current issues. Memory 1 provides more helpful information for Classmates B to craft a response that relates to Classmate A's goals, specifically by mentioning advice from Classmate B to stay focused on the goal, believe in oneself, and ask for help. This would provide Classmates B with an angle to approach Classmates A's current dilemma constructively. \n\nChoice: 1"
