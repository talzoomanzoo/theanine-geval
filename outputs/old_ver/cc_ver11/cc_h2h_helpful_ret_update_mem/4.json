I don't want you to get overwhelmed.\nCo-workers B: That's really nice of you, but I don't want to burden you with my work.\nCo-workers A: It's not a burden if it's something I can do to support you. Plus, helping you out makes me feel good too.\nCo-workers B: You're right, thank you. You always go above and beyond to help me out.\nCo-workers A: That's what co-workers are for. We're a team and we need to support each other.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of teamwork, remember when you showed me your plans for the future a few months ago? I'm still excited about the idea of working on a project together. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1. Co-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A.\n2. Co-worker A feels motivated about the future and is excited to work with Co-worker B.\n3. Co-worker B is impressed with Co-worker A's well-thought-out plans for their partnership.\n4. Co-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to prioritize their health.\n5. Co-worker B agrees that their skill sets complement each other well.\n6. Co-workers A and B have a positive and optimistic attitude towards their future collaboration.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nCo-worker A has been feeling off lately, but is grateful to Co-worker B for letting them borrow the horse and is having a great time riding her. This has motivated Co-worker A about the future and they are excited to work with Co-worker B. Co-worker B, who offered help and support to Co-worker A, is glad the trade worked out well for both of them. Additionally, Co-worker B is impressed with Co-worker A's well-thought-out plans for their partnership. Both co-workers believe they have the potential to create something great together.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context is centered around support and teamwork, especially how Co-worker A has consistently been supportive to Co-worker B, and their excitement about future collaborations. Memory 1 directly addresses Co-worker B's recognition of Co-worker A's plans and their positive attitude towards collaboration, which aligns with the dialogue. Memory 2 introduces an irrelevant detail about borrowing a horse, which detracts from the context's focus, making it less helpful.\n\nChoice: 1"
