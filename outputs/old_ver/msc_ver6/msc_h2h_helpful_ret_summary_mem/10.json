    "prediction": "Explanation: Speaker B's question about the possibility of getting a free dessert is related to the benefits and perks that Speaker A receives at their restaurant job, such as free meals. Therefore, the helpfulness of the memory relies on the inclusion of this specific information about Speaker A's work benefits. Memory 1 includes this information explicitly in point 1, mentioning that Speaker A gets two free meals per week, which directly relates to the question of a free dessert. Memory 2 also includes this information in point 1, but it does not have additional context that would make it more relevant or useful for this particular dialogue. Both memories contain the necessary information to address the question, but Memory 1 is slightly more concise without irrelevant details.\n\nChoice: 1"
