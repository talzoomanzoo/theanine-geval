Any must sees while I am there? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A's cousin recently moved to Sweden, which has sparked Speaker A's interest in visiting the country. This desire to visit Sweden is leading Speaker A to consider saving money by taking on a second part-time job. Additionally, Speaker B, who is from Sweden, suggested checking out the volcanoes in the country for a unique experience.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3.

Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n6. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides specific and relevant information about Speaker A's interest in visiting Sweden and mentions Speaker B's knowledge of the country, suggesting checking out the volcanoes for a unique experience. This directly addresses Speaker A's request for must-see attractions. MEMORY 2, while it provides a broader context about both speakers' circumstances and opinions on Sweden, does not directly offer relevant suggestions or experiences about must-sees in Sweden, making it less immediately useful for the current conversational context.\n\nChoice: 1"
