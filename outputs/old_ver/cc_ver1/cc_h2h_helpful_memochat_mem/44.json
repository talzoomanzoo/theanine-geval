MEMORY 2 offers detailed information about previous dialogues concerning Classmate A's basketball dream, including their doubts, efforts, and Classmate B's supportive response. This memory provides a richer understanding of the past discussions and emotional context around Classmate A's ambition. On the other hand, MEMORY 1 gives a general overview of A's goals and work ethic but lacks the depth of specific interactions and guidance from Classmate B that MEMORY 2 provides.\n\nChoice: 2"
