Have you ever been there? ### Mentee: No, I haven't. But I've always wanted to go. I heard the food and the scenery are amazing. ### Mentor: Yes, the food is definitely something to experience. But I have to admit, I'm glad I was able to leave Italy and come to the United States. ### Mentee: Why is that? ### Mentor: I was born and raised in a very restrictive religious community. It was hard to break free from the rules and expectations that were placed on me. That's actually why I became a mentor - to help others who may be going through a similar situation. ### Mentee: That's interesting. It's actually something that I've been thinking about lately. You know how we talked about escaping the abusive cult a few months ago? Well, I was thinking about how I want to help others who may be in that situation, too. ### Mentor: That's a great idea. Teaching religion or spiritual beliefs can be a way to help people feel connected to something bigger than themselves and give them a set of values to live by. ### Mentee: Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking. I just want to do something to make a positive impact in people's lives. Thanks for always being there to talk to, Mentor.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nMentee: Mentor, have you ever tried to imagine what it would be like to think like someone else? ###Mentor: Yes, I have.
