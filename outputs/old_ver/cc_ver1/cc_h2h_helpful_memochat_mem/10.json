    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 is more helpful because it directly addresses several key themes from the dialogue, such as the importance of effective communication, appreciation of Co-worker A's competence by their peers, the significance of repairing friendships, and thoughtful gestures like returning a watch and giving a baby doll and rattle. These aspects are relevant as they pertain to the recent exchanges and friendship dynamics, allowing Co-worker A to recall specific positive interactions and contributions, and encouraging continued team synergy and kindness.\n\nMEMORY 2, while also related to personal interactions and memories, does not add additional context or details that significantly enhance the immediate dialogue. It includes a dialogue that is more about an unrelated purchase and childhood memories, which doesn't directly impact the current context of recounted friendship achievements and thoughtful actions.\n\nChoice: 1"
