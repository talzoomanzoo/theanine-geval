This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn.\nTeacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation?\nStudent: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle.\nTeacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time?\nStudent: Really? Maybe I should try to build up my tolerance then.\nTeacher: It could be worth a try. Speaking of trying new things, how's your language studying going?\nStudent: It's going pretty well. I started with French, but now I'm considering taking up Spanish and German too. I want to become more well-rounded.\nTeacher: That's a great goal. Have you thought about any specific ways you could use your language skills?\nStudent: I would love to be able to travel more and speak with the locals in their native language. Maybe I could even teach my grandchildren some basic phrases.\nTeacher: Speaking of your grandchildren, how's your retirement planning going?\nStudent: It's going well. I'm really looking forward to spending more time with them and taking them on fun trips.\nTeacher: That sounds like a great plan. Speaking of fun, remember when you scared me in the hallway a few days ago? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nThe student had a heroic experience at the beach where they helped save a young kid from drowning. This event has made the student eager to retire and spend quality time with their grandchildren. Additionally, the student is currently studying French at college and intends to learn Spanish and German to become more well-rounded in language skills.\n\nThe teacher praised the student for their bravery and quick action in the emergency situation. This positive reinforcement may have contributed to the student feeling stressed lately, which could have led to the outburst. Furthermore, the student is excited about retiring and spending time with their grandkids, already planning fun activities.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Learning new languages', 'Related Summaries': 'Student shares enthusiasm for learning French, considering studying Spanish and German as well to broaden language skills.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Student: Hi, Teacher.

    "prediction": "Explanation: The memory choice needs to provide relevant context to the ongoing conversation, which has shifted to a lighter, personal anecdote about a previous interaction in the hallway. While both memories provide context related to the student's language learning progress and future plans (which were part of the dialogue), Memory 1 also touches on a personal story of a heroic act by the student, who is planning to retire soon, which connects to the theme of fun trips with grandchildren. However, it does not address the specific mention of the hallway incident.\n\nMemory 2 focuses more on the student's enthusiasm for learning new languages and expanding their skills, which was relevant to prior parts of the conversation, but does not directly assist with responding to the Teacher's reminder of the hallway incident.\n\nChoice: 1"
