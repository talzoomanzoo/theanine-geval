    "prediction": "Explanation: Both memories contain relevant information about the mentee's focus on living in the moment, connection to life, and their journey of sobriety. However, MEMORY 1 highlights the mutual appreciation and support between the mentor and mentee, particularly emphasizing the role of the mentor in the mentee's journey to sobriety, which directly relates to the dialogue context where the mentee expresses gratitude for the mentor's guidance and talks about their recent focus on living in the moment. This makes MEMORY 1 slightly more connected to the most recent turn of the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 1"
