    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context involves the Mentee expressing feelings of loneliness in a new city and missing old friends. MEMORY 1 includes specific elements that have more direct relevance to the feeling of being in a new city, as it includes a reference to the Mentee deciding to take a job in the city. This indicates an understanding of the transition and adjustment process, which would help the Mentor address the Mentee's feelings of loneliness. MEMORY 2, while providing a broader and more comprehensive view of the Mentee's background and accomplishments, does not directly address the issue of adapting to a new city or feeling lonely.\n\nChoice: 1"
