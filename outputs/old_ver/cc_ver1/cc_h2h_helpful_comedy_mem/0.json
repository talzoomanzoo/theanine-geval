    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 2 provides a detailed context about the relationship between the Parent and Child, as well as specific events related to the Parent's experience in detention. This directly relates to the Child's question about whether the Parent felt unheard during their time in detention, offering the parent a basis to respond about their past experiences and the emotional significance of small moments, like watching the sunrise. MEMORY 1, while it mentions the Parent's past mistakes and finding hope, does not provide the same depth of context regarding the specific experiences in detention or the relationship dynamics.\n\nChoice: 2"
