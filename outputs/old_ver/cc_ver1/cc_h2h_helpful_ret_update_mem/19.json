Have you considered looking for a new job?\nNeighbors A: I have, but with the current job market, it's really tough. Plus, I don't have a lot of experience in other fields.\nNeighbors B: Well, I'll keep an ear out for any job openings that might be a good fit for you. In the meantime, maybe try finding ways to de-stress after work? I find that exercise helps me when I'm feeling frustrated. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbor A mentioned the importance of keeping outside spaces clean and maintained for the future.

It highlights the supportive and understanding nature of Neighbors B, which aligns with the current conversation about Neighbors A's frustration at work. Additionally, it notes the positive relationship between the neighbors, which informs the supportive suggestion from Neighbors B about de-stressing. Memory 1, on the other hand, focuses more on outdoor spaces and past help with the lawn, which is less related to the current job-related conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
