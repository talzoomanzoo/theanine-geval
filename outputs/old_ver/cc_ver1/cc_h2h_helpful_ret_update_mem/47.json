Thanks for the advice.\nNeighbors B: No problem. Speaking of goals, how's the house project coming along?  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbor A built a new house for Neighbor B with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard. This act of kindness helped Neighbor B in creating a new house with amazing features.

    "prediction": "Explanation: In the dialogue context, Neighbor B asks about Neighbor A's progress with the house project, an inquiry that pertains to ongoing or recently concluded efforts to build or improve a home. MEMORY 1 directly mentions the construction of a new house by Neighbor A for Neighbor B, detailing features such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, which aligns closely with the house project topic. This provides relevant context for the ongoing conversation about reaching goals and working on projects.\n\nMEMORY 2 contains a variety of topics, such as community events and gardening skills, but only briefly mentions Neighbor A building a house for Neighbor B. However, it does offer insight into Neighbor A considering using their skills positively, which somewhat connects to the ongoing dialogue's mention of focusing on goals and finishing projects.\n\nChoice: 1"
