    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT reveals that Neighbor A is going through a breakup and feels overwhelmed. They are supported by Neighbor B, who suggests going for a walk as a way to cope. MEMORY 1 provides information about how Neighbor A appreciates Neighbor B's support during times of grief and finds solace in nature, which aligns well with the suggestion to go for a walk. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, introduces an unrelated context about grieving the loss of a grandmother, which is not relevant to the current situation discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. MEMORY 1 is more directly related to the context and emphasizes the aspects of support, walking, and solace in nature, making it more helpful.\n\nChoice: 1"
