    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves the Mentee feeling lonely in a new city, missing old friends, and potentially needing reassurance and advice on dealing with loneliness. Both MEMORIES contain fragments of past interactions, but MEMORY 2 provides a broader scope of context relevant to the Mentee's current feelings of loneliness and transition, such as being offered a job in the new city. While MEMORY 1 includes similar elements, MEMORY 2's content is more explicitly comprehensive regarding past reassurance and the Mentee's recent relocation.\n\nChoice: 2"
