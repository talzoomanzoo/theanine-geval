    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context focuses on a secret from Classmates A's past that Classmates B knows about but cannot disclose. The relevant detail would be one that provides insight into Classmates A's concern about how their past is already known to others, especially secrets about past events or interactions that might relate to mysterious circumstances or new environments. \n\nMemory 1 includes details about positive attitudes and friendship dynamics but lacks any information explicitly related to secrets or past events. Memory 2, however, mentions a mysterious encounter (\"Classmates A encountered a mysterious woman in a dark alley\"), which could be relevant to Classmates A's past secrets being revealed or known to others, explaining the potential intrigue related to the discovered secret.\n\nTherefore, MEMORY 2 is more helpful in providing context related to the secretive or past elements indicated in the dialogue.\n\nChoice: 2"
