It's the small acts of kindness that can make the biggest impact. Remembers when we talked about how I made sure the mix-up won't happen again? That was because I wanted to make a small impact, like you did for your neighbor. \n\nMEMORY 1:\n1.

Classmates A and B value their friendship and feel comfortable talking to each other about anything.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Classmates B mentioned a mix-up in the conversation, and MEMORY 2 directly addresses this by indicating that Classmates B handled a previous mix-up with the class schedule well. This provides context for Classmates B's reference to a past event where they resolved an issue, which supports the connection made in the dialogue about making a small impact. Additionally, MEMORY 2 contains more detailed context about the relationship and previous supportive interactions between Classmates A and B, which aligns with the theme of kindness and support discussed in the dialogue. MEMORY 1, on the other hand, lacks specific details related to the mix-up and offers less relevant context.\n\nChoice: 2"
