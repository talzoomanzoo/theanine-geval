    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 is consistent as it does not contain information that contradicts the past memories or the current conversation. It focuses on confirming travel plans based on airfare and intends to inform Speaker A when the flights are booked.\n\nResponse 2 is inconsistent with the past memories as it mentions being excited to attend the folk music concert in about 4 weeks, but there has been no confirmation on when Speaker B is visiting. Speaker B is waiting for the flight prices to decrease, so committing to a time frame lacks consistency with the reality of them not having booked flights yet.\n\nChoice: 1"
