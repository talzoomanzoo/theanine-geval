    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are generally consistent with the past memories and current conversation. However, Response 1 accurately addresses Speaker B's timeline for graduation, which is consistent with the fact that Speaker B is a college student. Response 2 is more general about when Speaker B hopes to graduate (\"hoping to graduate soon\"), which does not directly specify as Response 1 does. Therefore, Response 1 is more consistent with the detail provided about Speaker B being in college.\n\nChoice: 1"
