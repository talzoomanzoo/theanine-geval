    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses are consistent with the past memories and the current conversation. Speaker A acknowledges that they haven't done therapy before, which aligns with the fact that they mainly know about horses and don't know much about psychology. Both responses also reflect Speaker B's love for helping people and how they find their job rewarding. Additionally, both responses acknowledge the challenges in the therapy profession, which Speaker B has mentioned in the past. Response 1 introduces a topic related to Speaker B's practice, which is consistent with Speaker B having their own practice. Response 2 highlights the impact of Speaker B's work and their qualifications, which doesn't contradict any past memories. Both responses are consistent, making it difficult to choose one over the other.\n\nChoice: tie"
