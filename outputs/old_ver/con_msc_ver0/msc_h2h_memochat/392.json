I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. \nSpeaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me.\nSpeaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house.  \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I completely understand your concern. It's important to keep a safe distance from wild animals, especially if they could potentially cause harm or carry diseases.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: It's important to be cautious with wild animals like raccoons to prevent any potential risks, especially if they might carry diseases. It's good that you're taking steps to handle the issue with the aluminum sheeting.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",

They acknowledge the potential risks and concerns of having wild raccoons around, which aligns with Speaker A's concerns about raccoons being diseased.
