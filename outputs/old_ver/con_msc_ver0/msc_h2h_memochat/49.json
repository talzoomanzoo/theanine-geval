Thank you for offering your services to me, I appreciate it.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 is not consistent with past memories as it implies that Speaker B, a therapist, offers therapy services to Speaker A, which contradicts the fact that it is illegal for Speaker B to have relationships with clients. Response 2, on the other hand, stays general and does not directly imply that Speaker B would take Speaker A as a client, thus maintaining consistency with the past memory that Speaker B is a professional who cannot have relationships with clients.\n\nChoice: 2"
