It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \nSpeaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: My next final is in math. I'm trying to study extra hard for it.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: That's true, having a good teacher can make a big difference in your grades. My next final is on biology. I've been studying hard for it, so hopefully, it goes well.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Neither response contradicts the past memories directly. However, there is no information provided in the past memories specifically indicating what subjects Speaker A is taking (besides gym, which they are good at, and history, which they find boring). Therefore, neither response introduces contradicting information and both can be consistent with the details given.\n\nChoice: tie"
