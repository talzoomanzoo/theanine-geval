I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. \nSpeaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me.\nSpeaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house. \nSpeaker B: Understandable. Have you ever tried contacting animal control? That's how I got Bandicoot. I was working that day and animal control came by explaining about needing fosters for raccoons. I thought it was weird, so I did it and began to work at the small raccoon cafe that is part of the zoo. I love it. \nSpeaker A: That is a good idea.  Maybe they could help move them to a safer area.  I have a lot of traffic around and they could get hit if they are coming to my place all the time.  Have you been able to teach your raccoon any tricks?\nSpeaker B: The only trick I was able to teach him, that I deeply regret, was how locks worked. I thought it was cool at first, you know, to see a raccoon unlock a door. And now, I regret it so much. I've had to change the layout of my apartment and put deadbolts on my doors so that Bandicoot can't get out. And, he is sneaky about it. One time, he unlocked the pantry and was eating some cookies! It's like having a toddler that never grows up.\nSpeaker A: That is bad I guess.  Do you keep all of your chemicals, poisons, and medications up and locked?  I would hate to think what might happen if Bandicoot got into any of that.  Hey, when you drive do you lock him up in a cage or let him wander around in the car?  That could be dangerous for you driving and he freaks out. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I do keep everything locked up for safety. Bandicoot usually stays in a secured carrier while we're driving to avoid any distractions. It's important to keep both of us safe on the road.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: I've made sure to childproof my apartment as much as possible, especially when it comes to dangerous items. I keep all chemicals, poisons, and medications securely locked away in cabinets Bandicoot can't access. As for car rides, I have a designated secure carrier for him. It's definitely safer for both of us that way, especially since Bandicoot can get a little too curious during drives.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses 1 and 2 are consistent with the past memories. They both acknowledge that Bandicoot requires safety measures due to his intelligence and curiosity. Whether in the apartment (Response 2) or during car rides (both responses), Speaker B ensures that Bandicoot is securely contained to prevent accidents. The mention of keeping dangerous items locked up aligns with the precautions discussed in the past memories of Bandicoot being a clever raccoon. Both responses are consistent as they align with the known behavior and care requirements for Bandicoot without introducing conflicting information.\n\nChoice: tie"
