I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week?\nSpeaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day\nSpeaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through\nSpeaker A: Actually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to it. Do you think I will need to rent a car when I'm there, or is it possible to walk and bike in the summer? I always picture huge amounts of snow but I'm not sure if it's like that all year round.\nSpeaker A: I would definitely recommend looking for a rental car to have on hand. There is a town within walking distance from me, but it can be dangerous to walk with the wolves and elk around, especially at night.\nSpeaker B: I imagine so!!! I wouldn't want to run into a wolf! Ok. I will add car rental to my plans. Do you get scared with your dogs, that you will run into wildilfe like that?\nSpeaker A: I think I'm more afraid of the wildlife than my dogs are. If I had to, I think I could muster the courage to face the animals out here, but I will happily avoid them when possible. With you around, I'd feel much better, as well. How do you feel about being that close to wildlife? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I'm a bit nervous, but I think with you by my side, I'll feel more at ease. It'll definitely be an adventure!\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B: I'm excited to experience the wildlife up close, especially seeing elk and wolves! It adds a thrill to the whole adventure. I'm sure with you by my side, we'll navigate it all just fine.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: Both response options are consistent with the past memories. Speaker B has expressed interest in experiencing Alaska's wildlife, including wolves, and both responses align with this curiosity. However, Response 1 acknowledges the nervousness associated with encountering wildlife, matching Speaker B's cautious tone about \"not wanting to run into a wolf\" earlier in the conversation. Response 2 remains consistent by expressing excitement about the wildlife adventure, but it might downplay Speaker B's previously expressed caution. Overall, both responses could fit Speaker B's character and prior statements, leaning towards different interpretations of the same sentiment.\n\nChoice: tie"
