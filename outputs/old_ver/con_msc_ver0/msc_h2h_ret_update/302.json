    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 incorrectly suggests that Speaker B has tried incorporating bone broth and turmeric into their diet, which contradicts the current conversation where Speaker B only mentioned liking crab legs and shrimp. On the other hand, Response 2 is consistent because it introduces the concept of bone broth in a more general way, asking if Speaker B has ever tried it without assuming prior knowledge or use.\n\nChoice: 2"
