Where are you going on vacation?\nSpeaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there!\nSpeaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo?\nSpeaker B: Their zoo is pretty good! It's always crowded, of course, but they have pandas so I'm happy. I would say it's bigger than the DC zoo, but I like that the DC zoo has fewer people.\nSpeaker A: That sounds awesome.  I haven't been to the zoo in so long.  I wish I could go.\nSpeaker B: You should go with your sister! she can bring her dog. They probably have all kinds of exotic birds...\nSpeaker A: That's a great idea!  I'm not sure how good her dog would do around other animals though.  She always barks like crazy whenever she sees any kind of animal.\nSpeaker B: Oh, that's a good point. Maybe keep her away from the small rodent house and reptiles, eh? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that's probably a good idea. I'll suggest that to her. Thanks for the tip!\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A: Definitely, we wouldn't want any chaos at the zoo with the dog barking up a storm. Maybe we can stick to the panda and penguin areas.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: In the past memories, it is mentioned that Speaker B's girlfriend enjoys pandas and penguins at the zoo, and both Speaker A and Speaker B go to the zoo to see these animals. Speaker A mentions that Speaker A's sister has a yellow lab, and there is no mention of Speaker A's sister having a dog allowed in the current conversation. Response 2 suggests that Speaker A's sister could bring her dog to see pandas and penguins. However, the introduction of specific sections of the zoo conflicts with Speaker A's concern about her sister's dog barking at animals and potentially causing chaos, particularly in an environment where animals related to Speaker B's girlfriend's interest are housed.\n\nChoice: 1"
