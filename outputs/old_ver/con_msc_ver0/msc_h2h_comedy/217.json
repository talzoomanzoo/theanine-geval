I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field?\nSpeaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate?\nSpeaker B: I have another year- so this year is really important I get internships and start making connections in the field.   I love going to the beach too.  What happened with your knees that now cause you so much pain?\nSpeaker A: I think age has really been my knees downfall. I also used to hike a lot and I put a lot of pressure on my legs. That is great that you only have a year. Maybe when you graduate you can come hang out on the beach with me. I can't surf but I would love to watch you.\nSpeaker B: That would be fun!  I like collecting shells too so we could do that as well.  I have a small collection of ones I have from around the world.  The farthest away was from Greece.  Have you traveled a lot?\nSpeaker A: I have. I love Europe. I have been to many countries there but I have not gone to Greece yet. I would love to. The scenery and architecture is amazing. Have you gotten to visit other European countries?\nSpeaker B: I have.   I have also been to France and Ireland.  Where have you been in Europe?\nSpeaker A: Oh gosh. I have been to France, England, Ireland, Switzerland, Austria, Poland, Germany, Leichenstein, Spain, and much of Mexico, and Bermuda. I just love to travel but I have not been able to recently and with my knees I cannot sit in coach anymore and first class is so expensive. Do you plan on settling any place in particular once you graduate? \nSpeaker B: That's awesome you have been so many places!   I  am not sure where I will setlle down after graduation.  It probably will depend whether I decide to go further in my education or not and I have any residency requirements with that.   I do like the heat though so  hopefully somewhere sunny!\nSpeaker A: Oh I forgot my most favorite place- Italy. I am sure you will have so many opportunities when you graduate. You will have people knocking down your door. You could go anywhere with that degree. WOuld you like Florida? I personally cannot deal with that much heat but sounds like you would like it there. My brother lives in Cape Coral on one of the canals and he loves it. Other than FLorida what other warm place would you like? \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker B: I've always dreamed of visiting Australia or Hawaii. The beaches and outdoor activities there seem incredible. What about you? Any warm places you'd like to explore next?\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B:  It's great to hear that you enjoy going to the beach too! I used to surf when I was younger, and actually, I've been thinking about taking out my old surfboard and hitting the waves again. It's never too late to get back into something you love, right? Let's plan a surfing day together once you graduate and we can collect some shells too. I'm sure we'll have a blast!\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nIn the past memories, it is mentioned that Speaker B is a beginner surfer currently getting help from friends and that Speaker A used to surf when they were younger and is trying to get back into it. However, Response 2 incorrectly states that Speaker B used to surf when they were younger, which contradicts the memories indicating they are currently a beginner surfer. Response 1 does not contradict any past memories, as Speaker B has not specifically expressed a past desire to visit Australia or Hawaii, and their interest in warm places aligns with the current conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
