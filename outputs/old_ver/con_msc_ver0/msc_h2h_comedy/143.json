    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 is consistent with the past memories as it stays general and doesn't introduce any new information that might contradict previous knowledge. Speaker B's daughter likes the zoo and particularly the monkeys, and it is credible that she would enjoy a trip and want to go again. Response 2 introduces contradictory information. It mistakenly assumes Speaker A has a daughter, which is not mentioned in the past memories, and thus it contradicts the context of the past discussions.\n\nChoice: 1"
