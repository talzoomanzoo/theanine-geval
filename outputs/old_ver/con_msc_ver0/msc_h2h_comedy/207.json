Response 1 is consistent with the past memories, as it acknowledges the opportunity in the sports medicine field and does not introduce any contradictory information. Response 2, while expressing enthusiasm, suggests that Speaker B will pass on the information to someone else, which does not align with the fact that the opportunity is meant for Speaker B. Additionally, it introduces an inconsistency by bringing up surfing in the context of sharpening reflexes for soccer, which is not a previously established memory or context within the conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
