    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 states that Speaker B can't wait to experience beautiful weather in Alaska, which contradicts the past memory where Speaker A said it's warm at their location, suggesting that the visit is not to Alaska but possibly somewhere with warm weather. Response 2, on the other hand, makes no direct claims about the current visit location being Alaska. It mentions keeping an eye on airfare for Alaska but also acknowledges enjoying sunshine during the current visit, which implies a different, likely warmer, location. Additionally, Speaker B's mention of trying egg benedict connects with their interest in eggs and doesn't contradict any past memories.\n\nChoice: 2"
