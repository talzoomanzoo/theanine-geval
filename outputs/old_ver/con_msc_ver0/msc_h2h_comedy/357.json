    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 1 is consistent with the past memories that indicate Speaker B has been playing a lot of League of Legends and has bought Resident Evil VIII, but hasn't played it yet this week. It also correctly reflects Speaker A's curiosity about trying Resident Evil. Response 2, while generally consistent, implies Speaker B plans to play Resident Evil with Speaker A next week, which is consistent with plans to play together. However, mentioning buying Resident Evil VIII now as if it was a recent purchase might be slightly inconsistent because it was already mentioned as a game Speaker B recently bought.\n\nChoice: 1"
