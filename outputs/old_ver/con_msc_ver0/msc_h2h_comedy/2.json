I can't wait to explore the rainforests and beaches!\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker B:  I'm glad you've been to Canada and Mexico, those must have been amazing trips! I plan to stay in Costa Rica for about two weeks, I'm really looking forward to exploring the rainforests and soaking up the sun on the beautiful beaches. Do you have any book recommendations for my beach visit?\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nBoth responses from Speaker B mention plans to explore the rainforests and beaches of Costa Rica. However, Response 1 states that Speaker B will be in Costa Rica for only about a week, while Response 2 claims it will be two weeks. Additionally, Response 2 includes a reference to books for a beach visit, which is consistent with the past memory of Speaker A recommending a book for such a purpose. There is no past memory information regarding the length of Speaker B's stay in Costa Rica, but both responses are plausible since there isn't any contradictory evidence in the past memories. Response 2 is slightly more detailed with the inclusion of a book recommendation query, which aligns with previous book discussions.\n\nChoice: tie"
