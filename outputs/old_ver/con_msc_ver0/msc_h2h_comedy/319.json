    "prediction": "Explanation: Response 1 is consistent because it acknowledges the rewarding nature of Speaker B's job, which aligns with the fact that Speaker B enjoys their work with computers. Response 2, however, introduces a contradiction by attributing a statement to Speaker A that was not made in the conversation or past memories - specifically, Speaker A's mother being mentioned or encouraging Speaker B. Thus, Response 2 is inconsistent with past memories and the current conversation.\n\nChoice: 1"
