Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\nSpeaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\nSpeaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\nSpeaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.\nSpeaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe?\nSpeaker B: There is some weird chemical mix that I really do not mess with.

I know what it should look like and that we want to keep everyone safe when using the fake blood. \n\nRESPONSE 1\nSpeaker A: That's smart to prioritize safety on set. It's great that you have a team that takes precautions seriously.\nRESPONSE 2\nSpeaker A:  I'm glad you find the process of making horror movies fascinating! It's definitely a unique and creative field to work in. As for your question about movie blood, I actually don't know the specific recipe for it. I try to stay away from that part of the movies and focus more on the creative aspects. It's important to make sure everyone stays safe on set, especially when using fake blood.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:\nExplanation:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 2 contradicts Speaker A's past memories wherein Speaker B mentioned they stay away from the fake blood part of movies and rather focus on creative aspects. However, the response inaccurately puts words in Speaker Aâ€™s mouth, suggesting that they do the same. In contrast, Response 1 aligns well with Speaker B's statement about prioritizing safety and does not introduce any inaccuracies about Speaker A's prior knowledge or involvement in movie-making.\n\nChoice: 1"
