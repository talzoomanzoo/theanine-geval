    "prediction": "Explanation: \nResponse 2 directly addresses the question posed by Speaker B about whether they build computers or work on programming, which shows consistency with the context of the conversation.

Response 1, however, does not provide any information that Speaker B works on the programming side or clarifies what they do at the computer company, therefore does not align as well with the stated memories or conversation.\n\nChoice: 2"
