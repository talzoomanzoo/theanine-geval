Have you seen any of those movies?\nSpeaker B: No I haven't seen any of those. What foods did you eat while watching the movie?\nSpeaker A: Wow, there are so many of the movies out there. Don't go see Black Widow without watching Avengers first. I had an amazing steak and vegetables on the side that were delicious.

Which vegetables do you feel are the best for healing? Are there any that should be avoided?\nSpeaker A: I feel that most leafy green vegetables are healthy, but it depends on the specific person's needs.
