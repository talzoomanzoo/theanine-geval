    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Speaker A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B, who does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies, wants Speaker A to teach them how to swim and programming. Speaker B also enjoys cruising in their car while listening to punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming. On the other hand, Speaker A, who enjoys cruising and has a favorite club in school, causes Speaker A to plan snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination. This leads to Speaker A and Speaker B discussing the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n2. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n3. Speaker A has planned to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n5. Speaker A is planning a snorkeling trip and has signed up for several trips.\n6. Speaker B is afraid of cruises because they can't swim.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides a more thorough background that supports the current conversation in the dialogue context. It acknowledges Speaker B's interest in learning how to swim and connecting that to their enjoyment of punk music while learning. It also captures the conversation direction towards cruising and the potential of participating in a cruise together. MEMORY 2 includes some relevant points but includes potentially conflicting information that Speaker B is afraid of cruises because they can't swim, which hasn't been introduced in the dialogue context. MEMORY 1, while still a bit verbose, keeps the elements of the conversation in line with the flow of discussion up to this point.\n\nChoice: 1"
