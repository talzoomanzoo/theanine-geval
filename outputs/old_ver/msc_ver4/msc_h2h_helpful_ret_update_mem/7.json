It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip?  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A is a librarian and loves kids, mentioning having 3 children. This makes Speaker A busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.

This led Speaker B to take their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1.

    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 1 provides context not just about Speaker B's enjoyment of spending time with their grandkids, but also alludes to Speaker B's idea of making fishing trips an annual tradition, which is specifically mentioned in the Dialogue Context. While Memory 2 also mentions some relevant points regarding the fishing trip and interest in nature, it is less detailed about the interactions with the grandkids outside the fishing context and doesn't cover the annual trip idea as cohesively. \n\nChoice: 1"
