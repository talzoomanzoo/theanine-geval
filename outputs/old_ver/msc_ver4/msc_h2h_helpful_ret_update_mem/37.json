Did you find the book sufficiently exciting? \nSpeaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far.\nSpeaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes. \nSpeaker A: why don't you like books like that?\nSpeaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker B's fascination with animals allows them to understand Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals. This is because Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves with technology or watching TV. Additionally, Speaker A enjoys watching movies with their grandchildren. Speaker B, on the other hand, has a young son and finds solace in reading books, especially those about animals. This interest in animals is shared with Speaker A, who mentions watching movies with their grandchildren.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Speaker B is fascinated by animals and can relate to Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals.\n2. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n3. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n4. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n5. Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves by using technology or watching TV.\n6. Speaker A was influenced by Alex Trebek and Ken Jennings to develop a love for books and reading.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: In the dialogue context, Speaker B expresses a preference for animal books over crime dramas and asks if there is a movie adaptation of the book Speaker A is reading. Thus, memory related to Speaker B's interest in animals is the most relevant and useful. Memory 2 contains distinct points about Speaker A's and Speaker B's preferences, specifically noting Speaker B's fascination with animals. Memory 1 summarizes the information but does not add any extra detail that directly addresses Speaker B's question about an adaptation movie or their interests in animals compared to Memory 2.\n\nChoice: 2"
