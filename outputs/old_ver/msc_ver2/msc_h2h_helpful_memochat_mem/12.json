I imagine your parents are so proud. \n\nMEMORY 1:\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science, and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics. \nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities. \nSpeaker B majoring in linguistics causes Speaker A to be interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Teaching and Career Paths', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B explore the idea of teaching and career options related to their fields.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: Yup I already volunteer at my mom's after school program. But I am looking to do more high level volunteering at the neighboring university in our town. Have you ever thought about maybe teaching at a college? ### Speaker A: Maybe community college, but it would have to courses in computer science.  I'd like to get involved with robotics. There is a lot of opportunity in this field and being able to teach it can really help advance my expertise. ### Speaker B: Yeah I feel like you could do so much with a computer science degree. It's really cool there are so many options! I feel a little bit stuck studying linguistics.

    "prediction": "Explanation: MEMORY 1 provides detailed speaker information such as Speaker A's part-time job, their field of study, and their career ambition to develop apps for differently-abled youth and teach computer science, specifically robotics. It also gives information about Speaker B considering a master's degree and aspirations to become a linguistics professor, mentioning their concerns about limited job opportunities. This information is directly relevant to the Dialogue Context, connecting to career choices and teaching aspirations.\n\nMEMORY 2, on the other hand, is more focused on summarizing related dialogues and topics without providing the same level of detailed personal information about either speaker. It lacks specific details about the speakers' backgrounds and current situations, which are provided in MEMORY 1.\n\nChoice: 1"
