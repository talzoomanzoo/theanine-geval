It's actually a foreign film so there are subtitles. What belt are you in Karate?  ### Speaker B: I'm a green belt.  Hmmm, subtitles, maybe not my favorite.  You say it's really good?  My significant other likes foreign films, but honestly, I tend to fall asleep during them. ### Speaker A: Yeah a lot of people don't like reading the movies they watch. I get it. Maybe put it on at bedtime so if you pass out it would be ok. How many years of Karate have you done? ### Speaker B: I've been doing Karate for a little over one year.  I wish I could be more consistent about it.  Sometimes it's hard to get to the classes.  I have so many other activities that keep from getting into class every week.  Especially since I'm trying to decide whether to go back to school or not. ### Speaker A: It's always good to go back to school but only if you have time for it. don't add more to your plate with something as important as schooling. What would you go back for?  ### Speaker B: I'm planning on going for a certificate in IT work.  I think it will pay more, and you know, I'm getting older and looking for a job that is a little less demanding physically.
