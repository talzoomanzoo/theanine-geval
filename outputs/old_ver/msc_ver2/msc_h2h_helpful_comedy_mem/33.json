There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you?\nSpeaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions? \n\nMEMORY 1:\n- Speaker B plays a lot of video games, specifically League of Legends, and owns a new gaming laptop. As a result, Speaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII.\n- Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World. Consequently, Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n- Speaker A prefers tamer video games and is not a fan of horror movies. This leads to Speaker A being hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World. In response, Speaker B mentions that Resident Evil can be scary and provides some tips for playing it.\n\nMEMORY 2:\nUser Description: Speaker A enjoys hunting deer in their free time and is concerned about deer overpopulation.

Speaker A mentioned that it may take bravery to play Resident Evil. Speaker B mentioned that Resident Evil is definitely scary and the UI is a little hard to get used to.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The goal is to choose the MEMORY that provides more detailed and relevant speaker information related to the dialogue context about video gaming preferences with an emphasis on Resident Evil and the type of games each speaker enjoys. MEMORY 1 provides detailed information on Speaker A's and Speaker B's gaming preferences, specifically related to Resident Evil and Speaker A's reluctance towards horror games. It also mentions Speaker B's insights on playing Resident Evil. In contrast, MEMORY 2 focuses more on additional activities such as hunting, which is less relevant to the dialogue context. While it provides some useful gaming context, it does not focus on the preferences as well as MEMORY 1 does. \n\nChoice: 1"
