    "prediction": "Explanation: Memory 2 provides a richer context about Speaker A and Speaker B's relationship, their personal goals, and other activities they are involved in outside of their academic pursuits. It illustrates their mutual support system and personal interests such as soccer and hiking, which are not mentioned in Memory 1. This added context is relevant to understanding Speaker B's offer to help Speaker A study and provides a fuller picture of their dynamics beyond academics. Memory 1, while touching on academic pressures and performance, offers less about the speakers' relationship and other aspects of their lives.\n\nChoice: 2"
