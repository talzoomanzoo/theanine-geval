    "prediction": "Explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT shows that Classmates A is concerned about how Classmates B found out about their past, and is seeking an explanation. The context requires information that could explain how Classmates B might know something about Classmates A. MEMORY 2 contains details such as Classmates A taking the bus and encountering a mysterious woman in a dark alley, which could potentially relate to how Classmates B learned something about Classmates A. These specific incidents provide more useful and relevant context to form a plausible explanation. On the other hand, MEMORY 1 focuses more on positivity, friendships, and general topics, which are less directly related to how Classmates B might have found out about Classmates A's past.\n\nChoice: 2"
