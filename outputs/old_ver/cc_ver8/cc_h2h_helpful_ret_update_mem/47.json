    "model_input": "Your task is to choose a more helpful MEMORY based on the below criterion.\n\nCRITERION:\nHelpfulness - The MEMORY should contain information that is both useful and relevant, enabling the Neighbors A to respond in an appropriate context to the last utterance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nExplanation: (a brief explanation)\nChoice: (answer with \"1\", \"2\", or \"tie\")\n\nNow choose the MEMORY that has better Helpfulness.\n\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination.\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off.\nNeighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks?\nNeighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else.\nNeighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location?\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home.\nNeighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become.\nNeighbors A: You're right, I need to stop making excuses and just get it done. Thanks for the advice.\nNeighbors B: No problem. Speaking of goals, how's the house project coming along?  \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbor A built a new house for Neighbor B with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard. This act of kindness helped Neighbor B in creating a new house with amazing features. Neighbor B expressed their appreciation by reminding Neighbor A of their potential to do good things, referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them. This made Neighbor A feel motivated to believe that plants need sunlight, water, and love to thrive. \n\nNeighbor A, who enjoys building houses and finishing them quickly, also possesses skills in manipulation and getting what they want. \n\nNeighbor B, excited about the new project, is looking forward to seeing the finished house. Building the new house was challenging but rewarding for Neighbor A.\n\nMEMORY 2:\n1. Neighbor A considers using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder.\n2. Neighbor A and Neighbor B discuss organizing a community event to make a positive impact and appreciate the beauty of their city.\n3. Neighbors A had help from friends in building the new house.\n4. Neighbor B has not been up to anything interesting lately but is excited about the new house and looking forward to it.\n5. Neighbor A considers Neighbor B a great neighbor and wanted to do something special for them.\n6. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's gardening skills and wishes to have a green thumb.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT:",
    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context involves a discussion about procrastination and setting goals, with a final mention of a house project. Memory 2, with its focus on neighborly cooperation, community events, and the mutual appreciation between Neighbors A and B, directly relates to the house project and the positive relationship dynamic introduced at the end of the dialogue. Memory 1, while it does mention the house-building project, includes less about Neighbor A and B's interaction and more about unrelated elements like Neighbor A's manipulation skills and plants, which are less relevant to the dialogue context.\n\nChoice: 2"
