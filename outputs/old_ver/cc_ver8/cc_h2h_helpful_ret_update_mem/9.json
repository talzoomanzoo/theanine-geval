    "prediction": "Explanation: The MEMORY that is more helpful should provide information relevant to the topic of carpentry and how Classmate A got into it. Both memories mention Classmates A's desire to start a business and work hard toward success, which can relate to a carpentry career if understood in a business context. However, MEMORY 1 contains a lot of unrelated information about singing and appreciation for the President that do not contribute to the context about carpentry. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, lists relevant points about Classmates A's aspirations and Classmates B's supportive nature. The possibility of support or collaboration from Classmates B is also mentioned, which may open a discussion on how Classmate A got into carpentry as a business.\n\nChoice: 2"
