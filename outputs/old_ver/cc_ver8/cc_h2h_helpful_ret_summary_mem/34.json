    "prediction": "Explanation: The dialogue context involves Co-worker A expressing gratitude towards a supportive boss and reflecting on a past frustrating experience while working on a movie. MEMORY 1 primarily focuses on the positive aspects of their collaboration and future projects, without directly addressing the theme of learning from past challenges. MEMORY 2, on the other hand, includes information about Co-worker A feeling remorse for past actions and Co-worker B's emphasis on learning from mistakes, which directly relates to the past frustrations mentioned in the dialogue. This makes MEMORY 2 more relevant and useful for continuing the conversation in an appropriate context.\n\nChoice: 2"
