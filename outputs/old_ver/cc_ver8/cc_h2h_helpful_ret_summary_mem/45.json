    "prediction": "Explanation: The current dialogue context is about discovering a perfect camping spot and how Classmates A found it. MEMORY 1 discusses the camping spot directly, highlighting its suitability and the features that make it desirable, like the level ground and absence of debris. This directly relates to Classmate B's question about how Classmate A found the spot. In contrast, MEMORY 2 does not directly address the camping spot or provide any relevant details that would enable Classmate B to respond appropriately to the question about the discovery of the camping spot. It instead focuses on their community involvement and past experiences, which are not immediately relevant to the context of finding the camping spot.\n\nChoice: 1"
