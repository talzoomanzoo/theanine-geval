I don't know how to move on from this.\nNeighbors B: It's going to take time, but you will get through this. Do you want to talk about how you're feeling or do something to take your mind off of things?\nNeighbors A: Maybe both? I just feel so overwhelmed and I don't know what to do.\nNeighbors B: How about we go for a walk and you can talk to me about everything that's been on your mind? \n\nMEMORY 1:\nNeighbor A recently moved to a new neighborhood and feels safer and happier there.

    "prediction": "Explanation: Both MEMORY 1 and MEMORY 2 provide context about Neighbor A and Neighbor B's relationship, which can be relevant when Neighbor B suggests going for a walk to help Neighbor A process their feelings. They both mention the support and companionship Neighbor B offers and the importance of walks and nature to Neighbor A, which directly relate to the suggestion of going for a walk and talking. However, MEMORY 2 provides an added specific context - the loss of Neighbor A's grandmother - which could help Neighbor B align their support accordingly, possibly making it slightly more helpful.\n\nChoice: 2"
