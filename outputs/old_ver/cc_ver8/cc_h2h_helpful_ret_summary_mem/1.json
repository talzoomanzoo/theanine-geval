    "prediction": "Explanation: The last utterance of the dialogue context indicates that the Mentee is feeling lonely in a new city and misses their old friends. The Mentor's response should ideally focus on providing emotional support or practical advice for dealing with loneliness and forming social connections in a new environment. \n\nIn both memory sets, point 2 suggests that the Mentee has decided to take a job in the new city, which is directly relevant to the current feeling of loneliness they are experiencing. However, MEMORY 2 also includes the information about the Mentor reassuring the Mentee that many students feel the same way (point 3), which could be used to comfort the Mentee regarding their loneliness, and point 4, which reflects the mentee's gratitude for the Mentor's guidance, which could be leveraged to bolster the current support.\n\nChoice: 2"
