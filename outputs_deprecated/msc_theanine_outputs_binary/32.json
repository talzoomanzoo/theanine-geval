That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\nSpeaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal.\nSpeaker B: That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab!\nSpeaker A: Oh! I did not know that. Well if you can clone cows that's more ice cream for you! Haha. What's your favorite ice cream flavor?\nSpeaker B: Yes, more ice cream is always good, haha! I like a good rocky road, or pretty much any chocolate ice cream with nuts or stir-ins! I like most of Jeni's brand too. How about you? What is your favorite kind?\nSpeaker A: I am a big fan of cookie dough ice cream, and I love cheesecake flavored ice creams too! Ben & Jerry has some that I like, but I prefer to get ice cream from an ice cream shop.  It's just something about being in that environment,\nSpeaker B: Yes, ice cream shops are the best! They have stir-ins, and the smells are heavenly! Ben and Jerry's used to have a blueberry cheesecake that was amazing! I have only had that and their strawberry flavors. Both were great!\nSpeaker A: YES! You get it. Now I want to go to an ice cream shop. I might apply for a part-time job at an ice cream shop since I'm not working.  Do you enjoy your job as a fry cook? I think the food & restaurant industries may be similar.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is interested in getting a dog and had a hamster named Leonardo in the past. Speaker A is considering getting a dog and already walks Speaker B's dog, Sparky. Speaker A enjoys running and listening to music as hobbies. Speaker A wants to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce. Speaker B is busy and appreciates the offer to help with Sparky. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try. Speaker B is also a high school student preparing for college, working at a diner at night.",
