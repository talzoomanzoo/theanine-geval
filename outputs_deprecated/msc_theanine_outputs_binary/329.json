It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume.\nSpeaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment. \nSpeaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think?\nSpeaker A: It depends on what you are trying to make out of origami, you can make some super complicated stuff, there's actually special paper that you can get for it! You may have seen origami be used in the hospital for some breathing aperatus!\nSpeaker B: That's amazing. I had no idea, but that totally makes sense. Do you have to practice a lot -- sort of a use it or lose it kind of thing?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys art and music, specifically painting.
