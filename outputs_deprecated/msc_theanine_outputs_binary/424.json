    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The memory provides facts about Speaker B's interests and background unrelated to the current topic of pet snakes, which is the focus of the dialogue context. There is no past information regarding Speaker B's experience or thoughts related to their pets, making the memory unhelpful for generating the next response based on the current dialogue topic.\nJudgement: \"No\""
