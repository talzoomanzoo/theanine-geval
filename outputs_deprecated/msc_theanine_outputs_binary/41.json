Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden?\nSpeaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends.\nSpeaker A: That sounds nice! So how is your job going?\nSpeaker B: Always interesting, that's for sure! I have been training to nurse on a new floor, so that'll give me a change of scenery.\nSpeaker A: Does that add a lot of extra work to your plate?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses, which causes Speaker A to consider visiting their cousin in Sweden and save money for the trip. Speaker B recommends checking out the volcanoes in Sweden for a unique experience, which they would like to do together. Speaker B grew up in Sweden and developed an interest in good coffee and chocolates, which was discussed with Speaker A.",

    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY indicates several pieces of information about Speaker B's connection with Sweden, including interests that could be relevant to the discussion, but none of this information is directly related to their job or how adding new responsibilities might impact their workload. The dialogue context primarily focuses on Speaker B's job and how it is adding interest and potentially extra work to their life. Therefore, the MEMORY does not provide relevant context or past information that could help generate an appropriate response to Speaker A's last question about Speaker B's workload.\nJudgement: \"No\""
