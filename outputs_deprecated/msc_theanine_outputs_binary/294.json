If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \nSpeaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with?\nSpeaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point.\nSpeaker A: Yes, it contains eggs.  I think you would do well with the fried rice. It's best to cook the rice the day before.  \nSpeaker B: I didn't know that. Why cook the rice beforehand? Is it better to age rice or something?\nSpeaker A: The rice needs to be cool before adding to the pan.  Are you able to take a passenger along in you truck?\nSpeaker B: Oh! That makes since. I didn't realize that the temperature made a difference when frying rice. As for the truck, Yes I can. But, depending on what company I'm working for at the time, they often set restrictions on passengers.\nSpeaker A: The rice tends to stick together if it's warm.  I would like to ride along with you sometime when you're able.\nSpeaker B: I actually have a scheduled haul for next Wednesday. Do you want to come along for that ride? It should take about five hours.\nSpeaker A: Sure, I'm free that day.  What time do I need to meet you?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, who lives in a rural area with a farm and can relate to cooking, causes Speaker A to be interested in running a business with their cooking skills. Speaker B, who is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker, also sparks Speaker A's interest in running a business with their cooking skills. \nSpeaker B, who does not cook but enjoys listening to country music and drives trucks for a living, also mentions having a farm with animals like chickens, ducks, pigs, goats, and growing crops like corn, strawberries, and pumpkins, which is a topic discussed by Speaker A who has 14 chickens and uses their eggs for baking.",
