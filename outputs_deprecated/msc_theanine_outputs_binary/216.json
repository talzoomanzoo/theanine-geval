I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field?\nSpeaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate?\nSpeaker B: I have another year- so this year is really important I get internships and start making connections in the field.   I love going to the beach too.  What happened with your knees that now cause you so much pain?\nSpeaker A: I think age has really been my knees downfall. I also used to hike a lot and I put a lot of pressure on my legs. That is great that you only have a year. Maybe when you graduate you can come hang out on the beach with me. I can't surf but I would love to watch you.\nSpeaker B: That would be fun!  I like collecting shells too so we could do that as well.  I have a small collection of ones I have from around the world.  The farthest away was from Greece.  Have you traveled a lot?\nSpeaker A: I have. I love Europe. I have been to many countries there but I have not gone to Greece yet. I would love to. The scenery and architecture is amazing. Have you gotten to visit other European countries?\nSpeaker B: I have.   I have also been to France and Ireland.  Where have you been in Europe?\nSpeaker A: Oh gosh. I have been to France, England, Ireland, Switzerland, Austria, Poland, Germany, Leichenstein, Spain, and much of Mexico, and Bermuda. I just love to travel but I have not been able to recently and with my knees I cannot sit in coach anymore and first class is so expensive. Do you plan on settling any place in particular once you graduate? \nSpeaker B: That's awesome you have been so many places!   I  am not sure where I will setlle down after graduation.  It probably will depend whether I decide to go further in my education or not and I have any residency requirements with that.   I do like the heat though so  hopefully somewhere sunny!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B's interest in sports medicine and surfing has changed from being solely focused on playing soccer with other students to seeking internships in the sports medicine field and collecting shells at the beach. Speaker A is providing advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field. \n\nSpeaker B's interest in sports medicine and surfing has been influenced by the fact that their mother runs a local high school, and Speaker B is her only child. This has led Speaker B to study sports medicine, play soccer, and aspire to join their college team in the future. \n\nSpeaker A's retirement has led them to enjoy hiking along the coast, collecting shells, and mentioning that their knees can't handle much else.",
