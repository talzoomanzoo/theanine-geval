Do you miss it?\nSpeaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \nSpeaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living.\nSpeaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime?\nSpeaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with.\nSpeaker A: Sounds great! Now the tough question: when do you have time?\nSpeaker B: It would have to be sometime when I'm off work, maybe on the weekend. \nSpeaker A: OK. Just let me know when you want to plan it and I will put in the reservation request. Do you need to borrow cleats or anything? I am a size 11.5.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket, but now plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week. Additionally, Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments. \nSpeaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United. \nSpeaker A enjoys playing soccer and is studying Humanities in college with the goal of finishing before looking for a job. They are seeking career advice from a guidance counselor and considering options in humanities or teaching.",

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks for offering! I might need to borrow some cleats, my old ones are probably too small now.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The memory provides information about Speaker A's background as a soccer player, which ties into the current discussion about playing soccer recreationally. Additionally, knowing that Speaker B played soccer in college is directly related to their interest in playing again. However, specific details like Speaker B's support for Manchester United or Speaker A's major do not contribute significantly to this specific dialogue context but are still somewhat relevant. Memory about the future job aspirations and college studies of Speaker A could inform future responses regarding scheduling and long-term planning for playing soccer.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
