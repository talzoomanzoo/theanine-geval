Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\nSpeaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it.\nSpeaker A: Cool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot. What is your favorite part about camping?\nSpeaker B: I love being out in the wilderness and sleeping under the stars in the fresh air. It makes you realize how beautiful life is and how small we really are in comparison to the universe.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B's involvement with the scout troop and work at a fast food place causes Speaker A to appreciate it and invite them to a youth retreat. This leads Speaker B, who has been in Boy Scouts for 7-8 years and is currently a Life Scout, to consider attending the retreat. On the other hand, Speaker A's church activities and mention of a church retreat prompt Speaker B, who is busy with scouts, school, work, and tennis, to be willing to take vacation days for the retreat. This also leads Speaker B to contemplate attending a local community college for the first couple of years.",
