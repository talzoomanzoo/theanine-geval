Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\nSpeaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it.\nSpeaker A: Cool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot.
