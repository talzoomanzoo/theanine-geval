Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know. \nSpeaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like.\nSpeaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too.\nSpeaker B: Nice! Is anyone coming with you?\nSpeaker A: Just my doggy Drunky.  You never know,  I might meet a nice lady out there. \nSpeaker B: Totally.  There will be a bunch of women there and it'll be easy to strike up conversations.  Just be confident and I'm sure you could walk away with a bunch of numbers.\nSpeaker A: Oh, I definitely will. Thanks for the motivation. Is this going to me your first festival?\nSpeaker B: No, I used to go to them all the time.  This will be my first one in a while and probably my last since my wife and I are about to have our baby.\nSpeaker A: You could make this one festival your \"escape\" every year. Don't give up the festivals, you need to have something to keep you happy.\n\nMEMORY:\n[Speaker A does not live in Mexico but likes Mexican food and women.] - (SameTopic) - [Speaker B's wife is pregnant and currently in the second trimester, still working.]  \n[Speaker B is a mechanic who enjoys working on cars.] - (React) - [Speaker B is not going out drinking much due to their wife's pregnancy.]  \n[Speaker A owns a Subaru Legacy and mentions having a baby on the way.] - (React) - [Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy.]",
