Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\nSpeaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise? \nSpeaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A, a recent high school graduate on a cross-country journey, is eager to visit the Columbia Trail and Ken Lockwood Gorge for a camping and hiking trip. Additionally, Speaker A applied for a job at a grocery store near a hiking trail. Speaker A also plans to leave a hammock by the river for fellow hikers to use at a hidden spot off the main hiking trail and suggests bringing water for the hike, mentioning a picnic at the mountain top.",

    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY provides additional information about Speaker A's interests in camping, hiking, and trails, which could align with Speaker B's interest in working with the park system. However, this information does not directly relate to the conversation about Speaker A's new job or Speaker B's current work situation. The MEMORY does not offer specific past dialogue mentioned in the CONTEXT that would inform or suggest a better response for Speaker A regarding the topic at hand.\n\nJudgement: No"
