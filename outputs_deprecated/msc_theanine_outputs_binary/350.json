Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar.\nSpeaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general?\nSpeaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts.\nSpeaker A: How's learning to bake going in general, especially now that you're off desserts?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A's strong connection to jello, especially cherry flavor, stems from their grandma making it at family dinners, leading to Speaker A learning various jello recipes from their grandmother.\n2. Speaker A's favorite jello eating habit transformed into a family tradition after learning how to make jello from their grandma, suggesting Speaker B to involve their grandmother in learning jello recipes.\n3. Speaker A's upbringing by two non-meat eater moms shifted into a family tradition of learning jello recipes from their grandma.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY provides background about Speaker A's connection to jello due to their grandmother, but it does not contain directly relevant information that could aid Speaker B in responding to the question about how learning to bake is going without desserts. The MEMORY focuses more on Speaker A's jello experiences rather than any aspects of baking or dealing with cutting back on desserts.\nJudgement: \"No\""
