Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\nSpeaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient! \nSpeaker A: Wow, that gives me a completely different perspective. You'd really be ok with seeing me? You don't think it would be a conflict of interest since we're friends?\nSpeaker B: No not at all but if you didn't feel comfortable talking to me I can recommend a couple of my colleagues who are just as brilliant\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a passion for horse breeding and taking care of horses, working at a stable and enjoying being around them.\nSpeaker B, living in the city, is interested in having a horse in the future and considers the psychological aspects of owning one, relating it to Freudian theories.\nSpeaker B's profession as a therapist is influenced by their mom being a busy nurse, causing them to discuss the challenges and rewards of being a therapist and the restrictions on relationships with clients.\nSpeaker B, a therapist and a football fan supporting the Chiefs, reflects on the profession's ups and downs, while Speaker A mentions the potential medical costs of horses hurting themselves during exercise.",
