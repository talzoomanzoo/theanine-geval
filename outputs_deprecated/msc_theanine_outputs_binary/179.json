Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know. \nSpeaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like.\nSpeaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too.\nSpeaker B: Nice! Is anyone coming with you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys Mexican food and drinks, and plays music for fun. This leads Speaker A to frequent live band venues and play music at home. Additionally, Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy bluegrass music.\n\n2. Speaker A owns a Subaru Legacy and mentions having a baby on the way, causing Speaker B's wife to be pregnant and currently in the second trimester while still working. Speaker B's wife being pregnant makes them want to consider attending a local festival for just a day. In the same vein, Speaker A is unsure if they will ever settle down with a partner and have kids.\n\n3. Speaker A enjoying Mexican food and drinks, and playing music for fun, causes Speaker B to feel a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy. This leads to Speaker A and Speaker B discussing the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.",
