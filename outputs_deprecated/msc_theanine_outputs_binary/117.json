    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY contains some information relevant to the dialogue, such as Speaker A working at a restaurant and getting free meals. However, the specific details of the memory—like the fire incident or inviting Speaker B to visit—are not relevant to the current context about the chicken parmesan, tres leches, or dessert preferences. Since the information provided doesn't add any insight or context that directly relates to the ongoing discussion, it is not helpful.\nJudgement: No"
