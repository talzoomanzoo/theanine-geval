Thank you for the recommendation.\nSpeaker B: Of course. I recommend that movie to everyone I meet. I think I've watched it over one hundred times. So what is the next movie on your list to watch soon?\nSpeaker A: Yeah it was great and I will also recommend to people when they ask what movie is good. So next is another one you recommended which is coming to America. What’s the next movie your going to watch? \nSpeaker B: There is a horror genre movie that was released just this week which I'm going to watch tonight. It is called \"Girl Next.\"\nSpeaker A: Oh that sounds interesting, I will look into that and put it on my list. How has your job been going? Is there where you get all these great ideas for what to watch?  \nSpeaker B: My Film Studies professor job has been going absolutely great lately. I love all my students, because they really get into the lectures and ask lots of questions. Yes, my job requires me to watch movies all the time, so that is how I find the best ones. Is your programmer job going all right lately?\nSpeaker A: That sounds amazing. Super lucky to have students that really enjoy what they are learning about and I’m sure that’s down to the way you teach and what you teach them. I’m so glad it is all going well for you. Yeah it is going much better now, I’m really getting in the swing of things thank you for asking. \nSpeaker B: You're welcome. So, returning to the subject of Pulp Fiction, did you think it was funny? Did you think it was too violent for kids to watch?\nSpeaker A: Yeah there was some funny parts in that movie. I kinda think it may be a little to violent for kids, but I would just allow it to each parent to decide I would probably let my grandkids watch. What is your opinion? \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys programming and plans to go for a long run after work. Speaker B enjoys watching suspense films, action, SF, horror, westerns, drama, and occasional good comedy. Speaker A is interested in watching movies, mentioned Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman.

    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information such as Speaker B's extensive movie knowledge and their past experience in teaching Film Studies. This information is helpful because it supports Speaker B's credibility in offering movie-related opinions, particularly about the age appropriateness of a film, which is a topic being discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \nJudgement: Yes"
