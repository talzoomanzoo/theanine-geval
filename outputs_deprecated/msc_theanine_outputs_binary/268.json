It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \nSpeaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on?\nSpeaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is excelling in the sports medicine class, causing Speaker A to struggle with maintaining good grades and only excel in gym.\nSpeaker B and Speaker A both find history class boring and overwhelming, with Speaker B eager to finish school to escape their mother's strictness.\nSpeaker B is pressured to maintain straight A's in sports medicine to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.",
