    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The dialogue context revolves around Speaker B's recent trip and mentions their daughter's enjoyment of it, transitioning to a question about camping. Memory 1 discusses the zoo and has no relation to camping, but Memory 2 is relevant as it involves Speaker B's concerns about leaving a kitten during camping trips, which could inform Speaker A's response about camping-related childcare tips.\nJudgement: Yes"
