My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to?\nSpeaker A: I recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca. It was super cute and made me want to go visit Italy, but that was too expensive, so instead I booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month. What about you?\nSpeaker B: I have been relaxing with the kids as much as I have. My husband has been busy with work, so we haven't had time for anything big. I would love to visit Italy some day though if we get the chance. Have you ever been to Italy before?\nSpeaker A: I have never gone to Italy because I'm always so busy. If I ever go, I would want to spend a month there, but work has been hectic lately. Would your kids go with you if you went to Italy?\nSpeaker B: Absolutely! I'd love to travel all over the world with my family to see everything. Hawaii sounds like just as much fun though. What are you most excited about doing when you get there?\nSpeaker A: I'm extremely excited about the sunset tour. Each day is at a new location to watch the sunset. It's suppose to be romantic, but I am just going alone, so I see it as more calming than anything.\nSpeaker B: I hope you have a lot fun. It sounds like a nice time to get away from everything. You should eat as much of the local Hawaiian food as you can. Have you had Hawaiian food before? I think it's great.\nSpeaker A: No, I acctually haven't. I'm expecting pineapple and ham on everything, but I know they will having some amazing cultural food that is probably going to blow my mind! Is there a specific dish you would recommend\nSpeaker B: I enjoy foods like Spam musubi, loco mocos, and poi. My favorite might be kalua pork. The way they prepare the pig makes it taste so good.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A prefers watching the sunset over movies - (SameTopic) - Speaker B's kids enjoy watching Disney movies, which Speaker B also finds good - (React) - Speaker A has seen the Disney movie 'Luca' recently.\nSpeaker A prefers watching the sunset over movies - (SameTopic) - Speaker B's kids enjoy watching Disney movies, which Speaker B also finds good - (React) - Speaker B's kids enjoyed watching 'Luca' and said it was good.\nSpeaker A and Speaker B have a light-hearted conversation - (SameTopic) - Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy sunsets and movies, with Speaker A preferring the beach for watching sunsets - (Want) - Speaker A has booked a \"Hawaii Sunset\" tour for next month, being excited about it being their first time.",
