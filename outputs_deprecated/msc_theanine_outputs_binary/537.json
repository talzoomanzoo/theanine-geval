He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies!\nSpeaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?  \nSpeaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere!\nSpeaker B: You have a point.  It is nice to see puppies wagging their tail and just following you!  Changing topics, do you have any recipes with asparagus?  You know, it's such a popular vegetable, but I just don't know how to prepare it.\nSpeaker A: I don't have recipes but I know how to make a good grilled asparagus. Are you looking to bolster your chef book?\nSpeaker B: I sure am!  Grilled asparagus does sound good.  Do you pair the grilled asparagus with your fajitas?  What do you prefer, chicken or beef fajitas?\nSpeaker A: I prefer chicken to beef. I pair it with beef fajitas andI think it's great to have with a glass of merlot. Do you like wine?\nSpeaker B: You're making me hungry!  Yes, I do love wine.  As a matter of fact, I used to live in the Bordeaux region in France, so my favorite wine is Bordeaux wine.  But I also love champagne and cognac.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys cooking, especially making fajitas, and also volunteers at animal shelters. Speaker B is interested in trying different careers and is considering becoming a chef for Speaker A who loves Mexican food and seafood. Speaker B is working on a project to build their resume and is unsure about the type of work they want to do.",
