If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \nSpeaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with?\nSpeaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point.\nSpeaker A: Yes, it contains eggs.  I think you would do well with the fried rice. It's best to cook the rice the day before.  \nSpeaker B: I didn't know that. Why cook the rice beforehand? Is it better to age rice or something?\nSpeaker A: The rice needs to be cool before adding to the pan.  Are you able to take a passenger along in you truck?\nSpeaker B: Oh! That makes since. I didn't realize that the temperature made a difference when frying rice. As for the truck, Yes I can. But, depending on what company I'm working for at the time, they often set restrictions on passengers.\nSpeaker A: The rice tends to stick together if it's warm.  I would like to ride along with you sometime when you're able.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, who does not cook but enjoys listening to country music and drives trucks for a living, has a husband who is a great cook. Speaker B is not skilled in cooking, but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker. \nSpeaker B, who does not cook but enjoys listening to country music and drives trucks for a living, also mentions having a farm with animals like chickens, ducks, pigs, goats, and growing crops like corn, strawberries, and pumpkins. Speaker A, who owns a farm and enjoys cooking and baking, is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken. \nSpeaker B, who lives in a rural area with a farm and can relate to cooking, reacts to Speaker A who bakes muffins and bread but is conscious of their impact on their weight. Speaker A is interested in running a business with their cooking skills and recommends the pressure cooker for its efficiency and ease of use, suggesting it to Speaker B.",
