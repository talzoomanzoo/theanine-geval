Can you tell me about it?\nSpeaker B: Yes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see. \nSpeaker A: I definitely will, this sounds like such an amazing trip. How long has it been since you've been there yourself?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A's mother being a pediatrician causes Speaker A to have kids and be familiar with Greek mythology, which in turn causes Speaker B to plan a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five. \nSpeaker B having three kids makes Speaker A have kids and be familiar with Greek mythology, leading Speaker B and their kids to be excited about their upcoming trip to Greece. \nSpeaker B being excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loving Athena, whom they consider a perfect goddess for a librarian, is the same topic as Speaker B's enjoyment of being outside and reading Star Wars novels, which in turn makes Speaker B plan a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five.",

This indirectly suggests that Speaker B has not been to Athens recently, which is relevant to the question asked by Speaker A about when Speaker B last visited the Acropolis.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
