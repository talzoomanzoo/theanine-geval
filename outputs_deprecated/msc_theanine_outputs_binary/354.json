    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY provides information about Speaker B's interest in water skiing, which is relevant to the conversation about water skiing. However, the MEMORY primarily focuses on Speaker B's general interests in snowboarding and music, which are not directly related to this specific dialogue context. Therefore, while it contains minor helpful information, it is not crucial for generating a proper response in this conversation.\nJudgement: No"
