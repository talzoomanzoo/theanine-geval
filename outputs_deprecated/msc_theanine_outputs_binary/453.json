    "prediction": "OUTPUT\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information about Speaker A's and Speaker B's mutual interest in barbecuing, which aligns with Speaker A's mention of meeting for a barbecue in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, Speaker B's preference for grilling steaks and barbecuing could influence the choice of responses surrounding the conversation about their get-together. Therefore, the MEMORY provides helpful context for Speaker B to generate a well-informed response.\n\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
