Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden?\nSpeaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends.\nSpeaker A: That sounds nice! So how is your job going?\nSpeaker B: Always interesting, that's for sure! I have been training to nurse on a new floor, so that'll give me a change of scenery.\nSpeaker A: Does that add a lot of extra work to your plate?\nSpeaker B: At the moment, yes. I'll be in Pediatrics, which has always been my passion. It's a completely different environment than the ER.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a cousin in Sweden and has not visited the country, but wants to travel there with Speaker B. \nSpeaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip, so they are thinking about taking a second part-time job. \nSpeaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to high expenses, but plans to travel there with Speaker A.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY contains information that Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden and is planning a trip there, which is also mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, MEMORY implies that Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel together, which conflicts with their separate plans in the conversation. The part about saving money for the trip by taking a second job does not relate to the current context of discussing trips, job changes, and aspirations without financial details. Thus, the MEMORY does not contribute meaningful or relevant new insights that would aid Speaker A in generating a response in the current context.\nJudgement: No"
