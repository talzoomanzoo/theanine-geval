Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her?\nSpeaker B: Hi there, hope you are wlll and managing to save up for your Italy trip?  Thank for asking about the Greek mythology study, we are doing very well. It helps because i am so passionate about it and hope to get to the Greek islands soon\nSpeaker A: Yes I have been saving up for another trip to Italy! I can't wait. It's planned for next Spring. Do you have any plans to go back to Italy in the future?\nSpeaker B: I would love to get back to Italy but need to save up and the hopeful priority is to Greece this year.  You have friends in Europe are you in contact to see what plans you can make?\nSpeaker A: Yes I've been talking to them quite a bit so they know what's going on. I'll be staying with some of them while I'm over there. I have never been to Greece....I'd like to go though. Maybe I'll add it to my itinerary! Maybe we could plan to be in Greece at the same time?!\nSpeaker B: That would be so good.  There is so much history and the roman statues i take my daughter to see in the museums and through our local resources is fab.  She is building up the passion which is lovely to see.  Have you still got your hair blue or has it grown out now?\nSpeaker A: That's awesome! Maybe you can teach me a little about all the mythology. I think I've never liked it before only because I didn't understand it. My hair is back to being its natural brown - lol I'm being boring for the moment.\nSpeaker B: Never boring you will keep styling it all sorts of interesting styles im sure.  Yes i would be lovely to be your guide for the day out in Greece.  Bring some decent walking boots and some sun cream, its a different heat out there but your tan is probably topped up with going to the beach each day.\nSpeaker A: That's good advice! Thank you! I saw on the news Cali has been getting a lot of rain. Have you still been able to run on the beach each day?\nSpeaker B: I've got very wet most days unfortunately but need to keep up with the exercise.  Been taking to the gym to keep dry.  When im not out in the surf of a morning first thing on the weekends, to avoid the crowds as you know im not too good at the surfing but its good fun. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is planning for a spring break trip and recently bought a dress for Easter.
