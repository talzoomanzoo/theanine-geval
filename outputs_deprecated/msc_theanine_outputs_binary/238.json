Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \nSpeaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along!\nSpeaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them.\nSpeaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me!\nSpeaker A: Hahaha. Yes I agree its too hot to get a long hike in. I've been on some short ones, but the bugs eat me alive. I like to hike in the fall when the bugs are dying off and its a little cooler.\nSpeaker B: Ah yes, that's my favorite time of year. Oh and speaking of Tasha, I'm still amazed she knows Mandarin. Have you been learning more of the language?\nSpeaker A: I've been learning a little more. I try to learn a few things a day. Tasha's reactions to my talking to myself in Mandarin is funny, she looks confused most of the time.\nSpeaker B: That is funny. And impressive that you're learning. The closest I can get to another language is doing a bad New York accent LOL\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B loves animals, lives in the city they grew up in, and has a cat that recently had a kitten. This led Speaker B to have two sick kitties and recently receive a rescue. Speaker A, on the other hand, has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n\nSpeaker A, a country girl who loves animals and is a lacto-ovo vegetarian, now has a pet named Tasha who speaks Mandarin. As a result, Speaker A has been learning Mandarin, and Tasha has started saying Chinese phrases instead of English ones. This has led Speaker A to be interested in adopting a rescue kitten, similar to Speaker B.",
