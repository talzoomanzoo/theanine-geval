It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \nSpeaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on?\nSpeaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study?\nSpeaker B: Ah, English should be easier than History. Sure, I can help you. What do you need to do exactly? Write an essay?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is studying sports medicine in college, while Speaker A hopes to improve their grades and aims for a soccer scholarship. Speaker A excels only in gym class despite struggling with maintaining good grades. \nSpeaker B and Speaker A both discuss their challenges in school, with Speaker A finding history boring and Speaker B feeling overwhelmed by their strict mother. \nSpeaker B, who plays soccer and has no siblings, shares the same goal as Speaker A in wanting to improve grades and aiming for a soccer scholarship. Speaker A excels only in gym class despite their academic struggles.",
