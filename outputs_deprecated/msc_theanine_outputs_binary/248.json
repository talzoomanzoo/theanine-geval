I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me.\nSpeaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway?\nSpeaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day! I'll make it as fun as possible.\nSpeaker B: I will someday. just not in the summer when all the bugs are out! Where do you go hiking the most?\nSpeaker A: I like to go hiking in the local trails here. I am familiar with them and there's so many routes that I can take. Sadly, the bugs are as bad here as they are anywhere else.....\nSpeaker B: They can't be that bad in the fall right? I hope? Do you camp most every weekend?\nSpeaker A: A least a couple of times a month. Sometimes, yeah, I go every weekend to relax. Being in nature is so relaxing to me. And nah the bugs aren't too bad in the fall and winter. There's a beautiful river along one trail that I bet you'd love to see. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys camping and hiking as free activities, which includes leading hikes for the group they camp with, usually lasting an hour or two. This is a change from their upcoming Appalachian Trail hike, which will last for 10 days. Additionally, Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer, including a part of the Appalachian Trail.",
