    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory contains information related to Speaker A's regular visits to the zoo and interests in specific animals like tigers and monkeys. Since the conversation in the dialogue context is about a zoo visit and potentially meeting someone named Joshua at the zoo, the memory about zoo visits is relevant and could be helpful in shaping Speaker A's response.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
