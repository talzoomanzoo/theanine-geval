It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to?\nSpeaker A: The museum has all sorts of galleries.  It has a sculpture garden outside.  I mostly like the impressionist paintings.  I like Van Gogh.  Was your concert outdoors?\nSpeaker B: Yes. That way they could have a fireworks show too. I love fireworks. Have you ever seen the fireworks at the Disney castle?\nSpeaker A: No, but I have been to Disney World in Florida.  I love fireworks too.  I want to get married on the 4th of July.  That was we will have a national holiday and fireworks for us every year!  It sounds like you've been to Disneyland?\nSpeaker B: No, but I thought you might have since you lived in LA for awhile. Did you get to see any live Disney music performances while you were at Disney World?\nSpeaker A: No, we rode a lot of rides that broke down.  We had to be rescued from the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.  It was stuck.  Someone put on waders and pushed us to the side to climb out.\nSpeaker B: Oh no! Hopefully your trip to the art museum is much better than that. Did your boyfriend go to Disney World too?\nSpeaker A: No, I had a cousin that I went with.  We stayed in a hotel in Miami too and I got so sunburned on the beach!  I'm sure the art museum will be good if it isn't too crowded.  Was your concert crowded?\nSpeaker B: It was so crowded, but my older brothers went with me and kept me from getting squished. Make sure you wear sunscreen when you visit the beach this time!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys going to museums and trying different foods. They plan to do lots of shopping during their trip.\nSpeaker B is waiting for bands to announce their summer tour schedule to plan which shows to attend.",

    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY mentions both speakers' interests which tangentially relate to topics in the current conversation. Speaker A's interest in museums and planning to shop aligns with part of the context where they discuss visiting a museum. However, these interests do not provide new or specific insight to directly inform Speaker A's next response. Speaker B's interest in bands and tours is not relevant to the current topic of fireworks and theme parks. Overall, the MEMORY provides general background but lacks specific connection to aid in continuing the conversation.\n\nJudgement: No"
