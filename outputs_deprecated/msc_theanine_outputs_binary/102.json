My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do.\nSpeaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars.\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I think they go dark for a couple months and then have daylight for a couple months! I actually like night time, but having daylight all the time will make me crazy lol. Yeah I kind of hope it's dark for the camping but it will be very cold. I have heard Alaska has delicious ice cream. I want to try that while I'm there, \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B share a sense of humor and make each other laugh during the conversation.
