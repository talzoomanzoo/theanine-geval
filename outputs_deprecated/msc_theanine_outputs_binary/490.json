Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\nSpeaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise? \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs. Speaker A plans to potentially visit the Columbia Trail and Ken Lockwood Gorge for a camping and hiking trip. Speaker A and Speaker B have gone hiking together before and plan to meet up for another hike. Speaker B is not in the best hiking shape and jokes about needing to recharge their energy.",

    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY provided contains information about Speaker A's background, hobbies, and a shared interest with Speaker B, specifically hiking. However, the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT centers around Speaker A's new job opportunity and Speaker B's side job situation, focusing more on career paths. The MEMORY does not provide any relevant information or past interactions related to career interests or ‘career-wise’ aspirations that would help Speaker B formulate a response to Speaker A's question about career goals.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
