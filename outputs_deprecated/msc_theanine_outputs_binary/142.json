Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\nSpeaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach?\nSpeaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option.\nSpeaker A: Yes I think history is interesting, too! Both of those subjects would be great because there are probably lots of teaching jobs. What kind of history do you like?\nSpeaker B: I love all sorts of history. Right now I am really getting into the weeds of World War II. There's so much to unpack.\nSpeaker A: For sure! So much happened and it really affected how the world is today. I like learning about the history of places where I have lived, it's really interesting.\nSpeaker B: That sounds really cool! What have you learned about where you currently live?\nSpeaker A: Oh, I found out that the big sports field used to be a farm where they grew wheat and raised cows! It's really cool to see places in old photos and see how they have changed.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. Speaker B mentions feeling limited in job opportunities and is studying linguistics. Speaker A is studying computer science and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth, as well as being interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.",

    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY mentions Speaker B's interest in becoming a college professor in linguistics and feeling limited in job opportunities. Given the DIALOGUE CONTEXT discussing Speaker B's interest in teaching English or history, this information about pursuing higher education and a career in academia is relevant. It indicates a deeper consideration for teaching as a career, which aligns with the ongoing conversation about teaching subjects.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
