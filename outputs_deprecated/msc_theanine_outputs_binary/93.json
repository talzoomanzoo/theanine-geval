How are the little furries doing?\nSpeaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from?\nSpeaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there.\nSpeaker B: That's great. I have gotten my pets from the shelter and they seem happy I brought them home. I have a hard time saying no to them which is why I have so many pets. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs. Do you have a name in mind for your cat? \nSpeaker A: I've thought of a lot of  names, but in the end it will probably depend on the breed and the sex.  \nSpeaker B: That's true. Is pilates hard? I've always wanted to try it but I don't know if it will be too difficult.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B's prices for a portrait start at $5000 to pay for college tuition. Speaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals and discovered a love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets. Speaker B thinks pit bulls are lovely and has one that is kind and sweet. Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions.\n\nSpeaker A has a brother and might commission a family portrait from Speaker B. Both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy the company of their pets and think they are smart and playful. Speaker B has 5 dogs of different breeds and has rats as pets but didn't include them in the portrait. Speaker B thinks pit bulls are lovely and has one that is kind and sweet.\n\nSpeaker A has a brother and might commission a family portrait from Speaker B.
