We're going with Pumpkin!\nSpeaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name? \nSpeaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls! \nSpeaker B: I see what you meant. Plus the color is beautiful orange. I want to see them together, even I am not a cat person they must be cute together at that time. Once the kitten grows up, situation gonna change to me. How are they, they are doing well?\nSpeaker A: Marmalade is orange too but this is better because the baby is sassy and climbs up my leg to sit on my shoulder. I don't understand how you are not a cat person when you have such a large heart for stray kittens.\nSpeaker B: hehe you're right. But i can't explain that why I am not a cat person to you sorry. How's the weather like today, still good weather to have iced tea out there?\nSpeaker A: It's beautiful. I'm sitting outside while the Spice Girls are chasing bugs in the grass. What did your kids name your cats?\nSpeaker B: ohh so nice sounds like you are enjoying the weather. Still we are discussing about that. Did not name them yet. Also I want to put them back since I am not a big fan of cat\nSpeaker A: That would be cruel to do. You need to rehome them properly or otherwise someone may report you to the authorities for animal abuse. My heart is breaking for your poor cats. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys taking their kitten on trips and has a Subaru. Speaker B, who loves dogs, ends up taking care of stray cats brought home by kids even though they are not a cat person.",
