It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \nSpeaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on?\nSpeaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study?\nSpeaker B: Ah, English should be easier than History. Sure, I can help you. What do you need to do exactly? Write an essay?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, we have to write an essay and we have a spelling component towards the end of the exam, I sure could use a little help!\nSpeaker B: No problem! I like correcting and editing essays. Although, it seems like your English is pretty good. I doubt you even need much help.\nSpeaker A: Excellent, thank you for taking the time to help me out a little. I would like to get an A!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B studying sports medicine in college has been getting all A's in the class, causing Speaker A to struggle to maintain good grades and excel only in gym. Speaker A, hopeful for a soccer scholarship, wishes to improve their grades. Speaker B feels pressured to maintain straight A's in sports medicine to avoid embarrassing their mother, who runs the school.",

While this could provide context for Speaker B's own academic perspective, it does not directly pertain to the immediate concerns or topics discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which revolves around Speaker A's exams and need for assistance in English. Therefore, this MEMORY does not provide information that is directly helpful for Speaker B's next response.\nJudgement: \"No\""
