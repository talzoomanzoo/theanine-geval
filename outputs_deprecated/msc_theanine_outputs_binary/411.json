Did you find the book sufficiently exciting? \nSpeaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far.\nSpeaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes. \nSpeaker A: why don't you like books like that?\nSpeaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading?\nSpeaker A: Not yet.  I think Netflix is going to make it into a movie soon.  They might finally convince me to pay for a subscription haha.\nSpeaker B: Well if it's any good I know you'll be watching the whole thing.\nSpeaker A: you know it.  And I know that you would just fall asleep during it whether it's any good or not.\nSpeaker B: Is there a lot of violence in your book? I couldn't stand to read it if there was. \nSpeaker A: There's a little bit.  Mostly just when describing how the crimes occurred though.  There are also some fight scenes between the cops and the criminals.  It's not too bad.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys reading books about animals. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n2. Speaker B has a son and enjoys reading books about animals. Speaker B is looking forward to having more time to themselves once their son starts preschool next year. Speaker B wants to volunteer at an animal shelter when her son starts school.\n3. Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix. Speaker B is a mother to a son who is going to start going to school soon, which causes Speaker B to plan to buy school supplies and check local stores or order online.",
