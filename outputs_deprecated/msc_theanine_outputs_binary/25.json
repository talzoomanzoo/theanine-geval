That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience. Speaker A offers to take Sparky for a walk to help out and spend time with the dog. Speaker A is considering getting a dog and already walks Speaker B's dog, Sparky. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.",

    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY indicates that Speaker B works in a research lab on weekends, which aligns with the current discussion about working in a lab to clone a cow. This shows Speaker B's commitment to and interest in lab work, possibly making the MEMORY relevant. However, the specific details about neuroscience and other personal aspects like the dog and the casserole are not directly linked to the discussion about cloned cows or cloned meat alternatives.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
