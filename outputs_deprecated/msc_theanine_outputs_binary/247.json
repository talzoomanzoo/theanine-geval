I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me.\nSpeaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway?\nSpeaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day!

Sadly, the bugs are as bad here as they are anywhere else.....\nSpeaker B: They can't be that bad in the fall right? I hope? Do you camp most every weekend?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks, which has led to them planning several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail. They also lead hikes for the group they camp with, which are usually an hour or two long, but Speaker A is now nervous about the Appalachian Trail hike, as they don't usually do full day hikes. Additionally, Speaker A is a personal trainer who loves camping in remote areas and is comfortable around animals in the woods, although they admit a bear would make them jumpy.",
