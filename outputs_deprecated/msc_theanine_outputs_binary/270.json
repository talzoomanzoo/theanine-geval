It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B.

I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \nSpeaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on?\nSpeaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study?\nSpeaker B: Ah, English should be easier than History. Sure, I can help you. What do you need to do exactly?

Speaker B feels overwhelmed by their mother's strictness and looks forward to finishing school to escape it.\nSpeaker A believes that sports demonstrate how everyone can work together equally.
