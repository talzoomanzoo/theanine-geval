    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY contains some useful information about Speaker B, particularly that they used to teach Film Studies and carefully choose which movies to watch. This is relevant because Speaker B has been discussing movies in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, and it helps explain their keen interest and extensive knowledge about films. However, the MEMORY also contains irrelevant information, such as Speaker B having a sister who shares an opinion about age with Speaker A, which doesn't directly help in generating the next response in this specific context.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
