    "raw_prediction": "I'm hoping to visit Sweden again soon, maybe this summer. I miss playing tennis and going to church on Sundays there.",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information, such as Speaker A having a cousin in Sweden, which is currently part of the planning conversation. It also mentions that Speaker B is from Sweden, which could be useful for further conversation about familiarity with the country, but there is no detail in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT specifying that Speaker B is from Sweden. However, Speaker B did recommend seeing castles, hinting at personal familiarity. The MEMORY mentioning both speakers' enjoyment of exploring local music and coffee shops, although relevant to potential travel activities, isn't directly related to the current context of the trip planning and attractions discussion. Moreover, the MEMORY's mention of possibly traveling together isn't reflected in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\nJudgment: No"
