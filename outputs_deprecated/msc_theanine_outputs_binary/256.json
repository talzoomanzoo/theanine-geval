Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\nSpeaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\nSpeaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\nSpeaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.\nSpeaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe?\nSpeaker B: There is some weird chemical mix that I really do not mess with.  It is easy to clean up.  I try to stay away from this part of the movies.  I know what it should look like and that we want to keep everyone safe when using the fake blood.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B's father's involvement in producing horror movies influenced Speaker B's favorite genre, leading them to create horror movies with their dad and come up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\nSpeaker B's government job led them to mention taking a nap during work, while Speaker A's passion for producing horror movies makes them want to create movies with Speaker B.",
