What do you think?\nSpeaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons\nSpeaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use.\nSpeaker B: I am a little scared of needles though. Were your tattoos painful?\nSpeaker A: Most of them were not.  It really depends on where on your body you get them.  Most of mine are on areas that didn't hurt.  The one on my foot and the one behind my ear did hurt a good bit.  Where were you thinking about getting it?\nSpeaker B: I hadn't really thought about it! Maybe upper arm or upper back? But I'm no tattoo expert. And I'd have to get permission from my wife first, LOL\nSpeaker A: Definitely talk to her first.  I had a friend that didn't talk to his wife and just came home with a tattoo one day.  It led to a huge fight - both about the money he spent and not discussing it with her.  He slept on my couch for over a week!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father. This is why Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest. \nSpeaker A's favorite tattoo is the one dedicated to their late father, saying \"for you I shall live\". Therefore, Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.",
