It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip? \nSpeaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery\nSpeaker B: Yes I think that's a great idea, how is work at the library? \nSpeaker A: Busy, and demanding because we are short staffed. While there seems to be little need for a library these days, I find that we have less staff to get everything done\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has a lot of kids, all grown up now and with kids of their own, which is why Speaker B mentions having grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park. This causes Speaker B to like the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature. \n\nSpeaker A is a librarian and loves kids, mentioning having 3 children. As a result, Speaker A is busy with work and unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. This also leads to Speaker A's other children being addicted to tablets and phones, unlike the youngest one who is interested in music.",
