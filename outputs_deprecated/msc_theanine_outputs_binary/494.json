Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\nSpeaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise? \nSpeaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows.\nSpeaker A: That sounds wonderful! You'd get to just be out in nature all day. Sounds like a great job, especially if you're a bit introverted like me. That's why hiking is my favorite -- a good solitary activity. \nSpeaker B: Yes, I agree. What kind of hours would this new job have?\nSpeaker A: It's third shift, which isn't the greatest, but it pays a bit more than the other shifts, and I think I'll like getting off early in the morning. Then I can just go down and get in my hammock and have a nice relaxing moment after work. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is looking for a job and new camping gear, specifically a hammock, and plans to leave a hammock by the river for anyone to use at a hidden spot off the main hiking trail. There is a lake at the hiking trail, and Speaker A suggests swimming in it, warning that the water may be cold. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking, mentioning setting up a hammock at their campsite, and has gone hiking with Speaker B before and plans to meet up for another hike. Speaker B is not in the best hiking shape and jokes about needing to recharge their energy.",

    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY contains information about Speaker A's and Speaker B's mutual interest in hiking and camping, as well as Speaker A's plans involving a hammock, which relate to the current conversation about enjoying nature and hiking. However, this is not directly relevant to questions about Speaker A's new job's working hours or Speaker B's career aspirations in the conversation, so it does not provide additional helpful context for the immediate next response.\nJudgement: No"
