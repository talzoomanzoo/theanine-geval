What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs!\nSpeaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours?\nSpeaker A: Ikea! Their furniture is not to expensive and they have all kinds of furniture that'll go with whatever scheme you're going for. What kind of patio furniture were you looking for? Like a barbeque, chairs, hammock? \nSpeaker B: I guess I was going to get like an umbrella table and some chairs to go with it or maybe even a screened in gazebo with a fire pit in the middle.\nSpeaker A: That's a great idea! Sounds like a very nice place for a barbeque. What were you planning on grilling for the barbeque? \nSpeaker B: I'll get the steaks to grill if you will bring the corn. And I have a request for you to play on the guitar, I know you are into country so if you could maybe play a song or two by Miranda Lambert, that would be awesome.\nSpeaker A: Of course! I love Miranda Lambert, any specific song requests? \nSpeaker B: Nothing specific I love all her songs, I think I'm going get off here so I can try to order that gazebo.\nSpeaker A: Good luck finding a gazebo!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B are both discussing furniture and home decor choices, which leads to them planning to meet up to discuss the furniture exchange. This results in Speaker A inviting Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.",
