I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week?\nSpeaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day\nSpeaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through\nSpeaker A: Actually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to it. Do you think I will need to rent a car when I'm there, or is it possible to walk and bike in the summer? I always picture huge amounts of snow but I'm not sure if it's like that all year round.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A invited Speaker B to visit and mentioned looking into flights, causing Speaker A to plan to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit.\n\nSpeaker A invited Speaker B to visit and mentioned looking into flights, causing Speaker B to plan to visit Speaker A and be interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n\nSpeaker B is interested in visiting Alaska and mentions getting blackout curtains due to the midnight sun, causing Speaker B to find flights that work for their schedule and price and will be visiting Speaker A in a couple of weeks, which in turn causes Speaker A to be excited about the trip.",
