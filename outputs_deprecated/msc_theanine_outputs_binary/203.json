Do you miss it?\nSpeaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \nSpeaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living.\nSpeaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime?\nSpeaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket but now plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United. \nSpeaker A enjoys playing soccer and joked about treating Speaker B to lunch, indicating Speaker B is currently low on cash. Speaker B is considering asking for a raise at work and works as a clerk for a law firm, enjoying the work but wishing it paid better.",

This information would be helpful to develop the context or suggest activities related to soccer and maintain the flow of the conversation about soccer games, playing, and commentary. It aligns with Speaker A's interest in becoming a voice in soccer video games and Speaker B's suggestion to get back to playing.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
