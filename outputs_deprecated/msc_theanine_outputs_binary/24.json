That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is a high school student planning to go to college, achieving straight A's. Speaker A wants Speaker B to continue working in the lab and school instead of giving up their night job. Speaker B is also a high school student preparing for college, working at a diner at night. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.",

This helps in understanding the broader context of their goals, which could influence Speaker B's response regarding not quitting and considering the future of cloned beef consumption.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
