They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok? \nSpeaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish?\nSpeaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus!\nSpeaker B: Oh that sounds absolutely fabulous. Are you going to get a free dessert, as well?\nSpeaker A: Yes, I am thinking about trying either the new eclairs, or their tres leches cake with fresh raspberry jam sauce and lemon drizzle! I have too many good options to pick from! What one would you pick?\nSpeaker B: Hands down, I would pick the tres leches. Ever since I tried it a few years ago, it has always been my favorite dessert.\nSpeaker A: Okay, I will try that! I've heard the can be made with different fruits. Did you have fruit with yours?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule. This is because Speaker A works at a restaurant and enjoys the interaction with people at work and the variety of experiences that come with it. Additionally, Speaker A gets two free meals per week at the restaurant, along with taking home leftover baked goods.",

    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY provides additional information about Speaker A's work environment at the restaurant, which may help to build a richer context for Speaker B's replies. However, in this specific dialogue context where the conversation is centered around food choices and desserts, the MEMORY doesn't directly influence or alter what Speaker B has already stated or might state about the tres leches being their favorite. Instead, the MEMORY would be more relevant if the conversation was about meal benefits or Speaker A's experiences at work generally.\nJudgement: \"No\""
