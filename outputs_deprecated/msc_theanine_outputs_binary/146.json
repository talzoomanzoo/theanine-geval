    "raw_prediction": "I usually camp in a tent, but I've been thinking about trying out a camper trailer for more comfort. How about you?",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY contains information about Speaker B's concern for their pets when they are away, which might provide helpful context to understand their preferences for camping accommodations (i.e., needing a pet-friendly option). However, the main focus of the dialogue is on camping preferences like tent, yurt, camper trailer, etc., which is not directly addressed in the MEMORY. Therefore, the MEMORY does not provide specific past information that supports the continuation of this particular conversation about camping choices.\n\nJudgement: No"
