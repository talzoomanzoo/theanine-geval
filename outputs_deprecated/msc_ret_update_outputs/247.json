    "raw_prediction": "I actually try to camp as often as I can during the summer months. It's a great way to disconnect and recharge. Plus, I love looking for wild animals in the woods. But I totally get your aversion to bugs. Maybe we can plan a camping trip for the cooler months when the bugs are less active.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context suggests Speaker B is talking about camping and possibly referring to bugs since they are asking if \"they\" can be that bad in the fall. It is helpful to know that Speaker B dislikes bugs and is not a fan of camping or hiking, which indicates they may have concerns about those aspects. Memory point 3 provides contextual information relevant to the conversation.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
