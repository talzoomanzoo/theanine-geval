    "raw_prediction": "Oh no, don't worry! I was just kidding. I may not be a cat person, but I still take good care of them and make sure they find loving homes. Just like how you leave Ginger and Pumpkin with your friend, I'll make sure these little ones are well taken care of. I can't have them feeling left out with all the Spice Girls' adventures going on!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context indicates that Speaker A is empathizing with Speaker B regarding the cats and suggests rehoming them properly to avoid accusations of animal abuse. The memory indicates that Speaker B is not a cat person but ends up taking care of stray cats brought home by kids. This past information is relevant and helpful because it explains the background context of why Speaker B might be facing a situation with cats.\nJudgement: Yes"
