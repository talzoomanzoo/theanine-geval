The relevant MEMORY would contain information about shoe sizes or past experiences that could influence the need for cleats. However, while MEMORY contains details about Speaker A's soccer involvement and teams they support, it does not provide any specific information about Speaker B's shoe size or needs related to cleats.\nJudgement: \"No\""
