    "raw_prediction": "I found Pulp Fiction to be both funny and intense. The dialogue and characters were so engaging, but yeah, I definitely wouldn't recommend it for kids. The violence and mature themes are pretty heavy. What do you think about that balance in movies, especially when watching with your kids?",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves a discussion about the suitability of the movie \"Pulp Fiction\" for children and whether it is considered funny or too violent. MEMORY contains information that Speaker B has kids and carefully selects movies, which is relevant for assessing the appropriateness of \"Pulp Fiction\" for children. Therefore, the past information about Speaker B's consideration for children's viewership is helpful.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
