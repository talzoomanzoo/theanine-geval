    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around a conversation about visiting different states in America and the differences in culture, focusing specifically on America. The MEMORY mostly contains information about origami and Speaker A's interest in it, which is unrelated to the current context. Therefore, MEMORY does not contain helpful past information for generating the next response in this conversation about America.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
