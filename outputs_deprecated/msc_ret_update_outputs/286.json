    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context is about choosing a simple dish to cook, specifically shrimp fried rice. The memory mentions Speaker B's husband being an avid cook and Speaker B not being skilled in cooking, but also that Speaker B is interested in learning about cooking. However, there is no mention of fried rice or shrimp in the memory, nor is there any information directly relevant to the current discussion about trying a simple dish. The context does not necessitate the use of past information for generating a response, as it is mainly about agreeing with a suggested dish.\nJudgement: N/A"
