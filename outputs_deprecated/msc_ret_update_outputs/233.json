MEMORY includes several pieces of information about Speaker A's parrot Tasha and their interest in adopting kittens, as well as Tasha's prior exposure to cats. This information helps understand the context about why Tasha might handle the situation well and appreciate watching them, indicating MEMORY contains relevant past information. \n\nJudgement: Yes"
