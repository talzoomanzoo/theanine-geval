    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear that you'll be visiting on your own. It will give you a chance to fully immerse yourself in the language and culture. Soap operas are a fun way to pick up some new phrases and get a feel for the language. I'm sure you'll have a fantastic time in Spain and Portugal!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context focuses on Speaker A's personal travel plans and the reason their spouse is not joining them. The memory primarily contains information about Speaker A's sons and their travels, which is not directly relevant to the specifics of Speaker A's solo travel or their interest in watching soap operas. Therefore, the past information is not needed to generate a relevant response.\nJudgement: \"N/A\""
