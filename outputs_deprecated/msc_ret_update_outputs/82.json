    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is asking about Speaker A's work at the library, which doesn't directly relate to the information in MEMORY about Speaker B's grandkids or Speaker A's work and family life. Since the context is regarding work and no specific past information in MEMORY is related to Speaker A's library job, the MEMORY does not contain helpful information for generating the next response.\nJudgement: No"
