    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: In the dialogue context, Speaker A mentions Journey, which is known from MEMORY to be a pet raccoon. Although MEMORY confirms that Speaker A also has dogs (as mentioned in MEMORY 2), it does not specifically address problems with dogs getting into food, only that Speaker A's dogs are peaceful. Therefore, MEMORY does not contain helpful information regarding the specific issue of dogs getting into food.\nJudgement: No"
