MEMORY points out Speaker A is planning a trip to Hawaii for the first time, suggesting additional context for their excitement, despite not being particularly fond of beaches. Thus, this past information from MEMORY is relevant and should be used in the response generation to better understand Speaker A's behavior.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
