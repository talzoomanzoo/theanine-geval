    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear that you're doing well! It's wonderful that you're so passionate about Greek mythology. I'm sure your daughter will love hearing all about it too. And thank you, I'm trying my best to save up for the Italy trip. It's exciting to have something to look forward to!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context refers to a conversation about an Italy trip and Greek mythology study. Memory 1 and 2 provide helpful information that Speaker B is interested in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology, which aligns with the context of the conversation. However, the trip mentioned in the context is to Italy, not Greece. Memory 3 relates to Speaker A's interest in Italian architecture and history, which connects to the Italy trip mentioned by Speaker B. Therefore, Memory 3 is also relevant to the context.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
