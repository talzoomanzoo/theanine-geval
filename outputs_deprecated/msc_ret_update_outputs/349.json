    "raw_prediction": "I totally get that! It's surprising how much sugar goes into desserts. Maybe you can try experimenting with low-sugar or sugar-free recipes to satisfy your sweet tooth without the guilt. You could even try making a healthier version of jello using natural sweeteners or fruit juices.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context involves Speaker B discussing watching baking videos and being surprised by the amount of sugar in desserts. The MEMORY contains details about jello and Speaker A's grandmother, but none of this information is directly relevant to the discussion on baking videos and sugar content in the context. Hence, the past memories don't contain helpful information for generating a response related to the current conversation topic.\nJudgement: No"
