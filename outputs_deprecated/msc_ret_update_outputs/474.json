    "prediction": "OUTPUT\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT discusses whether to bring more people on a trip, but it doesn't specify the details of the trip. MEMORY contains information about trips to Greece, preferences, and travel experiences that don't directly relate to the idea of bringing someone else along. The past trip plans don't provide the necessary context to answer the question at hand in the dialogue.\nJudgement: No"
