    "raw_prediction": "They can be painful, especially in certain areas, but the end result is always worth it for me. It's like a reminder of something important in my life every time I look at them. Maybe you could start with a small design in a less sensitive area to see how it feels for you.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context is asking specifically about the pain associated with Speaker A's tattoos. MEMORY provides information about Speaker A's tattoos, including that they enjoy getting tattoos, the number of tattoos they have, and that some are meaningful. This information suggests that Speaker A could provide insight into the pain level of tattoos since they have experience with multiple tattoos, which is relevant to the context of pain.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
