    "prediction": "OUTPUT\n\nBrief explanation: Speaker A is talking about encounters with wild animals during camping, indicating a familiarity and comfort with such situations. MEMORY contains information aligning with Speaker A's interest in camping and wildlife (e.g., enjoyment of camping trips, comfort with animals). Thus, MEMORY provides helpful background information for generating a response related to Speaker A's experiences.\nJudgement: Yes"
