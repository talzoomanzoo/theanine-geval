    "raw_prediction": "That's a smart approach with the dogs. It's important to ensure their safety while driving. Bandicoot has gotten used to his routine now, but it took some time to figure out what works best for him. It's all about trial and error, just like training any pet. Have you thought about getting a pet raccoon yourself? They can be quite the handful but also incredibly rewarding with the right care and attention.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT refers to Speaker A's practice of keeping dogs secured and mentions the brief duration they typically stay, which doesn't require any specific past information related to memory. The MEMORY primarily contains information related to Speaker B's raccoon and other pets, none of which seem directly relevant to the given context about Speaker A's dog experience. \nJudgement: \"No\""
