    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context involves a discussion about doing picnics and sleeping in tents, but does not relate directly to the information about Speaker B's involvement with the Boy Scouts or Speaker A's church activities. The memory does not provide specific past information or experiences that would aid in formulating a response to the question \"Where was the last place you went?\" regarding camping or picnicking experiences.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
