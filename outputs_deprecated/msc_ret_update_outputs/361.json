I like party, fighting, RPGs, shooters, action, adventure, and puzzle games. I enjoy playing Jurassic Park: World but I'd like to find another game to play. The storm means I'll be inside for a bit, so I think I'll curl up with some pizza and just zone out. Do you like to do anything else besides game when it's rainy?\n\n[MEMORY]\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n2. Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World.\n3. Speaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII.\n4. Speaker B mentions that Resident Evil can be scary and provides some tips for playing it.\n5. Speaker A prefers tamer video games and is not a fan of horror movies.\n6.

    "raw_prediction": "I'm the same way; I tend to gravitate towards games like RE even though they scare me! Besides gaming, I enjoy watching movies or reading a good book when it's rainy outside. It's the perfect excuse to relax and unwind. Maybe you can find a game that combines elements from different genres you enjoy to keep things interesting.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is asking for activities to do when it's rainy aside from gaming, while the MEMORY primarily contains information about preferences and experiences related to video games, specifically focusing on Resident Evil and other games Speaker A and B enjoy. Therefore, the past information regarding gaming preferences and plans may not directly assist in generating a response about non-gaming activities for a rainy day.\nJudgement: N/A"
