    "raw_prediction": "It's tough balancing work and family, but I'm sure they understand. Maybe you could introduce some creative activities at home to spark their interest in the outdoors.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around Speaker A's desire for their children to engage in outdoor or creative activities, despite being busy with work. MEMORY point 3 relates directly to this by noting that Speaker A is busy with work and spends less time with their kids, which aligns with the concern expressed in the dialogue context. Therefore, this memory could provide helpful context for generating the next response.\nJudgement: Yes"
