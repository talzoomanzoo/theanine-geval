The MEMORY contains information about Speaker B's background with raccoons and their pets Bandicoot and Bob, which relates to Speaker B's story about Bandicoot being a foster from animal control. This could be relevant and helpful for the Parent to generate a more informed response involving raccoons.\nJudgement: Yes"
