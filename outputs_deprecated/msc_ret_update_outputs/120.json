    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context is focused on an anecdote about Speaker A's preference for oatmeal raisin cookies, and how their brothers humorously refer to them. The MEMORY provided does not include information relevant to this subject, such as Speaker A's taste in cookies or their brothers' opinions about cookies. Thus, the MEMORY does not offer helpful past information for generating the next response.\n\nJudgement: No"
