    "raw_prediction": "I believe that vegetables like spinach, kale, broccoli, and carrots are fantastic for healing due to their high nutritional content. However, vegetables with high levels of pesticides or processed varieties might be best avoided for optimal healing benefits. What are your favorite vegetables to include in your meals?",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about vegetables that are good for healing. MEMORY does not include information about vegetables or healing in a nutritional context. Speaker A's background in Reiki and meditation might suggest they have knowledge about healing, but there's no explicit mention of healing dietary advice in the MEMORY.\nJudgement: \"No\""
