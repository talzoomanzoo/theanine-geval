Maybe you'll find some fun souvenirs related to them on your trip! Just remember to stick with your friend's advice to stay safe and enjoy all the unique experiences Alaska has to offer.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context involves a question regarding the origins of Rocky and Bullwinkle, which the MEMORY does not contain any relevant information about. The MEMORY primarily contains details about planning an Alaska trip and outdoor activities, which are not directly related to the context's question about Rocky and Bullwinkle.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
