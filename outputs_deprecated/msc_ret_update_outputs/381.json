    "raw_prediction": "I hadn't thought about adding their birth dates, that's a nice touch. I'll definitely take my time to pick the right font, thanks for the suggestion.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context discusses the idea of adding birth dates and choosing a font, which might be related to tattoos. Memory entries 1, 2, and 3 mention tattoos, which could contribute helpful information if the context of the conversation is about getting a tattoo. However, the dialogue context does not explicitly mention tattoos, making it ambiguous whether past details are necessary for the next response.\nJudgement: No"
