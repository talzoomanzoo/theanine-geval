    "raw_prediction": "Well, I can't resist those little faces when they're brought home by the kids! And who knows, maybe one day I'll have a change of heart towards cats too. But for now, I'll stick to being a dog person through and through. How about planning your next trip? Who's going to cat-sit this time?",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT discusses cats and Speaker A's fondness for them, comparing a new kitten to marmalade. The fact that Speaker B is not a cat person but takes care of strays (MEMORY 3) is directly relevant, as it explains Speaker A's surprise at Speaker B's non-cat person status. This memory provides context on Speaker B's relationship with cats.\nJudgement: Yes"
