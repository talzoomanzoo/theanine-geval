    "raw_prediction": "I've always been drawn to California. The weather is perfect for surfing and staying active. Plus, there are so many sports medicine opportunities there with all the professional teams. I can see myself settling down in a coastal town, enjoying the sun and the ocean. Italy sounds amazing too, by the way. The history and culture must be incredible to experience firsthand.",

Although Speaker B's background in sports medicine is mentioned in MEMORY, it is not directly relevant to the current topic of conversation regarding travel preferences and climate. Therefore, the past information in MEMORY is not needed to generate an appropriate response to the dialogue context.\n\nJudgement: N/A"
