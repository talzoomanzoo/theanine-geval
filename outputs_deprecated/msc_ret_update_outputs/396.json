    "raw_prediction": "I've made sure to childproof my apartment as much as possible, especially when it comes to dangerous items. I keep all chemicals, poisons, and medications securely locked away in cabinets Bandicoot can't access. As for car rides, I have a designated secure carrier for him. It's definitely safer for both of us that way, especially since Bandicoot can get a little too curious during drives.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context raises concerns about the safety and transportation of a pet raccoon named Bandicoot. MEMORY entry 6 confirms that Speaker B owns a raccoon named Bandicoot, which is relevant to the issues being discussed. This information is helpful as it provides context for why Speaker A is asking about safe practices with Bandicoot.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
