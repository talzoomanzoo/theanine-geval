Until then, I'm really looking forward to my Hawaii sunset tour. I'll be sure to share all the details with you when I get back!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context centers around travel experiences, specifically a trip to Italy. The MEMORY documents primarily focus on movie preferences and plans related to a Hawaii trip. Therefore, the MEMORY does not contain information that would directly assist in generating a response to a question about traveling to Italy.\nJudgement: \"No\""
