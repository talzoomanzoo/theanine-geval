I'm thrilled to hear that things are going better at your programmer job. Finding your stride in a new role can take some time, but it sounds like you're getting there. If you ever need a break from coding, I have a great comedy recommendation for you!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context is focusing on teaching and the experience of teaching, with no mention of movies or movie preferences. The MEMORY contains information about Speaker B's movie knowledge and preferences, which does not relate to the current context of discussing teaching experiences. Therefore, past information from MEMORY is not needed to generate a response in this context.\n\nJudgement: \"N/A\""
