Getting married on the 4th of July sounds incredible! It's like having your own annual celebration with fireworks to mark the occasion.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context mentions Speaker A's love for Disney World and fireworks, and their desire to get married on the 4th of July. The memory provides information about Speaker A's interests in Disney music, museums, and travel plans, but none of these specifically relate to Disneyland or their desire to get married on the 4th of July. Therefore, the memory does not contain helpful past information relevant to the discussion of Disney parks or fireworks.\n\nJudgement: No"
