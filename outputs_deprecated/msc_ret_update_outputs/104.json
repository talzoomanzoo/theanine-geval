Bears can be a concern in certain areas of Alaska, but as long as you take the necessary precautions and stay informed about where you are, you should be fine. Just be bear-aware and keep your distance if you happen to encounter any. Remember, safety first!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context involves Speaker B planning to call a friend for information about the current season to pack appropriately and mentions a curiosity about bears in Alaska.
