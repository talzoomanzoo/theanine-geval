    "prediction": "OUTPUT\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context focuses on Speaker B teaching their kids a particular jello recipe, which implies prior knowledge or interest in jello. The memory provides information that Speaker B enjoys jello and is interested in learning cooking or baking. However, it doesn't clearly connect to them teaching their kids a recipe, but it might hint at an underlying interest or recent development in learning or sharing such skills. Thus, some indirect relevance might exist.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
