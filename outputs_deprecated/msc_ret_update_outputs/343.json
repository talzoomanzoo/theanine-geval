    "raw_prediction": "I agree with you. Pulp Fiction has its moments of humor, but the violence is definitely intense. I would also lean towards not recommending it for kids unless they are older and mature enough to handle it. It's always best for parents or grandparents to make that decision based on what they feel is appropriate for their children.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT discusses the appropriateness of a movie for children. MEMORY includes that Speaker B has kids and enjoys watching movies with them, which could inform their opinion on appropriate movies for children.\nJudgement: Yes"
