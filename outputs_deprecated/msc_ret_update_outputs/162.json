    "prediction": "OUTPUT\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around Speaker A seeking food recommendations, presumably for their upcoming trip to Hawaii. None of the details in MEMORY relate to specific dishes or culinary recommendations, as they focus more on movies and general information about traveling to Hawaii. Thus, MEMORY does not contain the helpful information needed for the specific inquiry about food recommendations.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
