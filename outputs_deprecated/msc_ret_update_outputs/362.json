    "raw_prediction": "I've heard of Ring Fit Adventure, it's a great way to stay active while gaming. I might give it a try sometime. I usually just stick to playing games on my console or PC, but it's good to have some variety. I might look into some new games to try out soon.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The current conversation is about housekeeping activities and gaming, particularly the Ring Fit Adventure. While MEMORY contains information about gaming preferences and specific games like Resident Evil, it does not mention anything about Ring Fit Adventure or physical activity-related games, which are the focus of the current dialogue. Therefore, MEMORY does not have information specifically helpful for responding to the mention of Ring Fit Adventure in this context.\nJudgement: No"
