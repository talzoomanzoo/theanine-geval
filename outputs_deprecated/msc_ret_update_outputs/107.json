    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context involves Speaker A inquiring if Speaker B will have a friend act as their guide for a hiking trip. MEMORY contains information about Speaker B's uncertainty about activities in Alaska other than hiking and other relevant details about their Alaskan trip planning. However, it does not provide any helpful information about whether Speaker B has a friend to act as a hiking guide. Thus, MEMORY lacks the specific historical information necessary to aid in generating a proper next response.\n\nJudgement: No"
