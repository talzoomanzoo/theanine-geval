    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The dialogue context simply shows that Classmate A wants to talk about something. The exact topic of discussion is not given thus we cannot determine definitively if the memory would be helpful or not. It can still give some possible background information about the relationship history and dynamics between A and B, but no specific information from the memory is required to generate the next response.\nJudgement: N/A"
