    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The dialogue context refers to Neighbor A showing off their increase in strength, but none of the points in the memory provide information about this. The memory revolves around their friendship and a situation with some cut wood, which does not relate to Neighbor A's question. Hence the memory does not contain any helpful information for generating a proper response.\nJudgement: \"No\""
