    "raw_prediction": "It's completely normal to feel that way, Mentee. Remember, it takes time to build new relationships. Just be yourself and don't be afraid to put yourself out there. You'll find your place soon enough. And in the meantime, don't forget to take care of yourself and practice self-care.",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory contains the Mentee's backstory; the Mentee's move to the new city due to a job offer and the knowledge that they have felt overwhelmed in the past. All these could help the model to generate a proper response about making new friends, coping with feelings of loneliness, or advice about settling in a new city.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
