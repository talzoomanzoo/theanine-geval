    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The dialogue context revolves around the Parentâ€™s appreciation for the skill of being a good listener. The MEMORY items here broadly describe the sentiments of the child towards the parent and vice versa, but do not provide specific information pertaining to the skill of listening. Hence, the MEMORY doesn't contain any helpful past information that could be used by a language model to craft a proper response.\nJudgement: No"
