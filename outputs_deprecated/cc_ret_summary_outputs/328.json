    "raw_prediction": "Well, it's just that I completely froze during that emergency drill earlier. I couldn't think straight and panicked. It made me realize how important it is to stay calm and think clearly in difficult situations, like you did when we were stranded in space. You handled it so well, and it's something I really admire about you.",
