    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory does not provide any useful information for generating a response to the dialogue context. The dialogue context is about Neighbor A marking a boundary line to clearly distinguish property lines, while the memory is about their relationship and shared activities, which does not relate to the main idea of the context.\nJudgement: No"
