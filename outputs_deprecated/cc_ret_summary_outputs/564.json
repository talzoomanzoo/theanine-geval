    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY provides some background about the preferences and relationship between both classmates, which may be helpful to direct the language model to generate a response that aligns with those preferences. However, the DIALOGUE CONTEXT does not ask for information needing this background. Thus, it does not critically rely on past information.\nJudgement: \"N/A\""
