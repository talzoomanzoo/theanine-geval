    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The dialogue context talks about Neighbor A marking a boundary line on the wall to highlight where his/her property ends and Neighbor B's begins; it has nothing to do with the neighbors helping each other, working out, reading and sharing books, being supportive, setting goals, developing positivity, taking actions for personal development and career advancement, or borrowing a book, as mentioned in the memory. Thus, the memory doesn't contain relevant information.\nJudgement: \"No\""
