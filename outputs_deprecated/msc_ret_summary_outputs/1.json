    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY contains information that Speaker B plans on going for a trip, although it does not explicitly mention anything about the means Speaker B might use to travel or if Speaker B has purchased plane tickets. However, Speaker B got a new car and plans to drive during spring break. This information could hint at the possibility of Speaker B not needing to purchase plane tickets which could help AA generate the right response.\nJudgement: Yes"
