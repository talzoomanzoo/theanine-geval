    "raw_prediction": "That makes sense. Fostering is a great way to provide temporary care and love for dogs in need without the long-term commitment. It's wonderful that you're able to help them find forever homes.",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The dialogue context shows that Speaker A wants to solve a raccoon problem using aluminum sheeting. However, the information provided in the memory could help Speaker B provide another -non-violent or more caring- solution, since Speaker B has experience with raccoons and believes they can make good pets.\nJudgement: Yes"
