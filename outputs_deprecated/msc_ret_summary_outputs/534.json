    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY provides additional context, such as Speaker A and B planning a trip together, Speaker B's initial limited ideas about what to do there, as well as Speaker A's general familiarity with outdoor activities in Alaska. However, none of these elements contain specific 'helpful' information that would be essential for crafting a direct response to the given dialogue context.\nJudgement: No"
