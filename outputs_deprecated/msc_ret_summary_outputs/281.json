    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory does not contain any helpful past information for the model to generate the next response, as Speaker B appears to be the one with the jello recipe tradition, not Speaker A. The dialogue context also does not require any reference to past events.\nJudgement: \"N/A\""
