    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The dialogue context suggests that Speaker A is referring to Speaker B's pets as 'little furries'. Memory items tell us that Speaker B has pets, specifically five dogs and three rats. Given this information, these pets could be the 'little furries' Speaker A is asking about. \nJudgement: Yes"
