    "raw_prediction": "That does sound like a dream job, being out in nature as a guide. I can see you really enjoying that kind of work. And hiking is a great way to recharge and have some alone time. Maybe we can plan another hiking trip soon to catch up and enjoy the outdoors together.",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory gives us detailed background information about Speaker A's personal interests, past actions, and on-going plans related to his new job and hobbies. However, the dialogue context about the grocery store offering Speaker A a job does not require any of this past data. Any potential response by the language model to the current dialogue line would not necessarily need to refer back to this background information.\nJudgement: N/A"
