    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The dialogue context is about Speaker B asking Speaker A about their job at a computer company, but the memory does not provide any relevant information regarding Speaker A working for a computer company. Instead, it talks about Speaker A's fondness for certain topics and their work for a small local business. This is inconsistent with the dialogue context and does not provide any helpful information for generating a proper next response.\nJudgement: \"No\""
