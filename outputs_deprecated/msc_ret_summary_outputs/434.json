    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY does not provide any useful information for the Unknown to make a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The dialogue context is about Speaker A getting a job offer from a grocery store, but the past information doesn't contain anything that directly relates to this job offer or Speaker A's potential responses to it. The information about Speaker A's personality and hobbies, Speaker B's friend, and John's situation can't help to respond to the current context.\nJudgement: \"No\""
