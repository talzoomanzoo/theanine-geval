    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The helpful information in the memory includes the detail about Speaker A working in a restaurant that gives her two free meals a week, which helps to contextualize her enthusiasm about a new dish being added to the menu as she would have an opportunity to taste it for free. However, this detail is already somewhat implied in the dialogue context, but not explicitly mentioned, in which sense the memory provides a clearer context.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
