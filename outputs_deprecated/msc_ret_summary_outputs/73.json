The MEMORY mainly involves information about Speaker A's trip to Hawaii, their jobs, and Speaker B's enjoyment of watching movies with her kids. None of these pieces of information provide helpful past information for generating an appropriate response to Speaker A's comment on the movie \"Miracle\".\nJudgement: \"No\""
