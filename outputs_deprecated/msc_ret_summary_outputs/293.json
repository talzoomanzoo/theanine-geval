    "raw_prediction": "How about trying out something like Jurassic Park: World? It's a fun game with a different vibe compared to Resident Evil. Plus, it's always nice to mix things up and try something new!",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The dialogue context is about Speaker A's experience of playing Resident Evil. In the memory, there are multiple references to Speaker A planning to play and his hesitation due to the horror nature of Resident Evil. This information could provide essential background for Speaker's next response with respect to these possible reservations and experiences shared. So, the memory contains helpful past information for the language model to generate a proper next response based on the dialogue context.\nJudgement: Yes"
