    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory does not provide any information that would be beneficial to a language model in order to generate a proper response in the given dialogue context. It mostly focuses on Speaker A and their relationship with jello making, whereas the dialogue context is about Speaker B teaching their kids to make their grandmother's jello recipe.\nJudgement: No"
