    "prediction": "Brief explanation: Given the dialogue context reveals that Speaker B is teaching their kids a jello recipe, the memory mentions that Speaker A has also learned jello recipes from their grandmother and suggest Speaker B can consider their own grandmother as a surrogate for these purposes. Therefore, the memory is providing significant background on a shared interest/activity and it is relevant.\nJudgement: Yes"
