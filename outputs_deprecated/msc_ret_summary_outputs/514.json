    "raw_prediction": "It's a shame to hear about the decline in interest in libraries, especially with all the effort you put into creative activities. Maybe we can find a way to incorporate some of those activities into our annual fishing trip to get the grandkids more interested in nature and learning at the same time.",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY contains useful information regarding the fact that Speaker B has grandkids and their interaction with them. This information is relevant as Speaker A's question is related to grandkids and technology use. Speaker B can use this information to provide a context-specific response.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
