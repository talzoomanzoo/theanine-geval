    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information about Speaker B's knowledge about and experience with raccoons, as well as Speaker A's previous plan to buy aluminum sheeting for the raccoon issue. As the DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves Speaker A's actions to solve the raccoon problem with the purchased aluminum sheeting, the memory data about raccoons and Speaker A's solutions might be helpful in generating an empathetic or advice-oriented response. \nJudgement: \"Yes\""
