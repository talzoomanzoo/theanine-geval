    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about Speaker A purchasing a new iPhone which they consider expensive. The MEMORY, however, is about both Speaker A and Speaker B discussing, purchasing, and discussing their strategies for playing the lotto. There is no connection between the two scenarios that would require past information to generate a proper response.\nJudgement: No"
