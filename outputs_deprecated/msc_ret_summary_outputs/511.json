    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory contains useful information that can help in generating a response to Speaker A's question. It tells us that Speaker B has grandkids who are more interested in phones and tablets (Memory 4). This implies that Speaker B's grandchildren are tech-savvy and therefore itâ€™s probable that they use technology for interaction.\nJudgement: Yes"
