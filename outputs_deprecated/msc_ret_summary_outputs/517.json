The memory, which records past interactions and revelations about Speakers A and B, confirms that Speaker B does have grandkids. This information is relevant to the context as it establishes that Speaker B indeed has grandchildren to communicate with, which would be the basis of their response to Speaker A's question.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
