    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory does not contain any crucial information that would be needed by the language model to generate a proper next response, given the dialogue context. The fact that Speaker B has been teaching his/her kids to make their grandmother's jello recipe does not require any knowledge about Speaker A's past experiences with jello or cooking.\nJudgement: \"No\""
