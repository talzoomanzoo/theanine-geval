    "raw_prediction": "I agree, Pulp Fiction definitely has its funny moments but it can be quite violent. I would probably wait until my kids are a bit older before letting them watch it. It's always good to let parents make that decision for their own children.",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The dialogue context shows Speaker A expressing satisfaction about a movie they watched based on Speaker B's recommendation. This is directly related to the MEMORY where it mentions that Speaker B makes movie recommendations for Speaker A and that Speaker A depends on Speaker B for such suggestions. Such information could help the model to generate the next response. For example, Speaker B may further recommend similar movies or inquire more about Speaker A's views on Pulp Fiction.\nJudgement: Yes"
