Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you. Speaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden.\n2. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing.\n3. Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more.\n4. Speaker A jokes about space weeds and expresses a desire to see space.\n5. Speaker A plays the clarinet in a band concert and has a solar investment for their office building.\n6. Speaker A's parents are teachers.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds lovely! I'll definitely consider plum and pear trees for my garden. Do you have any tips on how to care for them during the different seasons?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains helpful information that could assist in generating a response for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, the fact that Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening (Memory point 1) is relevant, as it aligns with Speaker A seeking gardening suggestions. This background helps explain why Speaker B provided the suggestion of plum and pair trees. \n\nHowever, the other points in the MEMORY are less directly relevant to continuing the dialogue around gardening. For example, Speaker A's interest in space plants (Memory point 2) and space weeds (Memory point 4) are more tangential to the gardening discussion. Similarly, information about Speaker A playing the clarinet (Memory point 5) and their parents being teachers (Memory point 6) doesn't naturally connect to the current dialogue. Memory point 3, about Speaker B's plans to work in the garden more, is somewhat relevant but lacks a direct link to the current topic of choosing plants for a garden.\n\nOverall, while there is some relevant memory content, the lack of strong connectivity and direct causation between most of the sentences and the current topic of gardening limits the helpfulness of the MEMORY."
