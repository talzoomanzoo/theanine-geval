Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend.\n2. Speaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo.\n3. Speaker A prefers cockatoos over kittens as pets.\n4. Speaker B likes poetry and fantasy books, and has a pet cat.\n5. Speaker B's girlfriend has a cockatoo that makes a lot of noise.\n6. Speaker A has a sister who owns a corgi.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information for generating a response by Speaker B, specifically focusing on the first sentence about Speaker B considering adopting a kitten from a friend. This is directly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A asks if Speaker B has decided to adopt one of the kittens. The rest of the memory sentences provide additional context about Speaker B's interests and existing pets, which may not be directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but can still offer insights into Speaker B's personality and lifestyle. The connections between the sentences in the MEMORY are somewhat vague, and the causality or relevancy is not explicitly clear, resulting in a mid-level score."
