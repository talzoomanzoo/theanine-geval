Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college? Speaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position.  Speaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it? Speaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days.  Speaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n2. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.\n3. Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n4. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n5. Speaker A is a fan of Arsenal and enjoys watching international teams play.\n6. Speaker A is a college student studying Humanities and wants to finish college before looking for a job.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like an exciting career goal! Being a voice on a soccer video game would be a great way to stay connected to the sport and share your passion with others. Have you thought about how you might pursue that path after finishing college?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It confirms Speaker B's experience with soccer, which aligns with Speaker B's mention of playing as a goalkeeper in college in the context. Additionally, it brings in Speaker B's interest in a specific soccer team (Manchester United), which is relevant for a soccer-focused conversation. Speaker A's interest in soccer is also notable, aligning with their desire to become a voice for soccer video games, and Speaker A's membership on a team and scoring well recently could relate to their enthusiasm for being involved in that industry. However, the MEMORY contains some information that isn't directly related to the current context, like Speaker A's studies in Humanities, and not all connections or causations are clearly demonstrated regarding how these past interactions might influence future responses within the given dialogue. This mixed relevance results in a middling score."
