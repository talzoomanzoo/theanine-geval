Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company? Do you build computers or work on programming? Speaker B: I do like my job. My job is to troubleshoot issues between the hardware and software, so I get to work with both. Speaker A: That sounds interesting. That's great that you love your job, not many people do. Speaker B: Love is a strong word! I do like it though. There have been jobs I hated and I'm great full not be in that place. Hows you job going?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B works for a computer company and is unable to change careers until their child graduates.\n2. Speaker A enjoys reading books about ice cream, Disney World, and computers.\n3. Speaker A works for a small local business with a demanding schedule.\n4. Speaker B's mother is a dentist and loves her job.\n5. Speaker A is torn between choosing a career in dentistry for the money or working at Disney for happiness.\n6. Speaker A is considering a career in dentistry but is also interested in working at Disney for happiness.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information, such as Speaker B working for a computer company. However, other details, such as Speaker A's interests in books or potential career in dentistry, are unrelated to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The fact that Speaker B cannot change careers until their child graduates is loosely connected to the dialogue about job satisfaction, but it's not directly applicable to the conversation at hand. Overall, the MEMORY lacks a clear connection and causality to the dialogue, making it not particularly helpful for generating the next response."
