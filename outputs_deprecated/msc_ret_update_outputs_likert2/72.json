Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play?  Speaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music. Speaker A: ah right, who's your favourite rock band? Speaker B: I'm big fan of aerosmith. When do you learn music. Whom teach you?

Still I didn't get right teacher. I'm jealous on you. I don't have like your dad. Speaker A: what instrument have you been trying to learn?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is in a band and plays music, possibly a musician.\n2. Speaker B is willing to teach Speaker A how to fish and cook.\n3.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a few details that could potentially relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A being involved in a band and playing an instrument, which aligns with A mentioning playing drums. However, most sentences in the MEMORY do not directly contribute to creating a coherent or causally linked response in the current context. Speaker B's willingness to teach fishing and cooking or their interest in surfing doesn't relate to the music-themed conversation in the dialogue context. Moreover, there is no clear connection to the ongoing discussion about learning music or having a musician father. For these reasons, the helpfulness score is relatively low."
