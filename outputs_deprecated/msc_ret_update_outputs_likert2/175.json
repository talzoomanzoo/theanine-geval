Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me? Speaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week? Speaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day Speaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through Speaker A: Actually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested. Speaker B: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to it. Do you think I will need to rent a car when I'm there, or is it possible to walk and bike in the summer? I always picture huge amounts of snow but I'm not sure if it's like that all year round. Speaker A: I would definitely recommend looking for a rental car to have on hand. There is a town within walking distance from me, but it can be dangerous to walk with the wolves and elk around, especially at night. Speaker B: I imagine so!!! I wouldn't want to run into a wolf! Ok. I will add car rental to my plans. Do you get scared with your dogs, that you will run into wildilfe like that? Speaker A: I think I'm more afraid of the wildlife than my dogs are. If I had to, I think I could muster the courage to face the animals out here, but I will happily avoid them when possible. With you around, I'd feel much better, as well. How do you feel about being that close to wildlife? Speaker B: Well I don't have a lot of experience with that but I guess I'd be ok as long as I knew what to do. Most of the wildlife I see is squirrels, pigeons, and the occasional possum.  Speaker A: We have plenty of those out here, as well, and you'll see them far more often than you'll see wolves. We will just have to take extra precautions at night and make sure we don't leave any food outside that might attract them.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mentioned the wildlife, including elk and wolves.\n2. Speaker B is planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n3. Speaker B is interested in going whale watching and asks about a wolf petting zoo.\n4. Speaker A suggests going on hikes in Alaska to see wildlife and mentions glaciers as a potential attraction.\n5. Speaker A has invited Speaker B to visit them and is excited about the trip.\n6. Speaker A plans to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'll definitely keep that in mind and follow your lead when it comes to wildlife safety. I trust your judgment on that. It sounds like a thrilling experience, and I'm excited to learn more about the local wildlife during my visit.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information that are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A mentioning wildlife (elk and wolves), Speaker B's plan to visit, and the folk concert. These elements align with the ongoing conversation about the visit and wildlife. However, some parts of the MEMORY introduce irrelevant or inaccurate information, such as \"petting a wolf\" and \"whale watching,\" which are not mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, potentially leading to confusion. Additionally, the mention of \"going on glacier tours\" is not directly tied to the current conversation. The continuity and connection between events aren't fully established in the MEMORY, preventing it from receiving a higher score."
