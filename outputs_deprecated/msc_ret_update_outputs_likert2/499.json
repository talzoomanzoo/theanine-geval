Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive. Speaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price? Speaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B have a friendly interaction and part ways on a positive note.\n2. Speaker A enjoys the peace and quiet of country life, the fresh produce, and fresh air.\n3. Speaker B appreciates the convenience of city living but also values what the country has to offer.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n5. Speaker A used to live in a suburb of DC and misses the convenience of city life.\n6. Speaker A bought 50 lotto tickets with different numbers to increase their chances of winning.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some information about Speaker A and Speaker B's past interactions and their preferences, but it lacks direct relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Speaker A's new iPhone purchase and music apps. The sentences in the MEMORY seem scattered and touch on different topics like living preferences and lottery tickets, which don't directly contribute to generating a natural next response to the current conversation about the iPhone and music. The connections between the MEMORY statements aren't particularly strong, leading to a lower helpfulness score."
