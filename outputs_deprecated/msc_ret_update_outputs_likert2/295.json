Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and their brother enjoy going to a Brazilian steakhouse for dinner.\n2. Speaker A's brother enjoys Brazilian food, specifically steak.\n3. Speaker A enjoys salsa dancing and is planning to go out dancing.\n4. Speaker A is planning to take their clients salsa dancing for fun.\n5. Speaker B's family enjoys dancing on the boat at night under the stars.\n6. Speaker B works as a bartender and enjoys meeting different people.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad you had a great time! Brazilian food is always a hit. Have you tried making any Brazilian dishes at home?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information about Speaker A's enjoyment of Brazilian food, which connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT mentioning they had Brazilian foods. However, other sentences in the MEMORY, such as salsa dancing or Speaker B working as a bartender, are not directly relevant to generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about the Black Widow movie and Brazilian foods. Additionally, the connections between the memories are not clearly demonstrated, making it less helpful overall."
