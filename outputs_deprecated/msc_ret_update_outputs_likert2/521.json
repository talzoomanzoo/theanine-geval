Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer? Speaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to? Speaker A: The museum has all sorts of galleries.  It has a sculpture garden outside.  I mostly like the impressionist paintings.  I like Van Gogh.  Was your concert outdoors?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys going to museums and trying different foods.\n2. Speaker A is interested in music concerts and planning a trip to Sao Paulo.\n3. Speaker A is planning to visit the Museum of Art of São Paulo next week with their boyfriend.\n4. Speaker B is waiting for bands to announce their summer tour schedule to plan which shows to attend.\n5. Speaker B recommends visiting the Museum of Art of São Paulo in the city.\n6.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it lacks specific details that would directly aid in generating a proper response to the current conversation. The MEMORY mentions Speaker A's interest in museums and concerts, which is pertinent. However, it does not directly address the details about the concert on the fourth of July or highlight whether it was outdoors. Furthermore, the provided connections between events (e.g., Speaker A's travel plans or museum visits) do not directly inform the given context. The MEMORY could be improved by incorporating more direct and causal connections related to the specifics of the ongoing conversation, such as prior concerts attended by Speaker B or specific museum experiences shared with Speaker A."
