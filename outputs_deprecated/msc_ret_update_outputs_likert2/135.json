Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job. Speaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career. Speaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday. Speaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n3. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n4. Speaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\n5. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n6. Speaker A is involved with a football league and is looking forward to playing games.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you! I'm lucky to have their support. It's great to see you exploring teaching as well. It's a rewarding career path that aligns with your passion for linguistics. Have you thought about any specific areas within teaching that interest you the most?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around career choices, specifically teaching, and MEMORIES #1, #2, and #5 are directly related to this topic. They mention Speaker A's interest in teaching robotics and Speaker B's consideration of becoming a college professor, which aligns with the discussion about teaching.\n\nHowever, MEMORY #3, while relevant, is partially contextually supportive since it relates to Speaker B's field of study. MEMORY #4 and #6 are less relevant to the immediate context of the dialogue which is centered on career discussions and teaching. MEMORY #6, which mentions football, is particularly unrelated to the dialogue context of teaching careers, and MEMORY #4 about volunteer work could be slightly relevant but doesn't connect clearly to the dialogue about their stresses and interests in career choices.\n\nOverall, the necessary connections are partially there, but could be tighter and more focused on the specifics discussed in the dialogue context to be more helpful."
