Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n2. Speaker A used to live in a suburb of DC and misses the convenience of city life.\n3. Speaker A bought 50 lotto tickets with different numbers to increase their chances of winning.\n4. Speaker A works on a family farm and will be using the new truck for farm work.\n5. Speaker B is open to moving to the country to be further away from neighbors.\n6. Speaker B's children have been sick, and Speaker B also had a fever, possibly influencing their decision to buy 20 lotto tickets.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some tangential context but lacks direct relevance or clear causality related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Speaker A buying an expensive new iPhone. The entries about buying lotto tickets and living arrangements do not directly support or enhance the understanding of the current conversation about the iPhone purchase. While there is some context about Speaker A and Speaker B's past interactions, these do not directly relate to the expensive purchase or potential financial concerns, which might have been more relevant. The connection between the MEMORY events and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is not obvious, hence a low helpfulness score."
