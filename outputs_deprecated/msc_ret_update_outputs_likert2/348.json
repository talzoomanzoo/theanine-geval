Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on! Speaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar. Speaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes.\n2. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n3. Speaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners.\n4. Speaker A is eating their favorite jello.\n5. Speaker B also enjoys jello, with cherry being their favorite flavor as well.\n6. Speaker B does not do a lot of cooking or baking but is interested in learning.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that is helpful for generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It provides details on both Speaker A's and Speaker B's connections to jello and their family traditions, which ties into the discussion about teaching kids to make jello recipes. This background information is useful for Speaker B to maintain the current discussion on family traditions and cooking, and to perhaps relate with Speaker A. However, it could be improved by explicitly mentioning the connection between the weight/gaining sugar context and dessert/jello, as the last part of Speaker A's query could have been better addressed. That's why it didn't receive a perfect score of 5."
