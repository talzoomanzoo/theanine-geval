Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on! Speaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar. Speaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general? Speaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes.\n2. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n3. Speaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners.\n4. Speaker A is eating their favorite jello.\n5. Speaker B does not do a lot of cooking or baking but is interested in learning.\n6. Speaker B also enjoys jello, with cherry being their favorite flavor as well.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I totally get that! It's surprising how much sugar goes into desserts. Maybe you can try experimenting with low-sugar or sugar-free recipes to satisfy your sweet tooth without the guilt. You could even try making a healthier version of jello using natural sweeteners or fruit juices.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information but lacks a naturally connected narrative that would clearly support generating a proper next response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Points 1, 2, and 3 mention Speaker A's connection to jello and their grandmother's recipes, which could be slightly relevant to Speaker B's interest in baking and learning recipes. However, there is no clear indication of this relevance in the current dialogue. \n\nPoints 5 and 6 provide background information about Speaker B's interest in learning to cook or bake, which is somewhat helpful in understanding Speaker B's context, but it doesn't directly contribute to the current theme of needing to lay off sugar. \n\nIn summary, the MEMORY provides some relevant background information but lacks clear causal or relevant connections that enhance the dialogue context."
