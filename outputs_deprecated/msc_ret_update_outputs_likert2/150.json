Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I did! Joshua was looking majestic as always. Have you ever taken your daughter to see the tigers at the zoo?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful information for Speaker A to generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights that Speaker A is a regular visitor to the zoo and enjoys seeing specific animals like tigers and monkeys, which could lead to naturally connected topics about animals, zoos, or visits. It also mentions a specific tiger named Joshua, aligning with the question about Joshua at the end of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the information about Speaker B being a parent, and their child's interest in visiting the zoo, complements the conversation's direction. However, there are some details like Speaker A's suggestion to take pets to the zoo, which might not directly connect to the conversation's flow. Overall, the relevant connections to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT result in a fair level of helpfulness."
