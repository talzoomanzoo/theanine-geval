Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a painter and is working on a portrait for Speaker A.\n2. Speaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals, discovered love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets.\n3. Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions.\n4. Speaker A has a brother and might commission a family portrait from Speaker B.\n5. Speaker B has 5 dogs of different breeds and has rats as pets but didn't include them in the portrait.\n6. Both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy the company of their pets and think they are smart and playful.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides several useful pieces of information that are highly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically:\n\n- It confirms that Speaker B is indeed a painter working on a portrait for Speaker A, which directly relates to Speaker A's comment about the portrait's progress.\n- It mentions Speaker B's interest in portraits and pets, matching Speaker A's inquiry about the \"little furries,\" suggesting a shared interest in animals that could inform Speaker B's response. \n- The MEMORY discusses both speakersâ€™ fondness for pets, which is relevant to Speaker A's question and can guide Speaker B towards a discussion about pets, helping in generating a natural and connected response.\n- It includes background information, such as Speaker B's preference in painting and Speaker A's potential interest in commissioning another portrait, which could be used contextually to steer the conversation.\n\nThe only reason this isn't a 5 is that not all the sentences are equally directly beneficial for the next immediate response. However, the overall connections are logical and assist in understanding the dynamic of the conversation, making it quite helpful."
