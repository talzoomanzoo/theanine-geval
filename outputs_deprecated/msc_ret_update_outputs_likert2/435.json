Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it. Speaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it. Speaker A: Cool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot. What is your favorite part about camping? Speaker B: I love being out in the wilderness and sleeping under the stars in the fresh air. It makes you realize how beautiful life is and how small we really are in comparison to the universe. Speaker A: I miss doing that! I have done lots of picnics with my family but it's been a long time since I've slept in a tent! Looking forward to it again when the kids are older. Where was the last place you went?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat.\n2. Speaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout.\n3. Speaker B is busy with scouts, school, work, and tennis, but willing to take vacation days for the retreat.\n4. Speaker A is involved in church activities and mentioned a church retreat\n5. Speaker B is a member of the boy scouts and works at a fast food place\n6. Speaker B plans to earn the Eagle Scout badge for college applications.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "The last camping trip I went on was to a national park a few hours away. We hiked through the trails, cooked our meals over the campfire, and even saw some wildlife up close. It was such a memorable experience, and I can't wait for the next adventure.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful background information which could assist a language model in generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It indicates Speaker B's extensive experience with the Boy Scouts, which aligns with the current topic of discussion. Specifically, the mention of Speaker B's involvement with the Boy Scouts for 7-8 years and consideration of becoming an Eagle Scout could be quite relevant and helpful in emphasizing the depth of Speaker B's experience in outdoor activities and survival skills.\n\nHowever, while there are pieces of relevant information, there is no direct connection between these points in MEMORY and the ongoing DIALOGUE CONTEXT about favorite camping places or the recent camping location of Speaker B. There are some disjointed parts like mentioning church activities and fast food working, which do not clearly contribute to generating the next response. To be more helpful, the MEMORY could include more about past camping experiences or specific skills learned, which would naturally connect with the current topic.\n"
