    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone?  Speaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!).\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks.\n2. Speaker B got into motivational speaking because they needed it themselves to battle depression and anxiety.\n3. Speaker B's job involves motivating people to be successful and follow their dreams.\n4. Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600.\n5. Speaker A is training for marathons and seeking advice on how to recover.\n6. Speaker B is considering running a marathon and mentioned fishing and feeling depressed.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's fantastic to hear! Your passion for motivating others really shines through. With your enthusiasm and energy, I have no doubt you would make an excellent motivational speaker for my friend. Let's set up a meeting to discuss the details and get them back on track with their running goals.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a good amount of helpful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It connects the fact that Speaker B is a motivational speaker and has experience with depression and anxiety, which can make them a credible and relatable motivational speaker for others, including Speaker A's friend. Furthermore, the MEMORY mentions past interactions where Speaker A and Speaker B discussed running and marathons, which is directly relevant to Speaker A's request for motivation to run. The connection between the MEMORY and the current context is clear and useful, making it easier to generate a coherent response related to Speaker A's need for a motivational speaker. However, the information could be linked more explicitly, which prevents it from achieving a perfect score."
