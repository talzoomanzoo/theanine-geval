Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends? Speaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do. Speaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars. Speaker B: Yeah, I think they go dark for a couple months and then have daylight for a couple months! I actually like night time, but having daylight all the time will make me crazy lol. Yeah I kind of hope it's dark for the camping but it will be very cold. I have heard Alaska has delicious ice cream. I want to try that while I'm there,  Speaker A: You'd have to get some serious blackout curtains for when it was daylight lol! You'll have to stock up on some warm essentials before heading out. You definitely don't want to get stuck in a bad situation in the cold, especially if you're alone. I bet they have great ice cream! You'll have to tell me about it when you get back!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mentions the outdoor activities they plan to do in Alaska, such as hiking.\n2. Speaker A has the impression that Alaska is cold and snowy, wondering if there are ski slopes there.\n3. Speaker B is unsure about what else there is to do in Alaska besides hiking.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together.\n5. Speaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet.\n6. Speaker A mentions that Alaska has mountains and glaciers, unsure if skiing is possible there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided does not offer much relevant information for generating a proper next response in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Most of the memory points focus on general activities, such as hiking, skiing, and the fact that Speaker B hasn't planned much yet, which does not directly relate to the specific activities discussed in the context (e.g., sledding with dogs and eating ice cream). Additionally, the mention of Alaska's cold and snowy conditions is indirectly relevant but already known from the context. Furthermore, the connection and development between the past interactions of the speakers in MEMORY seem disjointed and not clearly relevant to the ongoing conversation, lacking clear causality or relevancy. Therefore, the memory provides little helpful information for generating the subsequent dialogue response."
