Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me? Speaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week? Speaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day Speaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through Speaker A: Actually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested. Speaker B: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to it. Do you think I will need to rent a car when I'm there, or is it possible to walk and bike in the summer? I always picture huge amounts of snow but I'm not sure if it's like that all year round. Speaker A: I would definitely recommend looking for a rental car to have on hand. There is a town within walking distance from me, but it can be dangerous to walk with the wolves and elk around, especially at night. Speaker B: I imagine so!!! I wouldn't want to run into a wolf! Ok. I will add car rental to my plans. Do you get scared with your dogs, that you will run into wildilfe like that? Speaker A: I think I'm more afraid of the wildlife than my dogs are. If I had to, I think I could muster the courage to face the animals out here, but I will happily avoid them when possible. With you around, I'd feel much better, as well. How do you feel about being that close to wildlife?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n2. Speaker A mentioned the wildlife, including elk and wolves.\n3. Speaker A suggests going on hikes in Alaska to see wildlife and mentions glaciers as a potential attraction.\n4. Speaker B is interested in going whale watching and asks about a wolf petting zoo.\n5. Speaker A has invited Speaker B to visit them and is excited about the trip.\n6. Speaker A plans to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information that can help in generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it also contains discrepancies and irrelevant details. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. Helpful Information: \n   - The MEMORY notes that Speaker B is planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in concerts, which is in alignment with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n   - It mentions the presence of wildlife, including elk and wolves, which is relevant to the discussion about needing a rental car and safety concerns.\n\n2. Unhelpful/Irrelevant Information:\n   - The mention of Speaker B being interested in petting a wolf or whale watching is not present in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This information could mislead or confuse when generating a response.\n   - Suggested activities like glacier tours and hikes in Alaska with mentions of glaciers are not aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which hasn't mentioned these activities.\n\n3. General Relevance and Structure:\n   - There is a natural connection demonstrated when it notes Speaker A's invitation and excitement about the visit, and the mention of attending folk concerts aligns with the current topic.\n   - The causality and relevancy are somewhat clouded by the introduction of unrelated activities which were not discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nOverall, while there are relevant details provided in the MEMORY that align with plans and wildlife safety considerations, the introduction of unmentioned activities lowers its helpfulness for generating a coherent next response."
