Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well? Speaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes? Speaker A: I want to take some martial art classes at school next year. What do you sggest I try?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B signed up for classes at the local college and has a background in football and karate.\n2. Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work.\n3. Speaker B attends football games at their old high school and finds that their football background helps in karate footwork.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B both have interests in learning new languages.\n5. Speaker A is taking a French class and plans to learn French to dig for clams in Quebec.\n6. Speaker B enjoys water-related activities and movies like \"Jaws\".\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Considering your interest in martial arts and background in football, I would recommend trying out Taekwondo. It involves a lot of dynamic kicking techniques which might resonate with your football footwork skills. Plus, it's a great way to challenge yourself and learn something new!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some helpful information for Speaker B to generate a response to Speaker A's question about which martial arts to try. Specifically, it provides context on Speaker B's background in karate and sports, which could lend credibility to their suggestions about martial arts. However, the memory also contains some information that isn't directly relevant to the dialogue context, such as interests in languages and water-related activities, which do not contribute to the specific question about martial arts. Additionally, the connections and relevance between some sentences are not entirely clear, which impacts the natural flow and cohesion of the information. Therefore, I would rate its helpfulness in generating a response as a 3."
