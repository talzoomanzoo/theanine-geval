Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you? Speaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has a government job that pays the bills but wishes they could work in interior design.\n2. Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them.\n3. Speaker A also likes mid-century design and is a fan of horror movies.\n4. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\n5. Speaker B has two kids and enjoys painting and taking naps.\n6. Speaker A finds job searching challenging and hopes to settle in the new city soon with a steady income.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear that you're enjoying producing horror movies! It's wonderful to have a creative passion that brings you fulfillment. Maybe you can find a way to incorporate your love for painting into your movie sets or props. It could add a unique touch to your films and combine your talents in a new and exciting way.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains relevant information that connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's involvement in producing horror movies and their perspective on interior design. There is also detail about Speaker B's government job, which could explain the \"day job\" reference. However, the MEMORY has some unrelated or less relevant information, like Speaker A's interest in mid-century design, and Speaker A's job search struggles, which aren't directly connected to the current dialogue. Additionally, MEMORY mentions Speaker B enjoys painting houses but doesn't tie into their thoughts on creative outlets as well as it could. While the MEMORY provides some useful background, it lacks a clear causal connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which limits its helpfulness when generating the next response."
