Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college? Speaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n2. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.\n3. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n4. Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n5. Speaker A is a fan of Arsenal and enjoys watching international teams play.\n6. Speaker A is a college student studying Humanities and wants to finish college before looking for a job.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Goalkeeper is a crucial position, even if it's not the most exciting. It requires a lot of skill and focus. Do you still play soccer occasionally?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains several pieces of information that are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and can help generate a meaningful response. Specifically:\n- It identifies that Speaker B played soccer in college, which connects to the dialogue about Speaker B's role as a goalkeeper.\n- It provides information about Speaker A's soccer involvement and position, which could be used to extend the conversation about soccer experiences and preferences.\n- It mentions Speaker B's fandom of Manchester United, which could relate to discussions about soccer teams, connecting with Speaker A's interest in Arsenal.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides helpful and relevant background that can inform responses in this soccer-related conversation. The information is naturally connected, with soccer being the common theme. However, the direct relevance could be even stronger if it included more direct interactions or past discussions between the speakers, making the context even more tied to generating the immediate next response."
