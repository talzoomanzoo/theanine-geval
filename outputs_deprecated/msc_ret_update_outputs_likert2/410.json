Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far. Speaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes.  Speaker A: why don't you like books like that? Speaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading? Speaker A: Not yet.  I think Netflix is going to make it into a movie soon.  They might finally convince me to pay for a subscription haha. Speaker B: Well if it's any good I know you'll be watching the whole thing. Speaker A: you know it.  And I know that you would just fall asleep during it whether it's any good or not. Speaker B: Is there a lot of violence in your book? I couldn't stand to read it if there was. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n2. Speaker B is fascinated by animals and can relate to Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals.\n3. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n4. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n5. Speaker A suggests taking naps during quiet times and mentions watching her grandkids.\n6. Speaker A was influenced by Alex Trebek and Ken Jennings to develop a love for books and reading.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant context that could be helpful for generating a response in the dialogue. For instance, the information that Speaker A watches Netflix shows and is influenced by figures related to knowledge and reading (Alex Trebek and Ken Jennings) complements their interest in a crime drama and consideration to subscribe to Netflix. \n\nHowever, while it is helpful to know that Speaker B is interested in animals and not much into crime dramas, the connection between this MEMORY and the current conversation could be more direct. Similarly, knowing Speaker A watches shows rated over 3.5 stars can partly explain their interest in the crime drama being good, but it isn't crucial for this context. \n\nThe memories about Speaker A's grandchildren are mentioned in the dialogue, but they do not currently contribute more to the conversation beyond reinforcing Speaker A's day-to-day activities and interests being multifaceted. Therefore, while there are connections to the dialogue, they are not robustly helpful in generating the next response."
