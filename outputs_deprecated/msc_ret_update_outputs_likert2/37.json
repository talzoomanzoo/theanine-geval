Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden. Speaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways? Speaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there? Speaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot.  Speaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n4. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n5. Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n6. Speaker B recommends checking out the volcanoes in Sweden for a unique experience.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides a mixed level of helpfulness for Speaker B to generate a proper next response. Some sentences offer relevant information, such as Speaker A having a cousin in Sweden (Sentence 3) and the context of Speaker A saving money for the trip (Sentence 2). Also, Speaker B's fondness for Sweden and the mention of high expenses (Sentences 4 and 5) provide some context for potential reasons behind Speaker B's inquiry about plans to visit Sweden. However, the MEMORY also contains less relevant information, such as the incorrect detail about traveling together (Sentence 1) and the mention of volcanoes (Sentence 6) which is factually inaccurate. The connections between sentences could be clearer, and the information presented is slightly inconsistent with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Thus, while the MEMORY has some useful parts, it does not fully provide naturally connected and relevant information."
