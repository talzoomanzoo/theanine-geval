Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think? Speaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father.\n2. Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\n3. Speaker A works at a coffee shop and is saving up for their next tattoo.\n4. Speaker B enjoys fishing and wishes their wife and sons could have joined them on the trip.\n5. Speaker A works at a coffee shop that their mom owned.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B have a conversation about their personal interests and trips they have taken for work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's a beautiful idea! Your wife and sons would be touched by such a thoughtful gesture. It's amazing how tattoos can hold so much meaning and tell a story.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information about Speaker A's interest in tattoos, particularly the connections between the tattoo for their late father and their intention to get a new one for their mother. This information is quite helpful to contextualize Speaker A's thought process in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, information such as Speaker A's employment and financial savings for tattoos provides further depth to their character and motivations. \n\nHowever, not all sentences in the MEMORY are directly beneficial for generating a proper next response. For instance, Speaker B's interest in fishing and Speaker A's workplace details may not be directly relevant to the ongoing conversation about tattoos. The connection could be tighter in demonstrating how these points interact with the current dialogue, especially considering that the conversation would likely shift back to tattoos rather than those unrelated topics."
