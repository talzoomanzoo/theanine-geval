Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids? Speaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has grandkids who are more interested in phones and tablets than musical instruments.\n2. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n3. Speaker B mentions having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own.\n4. Speaker A's other children are addicted to tablets and phones, unlike the youngest one who is interested in music.\n5. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n6. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides several pieces of information potentially relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, focusing on Speaker B's relationship with their grandkids and technology. The first sentence is particularly pertinent as it connects with the discussion on technology, expanding on Speaker B's view by highlighting the grandkids' interests. However, some memory sentences (e.g., numbers 2, 3, and 6) provide a broader context regarding Speaker B's activities with their grandkids, without directly linking to the context of using technology for communication. Sentence 4 introduces details about Speaker A's family, which supplements the dialogue with context but is not central. Sentence 5 offers some context on Speaker A's life but lacks direct connection to the ongoing technology conversation. The memory items provide useful background but vary in direct relevance and interconnectedness regarding the ongoing dialogue theme."
