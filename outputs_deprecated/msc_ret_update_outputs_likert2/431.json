Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout.\n2. Speaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat.\n3. Speaker B plans to earn the Eagle Scout badge for college applications.\n4. Speaker B is a member of the boy scouts and works at a fast food place\n5. Speaker B is busy with scouts, school, work, and tennis, but willing to take vacation days for the retreat.\n6. Speaker A is involved in church activities and mentioned a church retreat\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, definitely! Boy Scouts has taught me so much about survival skills and being resourceful in the outdoors. I've had the opportunity to practice setting up shelters, starting fires, and even cooking meals over a campfire. It's been such a rewarding experience.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that can help generate a proper response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It indicates that Speaker B has been involved in Boy Scouts for a long time and is currently a Life Scout, which suggests they have significant experience and knowledge about the survival skills mentioned by Speaker A. This is directly relevant to the skills discussion in the dialogue. Furthermore, Speaker B's aspiration to earn the Eagle Scout badge underlines their commitment and potential depth of knowledge in scouting activities. Additionally, the details about Speaker B's involvement in scouts, school, work, and tennis, along with their willingness to take vacation days for a retreat, provide context about their availability and dedication. However, there are some elements in the memory (such as working at a fast-food place and Speaker A's church involvement) that don't connect directly to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making the memory less focused in parts. Overall, the memory is mostly helpful but could be more tightly connected to the dialogue context for the top score."
