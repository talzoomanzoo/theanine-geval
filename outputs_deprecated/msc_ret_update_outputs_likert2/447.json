Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast. Speaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project. Speaker A: Quite a few, but it wasn't too crowded. It was a nice change of scenery. What kind of project are you working on? Speaker B: I'm sure the student appreciate that. You teach as a group as apposed to one-on-one right? And one of the companies I work for had their system hit with a virus so I've been upgraded their software to debug the system. Speaker A: I teach group classes and one on one, but I was the student today. I specialize in jiu-jitsu but today I got to be the student in a taekwondo class.  Speaker B: That's even better, learning is a life-long journey. How are you class on martial art history? When you have time teach me too, I'd love to learn. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class and enjoys it.\n2. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts.\n3. Both Speaker A and Speaker B are interested in martial arts and enjoy learning new things.\n4. Speaker A is a martial arts teacher and student and is pursuing an athletic training degree in college.\n5. Speaker A is a college student who teaches jiu-jitsu and is lactose intolerant.\n6. Speaker B is busy debugging software and is a runner.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I couldn't agree more, learning never stops. My class on martial art history is going well, and I'd be happy to share some interesting insights with you. It's fascinating to explore the roots of different martial arts and how they've evolved over time. I'll make sure to incorporate some cool facts next time we chat.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information, but not all entries are directly useful or naturally connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, the fact that Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class (point 1) and teaches jiu-jitsu while being a student (point 4) could help develop the conversation about martial arts and teaching. However, Speaker B's involvement in software work and being a runner (points 2 and 6) doesn't directly relate to the ongoing discussion about martial arts classes and learning. The details about Speaker A's lactose intolerance (point 5) are irrelevant in this context. Thus, while some parts of MEMORY provide helpful information, its overall cohesiveness and relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT could be improved."
