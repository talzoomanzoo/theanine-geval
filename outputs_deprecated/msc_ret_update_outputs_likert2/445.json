Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast. Speaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project. Speaker A: Quite a few, but it wasn't too crowded. It was a nice change of scenery. What kind of project are you working on? Speaker B: I'm sure the student appreciate that. You teach as a group as apposed to one-on-one right? And one of the companies I work for had their system hit with a virus so I've been upgraded their software to debug the system.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts.\n2. Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class and enjoys it.\n3. Both Speaker A and Speaker B are interested in martial arts and enjoy learning new things.\n4. Speaker A is a martial arts teacher and student and is pursuing an athletic training degree in college.\n5. Speaker B is busy debugging software and is a runner.\n6. Speaker A is a college student who teaches jiu-jitsu and is lactose intolerant.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Teaching in a group setting can be really rewarding. It sounds like you have your hands full with debugging the software. Hopefully, you can squash those bugs quickly and get everything back on track for the company.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about the interests and activities of Speaker A and Speaker B that could be useful for generating responses in the dialogue context. For example, knowing that Speaker A is a martial arts teacher and student provides depth to their character and informs their responses about their martial arts class. Similarly, understanding that Speaker B is involved in software work and is busy with debugging provides context for their mention of a work project. However, some details, such as Speaker A's lactose intolerance, are not directly relevant to the specific dialogue context and do not contribute to the natural progression of the conversation. Additionally, while both speakers have interests in martial arts, this MEMORY does not clearly demonstrate any substantial development or causality that would enhance the dialogue further. Overall, while there is useful information, the relevance and connection of these details to the dialogue context could be improved for a higher score."
