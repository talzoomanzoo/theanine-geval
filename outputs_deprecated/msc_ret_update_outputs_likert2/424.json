Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing? Speaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel.\n2. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans.\n3. Speaker B prefers animals to humans but acknowledges the importance of curing diseases.\n4. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n5. Speaker A is scared of sharks but finds the idea of going into a steel cage with them interesting.\n6. Speaker B goes to Hawaii for scuba diving and is considering studying marine life or a different type of animal.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information related to past interactions between Speaker A and Speaker B, such as Speaker B having two pet snakes and Speaker B's preference for animals over humans. This supports understanding of the context, like why Speaker B appreciates the low maintenance aspect of their pets. However, several other sentences in the MEMORY (like Speaker A's thoughts about sharks and Speaker A's lab volunteering) do not directly relate to the context of the current conversation, which is specifically about Speaker B's pet snakes. Such details, while informative, don't contribute meaningfully to generating a directly relevant response in the given context, resulting in a moderately helpful score."
