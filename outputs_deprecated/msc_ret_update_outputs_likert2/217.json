    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships! Speaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!   I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field? Speaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate? Speaker B: I have another year- so this year is really important I get internships and start making connections in the field.   I love going to the beach too.  What happened with your knees that now cause you so much pain? Speaker A: I think age has really been my knees downfall. I also used to hike a lot and I put a lot of pressure on my legs. That is great that you only have a year. Maybe when you graduate you can come hang out on the beach with me. I can't surf but I would love to watch you. Speaker B: That would be fun!  I like collecting shells too so we could do that as well.  I have a small collection of ones I have from around the world.  The farthest away was from Greece.  Have you traveled a lot? Speaker A: I have. I love Europe. I have been to many countries there but I have not gone to Greece yet. I would love to. The scenery and architecture is amazing. Have you gotten to visit other European countries? Speaker B: I have.   I have also been to France and Ireland.  Where have you been in Europe? Speaker A: Oh gosh. I have been to France, England, Ireland, Switzerland, Austria, Poland, Germany, Leichenstein, Spain, and much of Mexico, and Bermuda. I just love to travel but I have not been able to recently and with my knees I cannot sit in coach anymore and first class is so expensive. Do you plan on settling any place in particular once you graduate?  Speaker B: That's awesome you have been so many places!   I  am not sure where I will setlle down after graduation.  It probably will depend whether I decide to go further in my education or not and I have any residency requirements with that.   I do like the heat though so  hopefully somewhere sunny! Speaker A: Oh I forgot my most favorite place- Italy. I am sure you will have so many opportunities when you graduate. You will have people knocking down your door. You could go anywhere with that degree. WOuld you like Florida? I personally cannot deal with that much heat but sounds like you would like it there. My brother lives in Cape Coral on one of the canals and he loves it. Other than FLorida what other warm place would you like?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is offering advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field.\n2. Speaker A enjoys hiking along the coast and collecting shells, mentioning that their knees can't handle much else.\n3. Speaker A suggests that surfing could be a way for Speaker B to make connections in the medical field.\n4. Speaker B is interested in sports medicine and enjoys surfing.\n5. Speaker B is looking for internships in the sports medicine field and has asked professors for letters of recommendation.\n6. Speaker B is studying sports medicine and plays soccer, looking to join their college team in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I've always been drawn to California. The weather is perfect for surfing and staying active. Plus, there are so many sports medicine opportunities there with all the professional teams. I can see myself settling down in a coastal town, enjoying the sun and the ocean. Italy sounds amazing too, by the way. The history and culture must be incredible to experience firsthand.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some relevant information that could be helpful for generating a proper next response, but it also includes some inaccuracies and missing details compared to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\nThe MEMORY mentions Speaker A offering advice and encouragement regarding internships and collecting shells, which matches the context where internships in the medical field and shell collecting are discussed. However, it incorrectly suggests that Speaker A mentioned surfing as a way to make connections, and states that Speaker B enjoys surfing, which is not confirmed in the context. Additionally, it introduces elements like Speaker B being interested in sports medicine, playing soccer, and seeking letters of recommendation, which are not mentioned or relevant to the current conversation. \n\nOverall, while the MEMORY has some key elements and connections with the dialogue, it includes irrelevant or incorrect information, which limits its helpfulness in informing a language model's response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
