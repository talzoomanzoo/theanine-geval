Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds exciting! Yes, I've been in touch with my friends, and we're planning to explore different cities in Italy together. It's going to be a fantastic trip filled with history and amazing architecture. Your interest in Greece is inspiring. I hope you get to visit the Greek islands soon and immerse yourself in the mythology you love so much.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe memory provides helpful information for Speaker A, mainly focusing on Speaker B's interest in Greek mythology and Italy, which is relevant to their conversation. It highlights Speaker B's interest in visiting Greece due to its history and mythology, which aligns with the dialogue's current topics. It also mentions Speaker A's interest and plan to visit Italy, which is significant for generating a relevant next response. However, not all sentences are directly related to the current dialogue (e.g., suggesting California as a destination), slightly reducing the overall coherence. Nonetheless, overall, the memory is largely helpful for understanding the ongoing conversation and generating informed responses."
