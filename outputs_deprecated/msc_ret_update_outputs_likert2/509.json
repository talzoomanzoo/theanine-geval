Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well? Speaker B: The older one seems to like it while the youngest cannot be bothered. Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe.\n2. Speaker B's younger son would be jealous of Speaker A's sons' European tour.\n3. Speaker A has two sons who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next.\n4. Speaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite worrying about them traveling far away.\n5. Speaker B is good at ice skating and suggests going to an ice skating rink during winter break.\n6. Speaker B has two sons, one who loves Chinese food like Speaker A, and the other who prefers Italian food.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I wish I could visit them soon, but unfortunately, with work and other responsibilities, it's a bit challenging for me to travel all the way to Europe. I'll just have to enjoy their stories and photos from their adventures abroad for now.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several points that are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and could be helpful for generating a proper next response. Specifically:\n\n1. Memory 1 & 3: Speaker A’s sons are going to Italy next and will be coming for winter break, which aligns with the European context mentioned and allows Speaker A to provide an update or express excitement about seeing their sons.\n2. Memory 4: Since Speaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite worrying about them, this could inform a response about Speaker A's feelings towards the upcoming visit.\n3. Memory 5: Speaker B's suggestion of going to an ice skating rink can be a natural continuation of the conversation centered around their sons’ interests in ice skating.\n4. Memory 6: The mention of Speaker B’s sons and their food preferences does not directly relate to the ice skating or Europe themes in the dialogue context, but it still offers a possible topic for conversation development.\n\nOverall, the information provided in the MEMORY generally aids in developing a relevant next response, though there are parts (like memory 2) that seem less connected to the immediate dialogue topics."
