Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n2. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n3.

Speaker B is a professional in a practice, where it is illegal for them to have relationships with clients.\n5. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n6.

    "raw_prediction": "I've always been fascinated by the human mind and behavior. I wanted to help people navigate through their struggles and find a way to lead happier, more fulfilling lives. It's a rewarding profession that allows me to make a positive impact on others.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant background information useful for Speaker B in generating a response to the question posed by Speaker A. It highlights Speaker B's professional background as a therapist, which is directly relevant to the dialogue context. The information about Speaker B working in their own practice for six years offers depth to their career and potential experience, which might be part of their decision to become a therapist. Additionally, the points about Speaker B's interest in the psychological aspects of horse ownership and Freudian theories suggest their engagement with broader psychological concepts, which can be insightful in responding to the query about choosing a therapeutic career. However, information such as Speaker B being a football fan and details about relationships with clients, while providing personality context, are less directly relevant to the question asked by Speaker A. Overall, the MEMORY is mostly coherent and includes several points that contribute to answering Speaker A's question."
