    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun! Speaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim.  Speaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you  Speaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises. Speaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you? Speaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it. Speaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n2. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n3. Speaker A plans to travel to the Caribbean for their next trip.\n4. Speaker A enjoys the food and the adventure of cruises.\n5. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n6. Speaker A is planning a snorkeling trip and has signed up for several trips.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I've always wanted to explore New Orleans. The music scene there is incredible, and I've heard the food is amazing. It would be a great stop on a cruise trip.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the discussion about going on a cruise ship together (point 1) and Speaker A offering to teach Speaker B how to swim (point 5). These points are in line with the conversation happening in the context. However, other points, like Speaker A enjoying food and adventures on cruises (point 4), are not currently relevant in the dialogue. Furthermore, there is a mismatch because Speaker A offers to help Speaker B in swimming, not programming, which is inaccurately captured in point 5. The connection and causality in the MEMORY could be better structured and more closely aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
