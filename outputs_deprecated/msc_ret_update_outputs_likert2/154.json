Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recommends Speaker A to watch 'Miracle'.\n2. Speaker B's husband enjoys Disney sports movies, such as 'Miracle'.\n3. Speaker B's kids enjoyed watching 'Luca' and said it was good.\n4. Speaker B enjoys watching movies with her kids.\n5. Speaker A also enjoys watching sports movies on Disney.\n6. Speaker B's kids enjoy watching Disney movies, which Speaker B also finds good.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm so glad to hear that you all enjoyed Miracle! It's such an inspiring movie. Have you watched any other Disney sports movies that you liked?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information related to the dialogue context. The key piece relevant to the conversation is memory item 1, where Speaker B recommends \"Miracle\" to Speaker A, which directly connects to the context. Additionally, other items like points 2, 4, and 6 suggest Speaker B's family's enjoyment of Disney movies, which may provide subtle background context that could inform ongoing or future recommendations or discussions about Disney films and family viewing habits.\n\nHowever, other details, such as those related to the movie \"Luca\" (memory item 3) or Speaker A's enjoyment of sports movies on Disney (memory item 5), do not have direct relevance or apparent causality to the coaching or recommendation dynamic presented in the dialogue. The memory could be more effectively structured or curated to better strengthen the direct causality or relevance to the dialogue context, hence the middle-of-the-road score."
