Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work.\n2. Speaker B signed up for classes at the local college and has a background in football and karate.\n3. Speaker B attends football games at their old high school and finds that their football background helps in karate footwork.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B both have interests in learning new languages.\n5. Speaker B enjoys water-related activities and movies like \"Jaws\".\n6. Speaker A is taking a French class and plans to learn French to dig for clams in Quebec.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I've also dabbled in Taekwondo and Jiu-Jitsu before focusing on Karate. It's been a great journey exploring different disciplines.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for Speaker B to generate a proper response to the question asked by Speaker A. Specifically, the MEMORY mentions that Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, which directly relates to martial arts. Additionally, it mentions Speaker B's involvement in football, which is another physical activity but not necessarily a martial art. These pieces of information can help Speaker B in framing a response about their diverse physical activity interests beyond martial arts, although they do not directly answer if other martial arts are practiced. Other memory points, such as language learning or plans for water activities and movies, do not directly contribute to the context about martial arts. Overall, the memory provides some relevant details but lacks a direct connection to multiple martial arts or transitions between activities."
