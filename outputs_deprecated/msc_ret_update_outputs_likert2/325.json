Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume. Speaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully.\n2. Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n3. Speaker A volunteers at a hospital and enjoys making origami crafts, specifically a 3D modular swan with glue.\n4. Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks.\n5. Speaker B is interested in making origami animals and finds the idea cute.\n6. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you so much! I'm really proud of this achievement, and it's great to have something tangible to show for my passion for origami.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful context about Speaker A's interest and skill level in origami, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A is discussing their recent accomplishment in an origami contest. Several sentences describe Speaker A's involvement and enjoyment in origami, including attempting different types and considering teaching others, which directly correlate to their achievement. However, there is slight redundancy in repeating the idea that Speaker A wants to make a lotus origami as it is mentioned twice, which might slightly hinder the cohesion. Nonetheless, the overall MEMORY gives relevant background information that can aid in generating further conversation about origami or Speaker A's interests and activities related to it."
