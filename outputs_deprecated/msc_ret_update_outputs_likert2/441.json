Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it. Speaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it. Speaker A: Cool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot. What is your favorite part about camping? Speaker B: I love being out in the wilderness and sleeping under the stars in the fresh air. It makes you realize how beautiful life is and how small we really are in comparison to the universe. Speaker A: I miss doing that! I have done lots of picnics with my family but it's been a long time since I've slept in a tent! Looking forward to it again when the kids are older. Where was the last place you went? Speaker B: We went up to an island in the middle of nowhere in Canada. There were lots of bears and huge moose! Speaker A: Wow, that sounds like such an adventure! I love to visit Canada. I have seen moose but never a bear! That must have been scary! Speaker B: Yes, it is quite scary. We could also hear the wolves howling at night, luckily we didn't come across them though. One thing to note about bears, is they just want to come and scrounge for our food, so we learned to safely pack it away and hang it up high in a tree. Speaker A: Yes, I've heard that it's important to be careful in bear country! I would love to see one in person though. Do you take lots of photos on your trips? Speaker B: Yes, I took quite a few. The scenery was stunning. Would you like me to send you some photos? I know they are uninteresting to some people. Speaker A: Oh yes, I would love to see some photos! It will be a while before I can take a vacation myself so it's fun to see other people's adventures!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat.\n2. Speaker B is busy with scouts, school, work, and tennis, but willing to take vacation days for the retreat.\n3. Speaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout.\n4. Speaker B has not taken any vacations recently but has vacation days saved up\n5. Speaker A is involved in church activities and mentioned a church retreat\n6. Speaker A wants more children and feels lonely due to their husband's frequent traveling.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'll make sure to send you some photos soon. It's always nice to share the beauty of nature with others, especially when they can't get out there themselves. It's like bringing a piece of the wilderness to you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information about Speaker B's involvement with the Boy Scouts, which complements the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about camping and survival skills learned in scouting. The mention of Speaker B being a Life Scout adds depth to their expertise in the conversation. However, some parts of the MEMORY, such as details about Speaker B's schedule, vacation days, and commitments outside of scouting, like tennis and work, are not directly relevant to generating a response in the given dialogue context. Similarly, Speaker A's church activities and personal feelings about their family situation do not contribute to the continuation of the dialogue about camping and scouts. Thus, while there is relevant information, it is mixed with unrelated details, impacting overall helpfulness."
