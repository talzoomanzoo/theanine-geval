Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods.

Don't go see Black Widow without watching Avengers first. I had an amazing steak and vegetables on the side that were delicious. What is you favorite food?  Speaker B: Oh ok I definitely will watch those first! I love both steak and vegetables! I am a real foodie and love just about everything that isn't too strange to try lol.\n\nMEMORY:\n1.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some information that could potentially be useful to generate responses in a future dialogue. However, most of the points do not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Points 1 and 2 mention Speaker A's and their brother's love for Brazilian food, which is somewhat relevant since Speaker A mentioned having \"Brazilian foods.\" However, the connection to the current conversation about movies and food preferences isn't strongly established. The other points about salsa dancing, Speaker B's interest in healing methods, and their work as a bartender have no clear relevance or causality with the current dialogue about movies and foods, and they don't seem to naturally connect with the ongoing conversation. Therefore, MEMORY doesn't provide a coherent or helpful context for generating a relevant next response in this dialogue."
