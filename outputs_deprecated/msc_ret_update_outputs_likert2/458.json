Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue. Speaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad. Speaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs! Speaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours? Speaker A: Ikea! Their furniture is not to expensive and they have all kinds of furniture that'll go with whatever scheme you're going for. What kind of patio furniture were you looking for? Like a barbeque, chairs, hammock?  Speaker B: I guess I was going to get like an umbrella table and some chairs to go with it or maybe even a screened in gazebo with a fire pit in the middle.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing furniture and home decor choices.\n2. Speaker A is looking to redecorate their house and likes purple furniture.\n3. Speaker A recently bought new furniture for their house, including a couch, recliner, and patio furniture.\n4. Speaker A is looking forward to spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights.\n5. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n6. Speaker B regrets their green and purple color scheme and is willing to give away their purple furniture.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "A screened-in gazebo with a fire pit in the middle sounds like a cozy and inviting setup for your patio! It would be a great addition to your green and purple color scheme dilemma. Ikea has some great options for outdoor furniture that could complement that look. Plus, it'll be perfect for our summer evenings with music, food, and good company.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information regarding the theme of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is about furniture and home decor choices. Statements 1 and 6 are directly relevant as they correspond with Speaker B's current intention to change the green and purple color scheme, and possibly obtain new furniture. Statements 2 and 3 provide additional context, suggesting Speaker A's involvement and interest in furniture and decor, though some details in them (e.g., Speaker A liking purple furniture) conflict with the current dialogue. Statement 5 somewhat connects to the barbecue plan, although it's not directly mentioned which could lead to interpretation issues. However, not all sentences in MEMORY contribute equally, and the connectivity and causality between events are not strongly demonstrated throughout, resulting in a mid-range score."
