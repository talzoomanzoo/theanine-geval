Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far. Speaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n2. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n3. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n4. Speaker A enjoys watching Jeopardy with their grandchildren and cooking for them, with the busiest time being the weekend.\n5. Speaker B is fascinated by animals and can relate to Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals.\n6. Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves by using technology or watching TV.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful background information that connects well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. In the dialogue, Speaker A mentions not watching their grandkids, which ties in with memories like Speaker A being tired after spending time with energetic grandchildren (Memory 1) and Speaker A having grandchildren and watching them (Memory 2). Additionally, Speaker A's interest in stories and media, hinted at in their viewing habits (Memory 3, Memory 4), aligns with the current discussion of a crime drama book they're enjoying. However, not all memories are directly relevant to the present context of the conversation, especially Memory 5 and Memory 6, which involve interests and detail about the grandchildren not directly tied to the current dialogue. These memories could be naturally connected to Speaker B's responses, providing a richer interaction, but they are less directly helpful compared to Memories 1 and 2. Overall, the memories add useful depth to Speaker A's character and their interests, thereby supporting the generation of a coherent response."
