Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me? Speaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week? Speaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A invited Speaker B to visit and mentioned looking into flights.\n2. Speaker A has invited Speaker B to visit them and is excited about the trip.\n3. Speaker A mentioned the warm weather at their location.\n4. Speaker A has visited Alaska and describes it as beautiful, suggesting cheap flights to Anchorage.\n5. Speaker A plans to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit.\n6. Speaker B is planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides several helpful pieces of information for a language model representing Speaker B to generate a relevant next response. Sentences 1, 2, and 6 directly connect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT by elaborating on the invitation and excitement about the visit, as well as the activities planned, which aligns with the current conversation about the trip. Sentence 3 is relevant as it discusses the weather, which is directly mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 4 and 5 provide context about Speaker A's past experiences and plans, contributing to the overall relational development between the speakers and aiding in generating a natural continuation of the dialogue. However, some sentences, like sentence 4, might not be immediately relevant to the specific conversation at hand, causing a slight drop from a perfect score."
