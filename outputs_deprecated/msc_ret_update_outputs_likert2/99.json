Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet.\n2. Speaker B is unsure about what else there is to do in Alaska besides hiking.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together.\n4. Speaker A mentions the outdoor activities they plan to do in Alaska, such as hiking.\n5. Speaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking.\n6. Speaker A has the impression that Alaska is cold and snowy, wondering if there are ski slopes there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation and is unsure about activities besides hiking, which directly relates to Speaker A's inquiry about ideas for the trip. Additionally, it indicates that Speaker A is familiar with outdoor activities in Alaska, such as hiking and fishing, and wonders about the presence of ski slopes. While most sentences are helpful, sentence 3 appears slightly less relevant because it suggests both speakers are planning the trip together, which does not directly align with the context provided. Overall, the MEMORY is structured in a coherent way, demonstrating relevance to the topic, but could be slightly improved by ensuring all points are directly related to guiding Speaker B in their trip planning."
