Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college? Speaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position.  Speaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it? Speaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days.  Speaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living. Speaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime? Speaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play. Speaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with. Speaker A: Sounds great! Now the tough question: when do you have time? Speaker B: It would have to be sometime when I'm off work, maybe on the weekend. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n2. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.\n3. Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n4. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n5. Speaker A is a fan of Arsenal and enjoys watching international teams play.\n6. Speaker A is a college student studying Humanities and wants to finish college before looking for a job.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker A and Speaker B that could help in generating a response within the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, knowing that Speaker B played soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United adds depth to their character and relates to the ongoing conversation about soccer. Similarly, Speaker Aâ€™s interest in soccer and their aspirations to be a voice on soccer video games is somewhat corroborated by the MEMORY indicating they are engaged in soccer tournaments and enjoy scoring goals. However, some pieces of information, such as Speaker A's college major, do not directly contribute to the current dialogue about playing soccer together. While the MEMORY contains useful snippets, it lacks some causality or direct connection to prompt a seamless continuation of the conversation, which prevents it from achieving a higher score."
