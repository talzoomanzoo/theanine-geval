Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends? Speaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is unsure about what else there is to do in Alaska besides hiking.\n2. Speaker A mentions the outdoor activities they plan to do in Alaska, such as hiking.\n3. Speaker A has the impression that Alaska is cold and snowy, wondering if there are ski slopes there.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together.\n5. Speaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet.\n6. Speaker A mentions that Alaska has mountains and glaciers, unsure if skiing is possible there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a fantastic idea! Dog sledding is a popular activity in Alaska, especially during the winter months when there's snow on the ground. And your friend is right, Alaska experiences long daylight hours in the summer due to its northern location, so you'll have plenty of time to enjoy all the outdoor adventures during your trip.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains useful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as details about Speaker B's uncertainty regarding activities in Alaska and Speaker A's knowledge about the region's geography. However, the connections between sentences are not very clear, and there is a lack of direct relevance to the current conversation about dog sledding and daylight/darkness conditions in Alaska. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it provided clearer causality or relevance to the specific concerns Speaker B has in the dialogue context."
