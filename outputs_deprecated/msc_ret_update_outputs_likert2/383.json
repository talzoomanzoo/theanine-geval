Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think? Speaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons Speaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use. Speaker B: I am a little scared of needles though. Were your tattoos painful? Speaker A: Most of them were not.  It really depends on where on your body you get them.  Most of mine are on areas that didn't hurt.  The one on my foot and the one behind my ear did hurt a good bit.  Where were you thinking about getting it?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father.\n2. Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\n3. Speaker A works at a coffee shop and is saving up for their next tattoo.\n4. Speaker A works at a coffee shop that their mom owned.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B have a conversation about their personal interests and trips they have taken for work.\n6. Speaker B enjoys fishing and wishes their wife and sons could have joined them on the trip.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I was thinking of getting it on my forearm. I've heard that area isn't too painful for tattoos. Maybe I'll gather my courage and finally get one to honor my family.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information about Speaker A's tattoos and their connection to their parents, which is potentially helpful given the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT discussing getting a tattoo for Speaker A's mom. However, the MEMORY does not offer much information about Speaker B's thoughts or past conversations that would aid in formulating a response for Speaker B in this context. Moreover, the information about Speaker B's personal interests such as fishing is not directly connected to the tattoo discussion, making it less pertinent for generating a relevant response. Additionally, the sentences in the MEMORY do not demonstrate a clear causality or relevancy to the ongoing conversation, indicating a lack of natural connection between events. Thus, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful but not optimally structured for this specific context."
