Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue. Speaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad. Speaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs! Speaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours? Speaker A: Ikea! Their furniture is not to expensive and they have all kinds of furniture that'll go with whatever scheme you're going for. What kind of patio furniture were you looking for? Like a barbeque, chairs, hammock? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is looking to redecorate their house and likes purple furniture.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing furniture and home decor choices.\n3. Speaker B regrets their green and purple color scheme and is willing to give away their purple furniture.\n4. Speaker A recently bought new furniture for their house, including a couch, recliner, and patio furniture.\n5. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n6. Speaker A is looking forward to spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains some relevant information, but it lacks clarity and relevancy in connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1, 4, and 5 include details that are not present or clearly linked to the dialogue (like Speaker A buying furniture or inviting Speaker B over). Sentence 6 suggests anticipation for summer evenings, which could tie into the conversation about a barbecue but is not directly addressed in the context. Sentence 3 conveys that Speaker B regrets their green and purple scheme, which is partially relevant since Speaker B mentions dissatisfaction with their current color scheme in the context. While Sentence 2 states that furniture and home decor are being discussed, it doesn't add new information. Overall, the MEMORY lacks natural flow and detailed connections needed to be highly helpful."
