    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place? Speaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping? Speaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp? Speaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B expresses concern about leaving a kitten alone during their family camping adventures.\n2. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n3. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n4. Speaker B is away from their child and glad that the pets are with them.\n5. Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys.\n6. Speaker A is offering advice and seems to have experience with children.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I prefer tent camping for the authentic outdoor experience. It's great to disconnect from technology and enjoy nature. Do you have any favorite camping activities you like to do with your daughter?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some related information for context, such as Speaker B's role as a parent and their concern for pets during camping (1, 4). Although not directly connected to the current dialogue about camping locations, it gives insights into Speaker B's responsibilities and potential constraints during camping trips, which is somewhat relevant. The information about Speaker A's frequent visits to the zoo (3, 5) and their experience with children (6) could provide useful context in future conversations. Overall, while there are elements that could be relevant, the lack of direct connection and causality between sentences means it may not be entirely helpful for generating a next response in the given dialogue context."
