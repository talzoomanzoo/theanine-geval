Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden. Speaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways? Speaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n4. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n5. Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n6. Speaker B's parents still live in Sweden, and they find it expensive to travel there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful background regarding Speaker A's and Speaker B's connections to Sweden. For example, it establishes that Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden and is in the planning stages of a trip, which relates closely to the dialogue context. Additionally, it mentions that Speaker B has fond memories of Sweden, which can explain a possible motivation for their interest in Speaker A's trip. However, the memory's relevance could be stronger. It contains information about Speaker A and Speaker B planning to travel together, which is not mentioned in the dialogue context. Additionally, the information about Speaker B's parents living in Sweden does not directly contribute to the immediate conversation, making it less helpful for generating the next response. Overall, the memory is moderately helpful but could be refined for stronger relevance and connection to the dialogue context."
