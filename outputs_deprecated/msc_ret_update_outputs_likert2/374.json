Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens? Speaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month Speaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.  Where are you going on vacation? Speaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there! Speaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo? Speaker B: Their zoo is pretty good! It's always crowded, of course, but they have pandas so I'm happy. I would say it's bigger than the DC zoo, but I like that the DC zoo has fewer people. Speaker A: That sounds awesome.  I haven't been to the zoo in so long.  I wish I could go.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo.\n2. Speaker A enjoys seeing pandas and penguins at the zoo and goes with their sister.\n3. Speaker A has been to the zoo before and enjoys seeing exotic birds.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss hobbies and interests, with Speaker A enjoying gardening and reading, and Speaker B enjoying visiting the zoo.\n5. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend.\n6. Speaker B likes poetry and fantasy books, and has a pet cat.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for generating a next response in the dialogue context. Notably:\n\n- Sentence 5 indicates Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend, which directly relates to the question Speaker A asks in the context.\n- Sentence 6 touches on Speaker B's interests and pet ownership, which is somewhat relevant as it might inform a general conversation about their future plans, including pet care when adopting a kitten.\n\nHowever, several sentences in MEMORY mention topics (e.g., hobbies, likes/dislikes at the zoo, types of zoo animals) not directly affecting the immediate flow or focus of the dialogue context, which centers on Speaker B's trip to San Diego and considerations about adopting a kitten.\n\nThe connection between these points and the causality is a bit loose, and many sentences don't build upon each other in a way that strongly supports generating responses that tie back into the ongoing conversation about the specific zoo trip or the discussion on the adoption timeline decision. The natural progression and relevance of past interactions aren't fully captured in this MEMORY, diluting its helpfulness."
