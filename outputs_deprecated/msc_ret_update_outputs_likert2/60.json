Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like. Speaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk? Speaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous. Speaker B: That sounds amazing! Did you bring a pet? I love doing the harder trails with my dog. Sometimes, it's very peaceful to get away from everything. Speaker A: No, I don't have any pets; my apartment seems too small for a dog and I would worry about them being lonely all day when I'm at work. I was thinking about getting a pair of cats, but I haven't committed yet. How nice fo ryou to have company when you're walking though! What kind of dog do you have? Speaker B: Cats can be nice! I used to have cats, but am allergic to them and had to give them to my friend. I have an Australian Kelpie who is a rescue. She is very energetic and smart!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B lives in the country, loves nature, and works with animals.\n2. Speaker A is a city dweller who walks to work instead of driving.\n3. Speaker B enjoys reading the Odd Thomas and Dark Tower series and finds inspiration for their artwork during nature walks.\n4. Speaker A asks about Speaker B's new artwork and acknowledges their need for inspiration.\n5. Speaker A also enjoyed reading 'Redwall' growing up and keeps an eye out for similar books.\n6. Speaker B gets along somewhat with their sister.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some pieces of information that might be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's love for nature and potentially their inspiration during nature walks. However, many aspects of the MEMORY details are disconnected from the current dialogue. Details like Speaker B's taste in books, their relationship with their sister, and Speaker A's preference for walking or reading habits have little relevance to the ongoing conversation about the nature walk and pets. Moreover, there are sentences in the MEMORY that do not demonstrate clear causality or relevance to the dialogue, such as Speaker A walking to work. Hence, the MEMORY wouldn't greatly assist in generating a proper next response in this specific context."
