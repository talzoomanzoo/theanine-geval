Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself! Speaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid.\n2. Speaker A's friend found two baby raccoons in her yard, one of which was given to Speaker A to keep as a pet.\n3. Speaker A is not interested in going on a cruise and would prefer camping as a vacation.\n4. Speaker A does not play music for the animals at the zoo to keep them calm.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B share a love for music and plan to have a house concert with their pets.\n6. Speaker B asks Speaker A if they have had a pet raccoon before.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that can be helpful for generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The fact that Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey is directly relevant because the conversation is about Journey eating pizza. This helps in building an understanding of Journey as a pet, which is pertinent to continuing the discussion about how to manage or train Journey not to eat food. \n\nHowever, other pieces of information, such as Speaker A's vacation preferences or details about a house concert with pets, seem extraneous to the immediate context and don't contribute to understanding the situation with Journey and the pizza. There is a lack of natural connection or causality between some of the memory entries, making it less coherent in terms of assisting with the current dialogue context. \n\nThus, MEMORY has some helpful elements but also contains irrelevant information, which affects its overall helpfulness score."
