Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens? Speaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month Speaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.  Where are you going on vacation? Speaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there! Speaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo? Speaker B: Their zoo is pretty good! It's always crowded, of course, but they have pandas so I'm happy. I would say it's bigger than the DC zoo, but I like that the DC zoo has fewer people.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo.\n2. Speaker A enjoys seeing pandas and penguins at the zoo and goes with their sister.\n3. Speaker A has been to the zoo before and enjoys seeing exotic birds.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss hobbies and interests, with Speaker A enjoying gardening and reading, and Speaker B enjoying visiting the zoo.\n5. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend.\n6. Speaker B likes poetry and fantasy books, and has a pet cat.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great trip! Pandas are always a highlight at any zoo. I hope you have a fantastic time in San Diego and enjoy all the different animals they have there.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be helpful in generating a proper next response for Speaker A. Specifically, it notes that Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend (matching the beginning of the dialogue) and that Speaker B enjoys visiting the zoo (which is relevant to their upcoming trip to San Diego and the planned visit to the zoo there). However, the memory contains several unrelated details about their past interests and hobbies, such as Speaker A's enjoyment of gardening, reading, and exotic birds, as well as Speaker B's liking for poetry and fantasy books, which do not directly contribute to the development of the current conversation. Furthermore, the nature of their past interactions is not deeply explored, and connectivity and causality between memory elements and the dialogue context could be more explicit."
