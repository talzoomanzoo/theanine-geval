Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job! Speaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. Speaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?   Speaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone. Speaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you? Speaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know. Speaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient! \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n2. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n3. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n4. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n5. Speaker A is married and has been for four years.\n6. Speaker B lives in the city and is interested in having a horse in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I had no idea therapy could be completed in just a few sessions. I guess it really does depend on the individual and their needs.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains certain pieces of information that are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, the fact that Speaker B is a therapist (Memory 1 and 4) aligns with the conversation about becoming and enjoying working as a therapist mentioned in the dialogue. Speaker A's interest and knowledge about horses are also noted in both the context and memory (Memory 3). However, most sentences in the memory don't directly contribute to generating the next response about therapy or fields related to it. For instance, Speaker B's support for the Chiefs, consideration of the psychological aspects of owning a horse, and future interest in having a horse, while somewhat related, do not build direct causality or relevancy with the ongoing conversation about therapy in a straightforward or helpful way. Moreover, Speaker A's marital status or Speaker B living in the city, while providing some context about the speakers, does not add direct value to the continuation of the dialogue about therapy. Overall, while there are some relevant points, the memory lacks fluid connection and significant information to foster the dialogue context effectively."
