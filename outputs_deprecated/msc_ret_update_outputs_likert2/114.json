Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok?  Speaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish? Speaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus! Speaker B: Oh that sounds absolutely fabulous. Are you going to get a free dessert, as well? Speaker A: Yes, I am thinking about trying either the new eclairs, or their tres leches cake with fresh raspberry jam sauce and lemon drizzle! I have too many good options to pick from! What one would you pick?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n2. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n3. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n4. Speaker B loves the beach and Mediterranean food.\n5. Speaker A's restaurant plays a mix of songs, mainly easy listening, to create a relaxing environment for diners.\n6. Speaker A's schedule at the restaurant includes working doubles on Saturdays and 8-hour shifts on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Both options sound delicious, but I think I would go for the tres leches cake with fresh raspberry jam sauce and lemon drizzle. It sounds like the perfect combination of sweet and tangy flavors. Enjoy your meal!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides details about Speaker A's job at a restaurant, such as receiving free meals, which is relevant given the conversation focuses on a dish at work. It also notes Speaker A's busy work environment and schedule. However, the information doesn’t directly connect with the specific excitement or menu items Speaker A mentions in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences about Speaker A's work schedule and the restaurant's ambiance do not directly contribute to anticipating the next response. Additionally, Speaker B's preference for Mediterranean food and the fact that they love the beach are not relevant to the context. The MEMORY would be more helpful if it included information directly related to the specific dishes or A’s excitement about restaurant perks. Overall, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful but lacks a strong direct connection to the specific details of the dialogue."
