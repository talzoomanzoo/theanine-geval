Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2.

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad you enjoyed the movie and the Brazilian food! My favorite food is sushi, I could eat it every day. It's great that you had an amazing steak, Brazilian steakhouses are known for their delicious meats.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some details about Speaker A and B, such as their interest in Brazilian steakhouse, salsa dancing, and Speaker B's job as a bartender. However, these details are not directly connected to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on the movie Black Widow and the Brazilian foods enjoyed during the movie. The MEMORY does not provide specific information that would help Speaker B generate a relevant response in the current conversation about movies and food. Additionally, the memories about salsa dancing or other activities are not naturally connected to the conversation at hand. Thus, the MEMORY lacks relevance and provides limited helpfulness in generating a proper next response."
