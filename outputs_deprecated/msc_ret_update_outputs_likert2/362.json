    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week? Speaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you? Speaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions? Speaker B: Unfortunately I mainly play games similar to RE. I don't know why I like them so much. I remember when I was little my brother play Doom and it gave me nightmares for a week. What genre of games you like? Speaker A: I like all kinds of games. I like party, fighting, RPGs, shooters, action, adventure, and puzzle games. I enjoy playing Jurassic Park: World but I'd like to find another game to play. The storm means I'll be inside for a bit, so I think I'll curl up with some pizza and just zone out. Do you like to do anything else besides game when it's rainy? Speaker B: Well, I might help around the house with cleaning or laundry, but not that much. Mostly gaming. If I feel I sat too long, I'll switch to Nintendo Switch's Ring Fit Adventure to get my body moving a bit. Do yo know that game?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n2. Speaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII.\n3. Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World.\n4. Speaker B mentions that Resident Evil can be scary and provides some tips for playing it.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy playing video games in their free time.\n6. Speaker A prefers tamer video games and is not a fan of horror movies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I've heard of Ring Fit Adventure, it's a great way to stay active while gaming. I might give it a try sometime. I usually just stick to playing games on my console or PC, but it's good to have some variety. I might look into some new games to try out soon.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically about the gaming preferences of Speaker A and Speaker B. However, the connections and relevance between different points in MEMORY could be clearer. For instance, MEMORY points such as 1 and 4 mention Resident Evil but do not develop a connection or continuity with the contextual discussion of different games and activities during rainy weather. MEMORY points 2 and 6 add details about the games each speaker prefers, which may be somewhat useful, but there isn't a strong coherence or direct relevancy to the conversation about rainy day activities beyond gaming. The MEMORY could be improved by better connecting these statements and aligning them with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as more details about their past interactions or how their preferences were explored or changed. Overall, MEMORY provides some relevant insights but lacks natural structure and deeper interrelations to score higher than a 3."
