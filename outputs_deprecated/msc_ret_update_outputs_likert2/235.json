Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet?  Speaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name? Speaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended.  Speaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along! Speaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them. Speaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me! Speaker A: Hahaha. Yes I agree its too hot to get a long hike in. I've been on some short ones, but the bugs eat me alive. I like to hike in the fall when the bugs are dying off and its a little cooler.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n2. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n3. Speaker A is interested in training tips for the kittens and is open to adopting one despite having a parrot.\n4. Speaker A's parrot Tasha has seen cats before and ignores them.\n5. Speaker B lives in the city they grew up in, loves animals, and has a cat that recently had a kitten.\n6. Speaker B has an older mellow cat and is concerned about training the new energetic kittens.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I totally get that! Fall is the perfect time for hiking - cool weather and no bugs to bother you. I can't wait for the season to change so I can hit the trails without feeling like a snack for mosquitoes.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, it is not optimally organized or entirely relevant for generating a natural next response. Points 1 and 2 repeat similar information and do not enhance the context significantly. Point 5 provides information about Speaker B's affinity towards animals, but it does not directly relate to the context about hiking. Point 6 offers insights into Speaker B's feelings towards the new kittens which could be relevant, but it lacks connection to the current conversation topic around hiking and weather. The connection between past interactions and the current conversation is not strongly demonstrated, leading to a moderately helpful score."
