    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you? Speaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses. Speaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set? Speaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\n2. Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them.\n3. Speaker A also likes mid-century design and is a fan of horror movies.\n4. Speaker A prefers classic horror movies like Halloween or Friday the 13th over modern ones.\n5. Speaker B has a government job that pays the bills but wishes they could work in interior design.\n6. Speaker A has recently received a call for a job interview and is excited about it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information but also includes pieces that are either incorrect or not directly useful for generating a next response in the context of the current dialogue. \n\n1. The entry, \"Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations,\" is relevant as it relates to Speaker B's involvement in horror movies, which is a topic being discussed.\n\n2. The entry, \"Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them,\" is partially correct as it was Speaker B who is producing horror movies, not Speaker A. This could lead to confusion or irrelevance when generating a response.\n\n3. The part about Speaker A liking mid-century design and being a fan of horror movies adds to the context of their interest but isn't directly useful for advancing the current dialogue which is focused more on Speaker B's experiences.\n\n4. Preferences for classic horror movies could be useful in some situations but are not directly related to the current line of questioning about interesting stories from sets, so its relevance is limited.\n\n5. Speaker B working a government job but wishing they could work in interior design is partially helpful, as it contrasts with their enjoyment of producing horror movies, but interior design was mentioned unfavorably by Speaker B in the context given.\n\n6. The last point about Speaker Aâ€™s job interview excitement is unrelatedly injected here and not useful for the current conversation about horror movies.\n\nThus, there is a mix of correct and somewhat related information alongside irrelevant or incorrect details, positioning the helpfulness of the MEMORY at a moderate level."
