Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet?  Speaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name? Speaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended.  Speaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along! Speaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them. Speaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me! Speaker A: Hahaha. Yes I agree its too hot to get a long hike in. I've been on some short ones, but the bugs eat me alive. I like to hike in the fall when the bugs are dying off and its a little cooler. Speaker B: Ah yes, that's my favorite time of year. Oh and speaking of Tasha, I'm still amazed she knows Mandarin. Have you been learning more of the language?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n2. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n3. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n4. Speaker A's parrot Tasha has seen cats before and ignores them.\n5. Speaker A is interested in training tips for the kittens and is open to adopting one despite having a parrot.\n6. Speaker A suggested the name Zhao for one of the kittens.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I haven't been actively learning more Mandarin, but I try to incorporate a few new phrases now and then. Tasha's quite the polyglot! I think I'll stick to the basics for now though.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some limited helpful information but lacks a clear connection and natural flow to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Points 1 and 4 are the most relevant as they mention Speaker A's parrot, Tasha, and adopting a rescue kitten, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, points 2, 3, and 5 contain redundant information and do not align well with the specific aspect of adopting and naming kittens discussed in the context. Point 6 is relevant to the context's focus on naming, but the mention of \"Zhao\" is inconsistent with the current dialogue's black and white theme for a name (\"Oreo\"). Sentences in the MEMORY do not provide causal or sequential connections to the conversation, limiting its helpfulness in generating a response."
