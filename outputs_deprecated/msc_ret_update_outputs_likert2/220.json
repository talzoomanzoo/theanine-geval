Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself! Speaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food? Speaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid.\n2. Speaker A mentions having dogs and Speaker B admires them for their peaceful nature.\n3. Speaker B has two terrier dogs as pets.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B share a love for music and plan to have a house concert with their pets.\n5. Speaker B asks Speaker A if they have had a pet raccoon before.\n6. Speaker A has a pet raccoon and has a friend who found baby raccoons.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some background information about the pets owned by Speaker A and Speaker B, which could help in crafting a response related to pets and the challenges of keeping food away from them. The fact that Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey is relevant because it clarifies that Journey is not a dog, as the DIALOGUE CONTEXT suggests, and helps to understand the context about Journey getting into the food. However, many sentences in MEMORY do not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT or provide necessary causality or continuity (e.g., points about the terrier dogs, shared love for music, or house concert plans) and thus do not significantly aid in generating the next response. The MEMORY lacks cohesiveness and sufficient detail about past interactions that directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
