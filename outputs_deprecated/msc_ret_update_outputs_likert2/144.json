Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place? Speaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n2. Speaker B expresses concern about leaving a kitten alone during their family camping adventures.\n3. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n4. Speaker B is away from their child and glad that the pets are with them.\n5. Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys.\n6. Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe provided MEMORY contains some relevant details that could potentially be useful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is not particularly well-organized or clearly connected to the ongoing conversation. Here’s why the score is 2:\n\n1. Relevant information present: There is some relevant mention of Speaker B's child wanting to visit the zoo (MEMORY 6), which ties into the theme of children enjoying outings, similar to the trip mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n2. Disconnected and fragmented: The details regarding Speaker B’s concern about a kitten (MEMORY 2) and Speaker A’s zoo visits (MEMORY 5) are mostly unrelated to the context of camping, which is what Speaker A seems to be interested in. There’s a lack of clear causality or sequence connecting these pieces of information.\n\n3. Lack of coherence: The MEMORY does not provide a coherent snapshot of past interactions that would help Speaker A generate a follow-up question about camping or make it clear why these memories are being referenced in the conversation about a weekend trip.\n\n4. While the MEMORY does provide some insights into Speaker B's and A's interests and lifestyles, it fails to make a strong connection or demonstrate relevancy to the current conversation centered around camping. Thus, it offers limited help for follow-up dialogue generation."
