Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n2. Speaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII.\n3. Speaker B mentions that Resident Evil can be scary and provides some tips for playing it.\n4. Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World.\n5. Speaker A prefers tamer video games and is not a fan of horror movies.\n6. Speaker B is interested in playing Jurassic Park: World but has not played it yet.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, I did! I actually started playing Resident Evil VIII, and it's been quite the thrilling experience. The atmosphere can get pretty intense, but it's also so exciting to explore the game world and uncover the story. If you ever decide to give it a try, just remember to take it slow and conserve your resources. It can be quite challenging, but that's part of the fun!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides highly relevant and connected information that would help a language model generate a proper response. It mentions that Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys a different game, Jurassic Park: World, which could be relevant to the current question. Additionally, it includes information about Speaker B's interest in Resident Evil and video games in general, adding context to Speaker Aâ€™s inquiry. Overall, the MEMORY is structured in a way that demonstrates clear causality and relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
