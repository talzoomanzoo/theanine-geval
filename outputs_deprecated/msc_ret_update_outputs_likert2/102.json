Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends? Speaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do. Speaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars. Speaker B: Yeah, I think they go dark for a couple months and then have daylight for a couple months! I actually like night time, but having daylight all the time will make me crazy lol. Yeah I kind of hope it's dark for the camping but it will be very cold. I have heard Alaska has delicious ice cream. I want to try that while I'm there, \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mentions the outdoor activities they plan to do in Alaska, such as hiking.\n2. Speaker A has the impression that Alaska is cold and snowy, wondering if there are ski slopes there.\n3. Speaker B is unsure about what else there is to do in Alaska besides hiking.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together.\n5. Speaker A mentions that Alaska has mountains and glaciers, unsure if skiing is possible there.\n6. Speaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's interesting about the daylight cycles in Alaska! Camping under the stars during the dark months sounds like a unique experience. And yes, trying some delicious Alaskan ice cream sounds like a must-do on the trip. I'm sure we'll find plenty of fun activities to keep us busy while we're there.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some contextual information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B planning an Alaskan vacation, which aligns with their ongoing conversation about the trip in the dialogue. It also highlights the uncertainty and curiosity about outdoor activities and the weather in Alaska, which Speaker B is discussing in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT (e.g., sledding with dogs, daylight/darkness). However, the MEMORY lacks some specificity and causality. For example, while the MEMORY talks about New Zealand being cold and potentially having skiing, it doesn't directly tie into the current conversation about sledding or stargazing at night. Further connections or causality between the sentences could have made it more helpful."
