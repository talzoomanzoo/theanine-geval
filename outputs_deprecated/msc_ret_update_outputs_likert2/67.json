Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play?  Speaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is in a band and plays music, possibly a musician.\n2. Speaker A is in a band where they play the drums and write music, with 4 members including the singer who is their best friend.\n3. Speaker A is part of a band that tours different countries for their music.\n4. Speaker A wants to see Sublime live one day but doesn't go to many concerts other than the ones their band plays in.\n5. Speaker B listens to Sublime a lot while relaxing on the beach.\n6. Speaker A enjoys eating fish, particularly salmon or tuna.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's cool! Rock music is great for just listening and enjoying. Do you have a favorite rock band or artist?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response by establishing a clear profile of Speaker A as a musician who is involved with a band, plays the drums, and has a best friend who is the singer in the band. This connection to music is directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Speaker A asks if Speaker B plays an instrument. The memory also connects Speaker A's interest in music to specific details, such as their desire to see Sublime live and their band's touring activities. It even ties into Speaker B's music preference with mention of Sublime. However, not all memories are directly useful or closely connected to the dialogue, such as information about Speaker A's food preferences, which slightly affects the overall score."
