Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well? Speaker B: I haven't!

    "raw_prediction": "Sounds perfect! I'll see you tomorrow afternoon between 3-6 at the dojo. Can't wait to try out some karate moves!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful context for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, knowing that Speaker B has a background in karate and football, practices karate, and has a green belt (Memory 1 and 2) is relevant, as it aligns with the current discussion about martial arts. These details present Speaker B as knowledgeable and may influence Speaker A's decision to try out karate. However, some details such as Speaker B's interests in water-related activities, movies like \"Jaws\", and language learning (Memory 4 and 5), along with Speaker A's interest in French (Memory 6), are less relevant to the immediate context of discussing martial arts classes and setting up a dojo visit. The MEMORY is moderately connected and relevant, hence the score of 3."
