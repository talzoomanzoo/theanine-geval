Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play?  Speaker B: I don't know play instrument.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some information about Speaker A being a musician, specifically a drummer in a band, which slightly aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A mentions they have been playing drums since they were a kid. However, the rest of the MEMORY does not provide direct or relevant information about the current conversation about rock music or favorite bands. Most details, such as Speaker A's interest in seeing Sublime live, being good at surfing, or Speaker B willing to teach fishing, do not connect with the context of discussing rock music or comparing musical experiences between Speakers A and B. Therefore, the MEMORY is not very helpful in generating a suitable next response for the ongoing dialogue."
