Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play?  Speaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music. Speaker A: ah right, who's your favourite rock band? Speaker B: I'm big fan of aerosmith. When do you learn music. Whom teach you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is in a band and plays music, possibly a musician.\n2. Speaker B is willing to teach Speaker A how to fish and cook.\n3. Speaker A is in a band where they play the drums and write music, with 4 members including the singer who is their best friend.\n4. Speaker A is part of a band that tours different countries for their music.\n5. Speaker A wants to see Sublime live one day but doesn't go to many concerts other than the ones their band plays in.\n6. Speaker B listens to Sublime a lot while relaxing on the beach.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I learned to play the drums when I was in high school, and then I started writing music with my bandmates. Our singer, who is also my best friend, taught me a lot about songwriting.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, indicating that Speaker A is in a band, plays music, and is a musician. This is helpful for generating a response related to music, as it provides context for Speaker A's connection to music and playing instruments. However, the MEMORY also includes details that are less relevant to the current context, such as Speaker B's willingness to teach Speaker A how to fish and cook, or Speaker A's preference for Sublime and their concert-going habits. These details don't directly contribute to the dialogue at hand about rock music and favorite bands. Additionally, the MEMORY lacks a strong structure that clearly connects or demonstrates causality between the stated points. Overall, while some details are helpful, the MEMORY could be more focused and cohesive to better serve the dialogue context."
