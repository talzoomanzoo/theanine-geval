Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods. Speaker B: Oh that sounds fun! What is it about?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and their brother enjoy going to a Brazilian steakhouse for dinner.\n2.

    "raw_prediction": "It's an action-packed movie about the Marvel character Black Widow. We loved the mix of adrenaline and great storytelling.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains individual facts that may provide some background on the speakers' interests, such as Speaker A's enjoyment of Brazilian food and salsa dancing, and Speaker B's job as a bartender. However, the information does not directly relate to the dialogue context about watching the \"Black Widow\" movie. The MEMORY lacks clear connections or causality that would be helpful for Speaker A to generate a relevant response to Speaker B's question about the movie's plot. Additionally, most memories are unrelated to each other, offering little continuity or development necessary for creating a coherent and contextually appropriate continuation."
