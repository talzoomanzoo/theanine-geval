Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it!

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response within the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but there are areas where it could be improved. The memory includes information about Speaker A's interest in movies and reliance on Speaker B for recommendations, which is relevant given the context in which they discuss movie recommendations. It also mentions Speaker B's knowledge and enjoyment of a wide range of film genres, which could inform Speaker B's response about movie preferences or suggestions.\n\nHowever, not all entries in the MEMORY are directly relevant to the specific dialogue. For example, the mention of Uma Thurman does not directly contribute to generating a response for the context provided. Additionally, the MEMORY mentions that Speaker A expressed interest in the \"Coming to America\" sequel, which is not consistent with the current context as it was not mentioned; this could lead to confusion in generating a response. Lastly, the connection between memory points is somewhat fragmented, lacking clear development of past interactions that could enhance the dialogue's relevance and natural flow. Therefore, while some entries are helpful, the overall structure and relevance could be improved for a higher score."
