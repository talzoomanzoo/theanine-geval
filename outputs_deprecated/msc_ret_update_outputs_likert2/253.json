Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you? Speaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses. Speaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\n2. Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them.\n3. Speaker A also likes mid-century design and is a fan of horror movies.\n4. Speaker B has a government job that pays the bills but wishes they could work in interior design.\n5. Speaker A prefers classic horror movies like Halloween or Friday the 13th over modern ones.\n6. Speaker A has recently received a call for a job interview and is excited about it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some information that could be relevant, such as Speaker B creating horror movies with their dad and having a government job. However, it includes inaccuracies, like indicating Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies, which contradicts Speaker B's statement in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, some information, such as Speaker A's preference for classic horror movies and their excitement about a job interview, do not have a clear connection to the conversation. The overall coherence and relevancy regarding Speaker B's response in the context are weak, resulting in a low helpfulness score."
