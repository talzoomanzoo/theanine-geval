Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on! Speaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes.\n2. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n3. Speaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners.\n4. Speaker B does not do a lot of cooking or baking but is interested in learning.\n5. Speaker B regrets not having the opportunity to spend quality time with their grandparents, who were busy running a grocery store before they passed away.\n6. Speaker A is eating their favorite jello.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's wonderful that you're passing on your grandmother's jello recipe to your kids! Family traditions really do hold a special place in our hearts. Maybe you can try a sugar-free version of the jello recipe to cut back on the sugar intake.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information, such as both speakers' connections to jello and family traditions, which relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about teaching kids jello recipes and family traditions. The mentioned grandparents and the idea of Speaker B learning from Speaker A's grandmother are natural connections that could contribute to a conversation about learning and sharing cooking traditions. However, some sentences could be better connected or elaborated, such as Speaker B's minimal cooking experience, which could inform a more detailed suggestion from Speaker A on how to start the learning process. Overall, the MEMORY is somewhat supportive but lacks strong causality and clear development in past interactions."
