Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing? Speaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha! Speaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel.\n2. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans.\n3. Speaker B prefers animals to humans but acknowledges the importance of curing diseases.\n4. Speaker A is scared of sharks but finds the idea of going into a steel cage with them interesting.\n5. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n6. Speaker B has experience scuba diving in Hawaii and found it to be amazing and beautiful.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I love how fascinating they are to observe. Their movements and behavior are so different from traditional pets like cats and dogs. It's like having a window into a completely different world right in my living room.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information, such as identifying that Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel, which directly relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It shows relevancy as Speaker A asks about Speaker B's pets. However, the connection between other points in the MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is not as strong or directly applicable. Points about Speaker A’s fear of sharks or Speaker B’s scuba diving experience don’t aid in generating the next response, as they deviate from the current focus on Speaker B's pet snakes. The MEMORY does indicate Speaker B’s general preference for animals over humans, but it doesn’t enhance the context related to snakes specifically, which was the focus of the conversation. Thus, it provides partial relevance and some level of connectivity, warranting a middle score."
