Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids? Speaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call! Speaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand. Speaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip?  Speaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery Speaker B: Yes I think that's a great idea, how is work at the library?  Speaker A: Busy, and demanding because we are short staffed. While there seems to be little need for a library these days, I find that we have less staff to get everything done Speaker B: Well if you ever need someone to come and help for a couple of hours here and there, give me a call, you know how much I love to be in the library anyway\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is a retired librarian who enjoys implementing creative activities in their library.\n2. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n3. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n4. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B agree on the importance of reading and the value of libraries, despite the rise of the internet.\n6. Speaker A sees parents bringing in their little kids to the library as encouraging.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you so much for the offer, that means a lot. Having your help at the library would truly make a difference, especially during these busy times. I will definitely keep that in mind and reach out when needed.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides a moderate amount of helpful information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. There are relevant connections, such as Speaker B having grandkids and enjoying spending time with them, which aligns with Speaker B's mention of spending time with their grandkids in the context. Additionally, the idea of the fishing trip being an annual tradition is presented in the MEMORY, which connects to the suggestion made by Speaker A about planning different locations. However, some details in MEMORY, like Speaker A being a retired librarian, are inconsistent with DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Speaker A indicates they are currently working at a library. This discrepancy impacts the overall helpfulness. Furthermore, some points in MEMORY, such as the shared value of libraries, don't directly connect with the immediate topics discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, reducing the relevance. Overall, while MEMORY contains relevant elements, there is room for improvement in cohesiveness and consistency with the context."
