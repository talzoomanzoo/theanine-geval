Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet? Speaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there? Speaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay? Speaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately? Speaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n2. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n3. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\n4. Speaker B asks if the recommended book is fiction or nonfiction.\n5. Speaker A, a retired librarian, recommends the book \"Beautiful Ruins\" by Jess Walter for a beach visit.\n6. Speaker B received a new car from their mom and plans to drive during spring break.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds fascinating! \"The Gettysburg Campaign\" must have been quite insightful. I'll have to add it to my reading list. I appreciate the recommendation.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information regarding the ongoing conversation such as Speaker B's plans for a trip and asking Speaker A about book recommendations. However, a few points in MEMORY appear disconnected from the immediate dialogue, like the mention of Speaker B receiving a new car from their mom, which doesn't seem directly related to the context of conversation focused on travel and book interests. Additionally, the sequence of these memory points could be better structured to clearly convey the connection and background of the current discussion, impacting the overall coherence and helpfulness of future dialogue generation."
