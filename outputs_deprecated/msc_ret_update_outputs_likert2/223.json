Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself! Speaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food? Speaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too? Speaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also? Speaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways? Speaker B: They've been better as I left my previous job so I'm spending more time with them, how do you manage to work full time and still keep those animals happy?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid.\n2. Speaker A mentions having dogs and Speaker B admires them for their peaceful nature.\n3. Speaker B has two terrier dogs as pets.\n4. Speaker B has elderly terriers and is planning to leave their part-time job for a break before starting a new one.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B share a love for music and plan to have a house concert with their pets.\n6. Speaker B asks Speaker A if they have had a pet raccoon before.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad to hear you're able to spend more time with your dogs now! It can be tough balancing work and pet care, but I try to make sure they have plenty of toys and activities to keep them busy while I'm away. Plus, coming home to their happy faces makes it all worth it.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that can assist in generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Statements 1 and 3 are helpful as they relate directly to Speaker A's pets (Journey and Sid) and Speaker B's pets (terrier dogs), and pets are relevant to the ongoing discussion about pets and how to prevent them from getting into food. Statement 4 provides additional context about Speaker B's personal situation and is partially relevant, as it reflects on spending time with pets, which is connected to the context. Statement 5, however, diverts the conversation to music and concerts, which is unrelated to the current dialogue about managing pets around food. Statement 6 is irrelevant as Speaker B doesn't ask about having had raccoons before, which doesn't tie into the current flow of conversation. Overall, the MEMORY is moderately helpful but lacks strong coherence and complete direct relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
