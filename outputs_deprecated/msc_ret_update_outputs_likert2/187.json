Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make? Speaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it. Speaker A: I would love to, I enjoy cooking so maybe you can teach me to make it, too?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe.\n2. Speaker A likes cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally.\n3. Speaker A enjoys cooking and finds it helpful for stress relief.\n4. Speaker A plays the drums and loves making food for others.\n5. Speaker A cooked steak, fried potatoes, and shrimp for dinner with their father.\n6.

    "raw_prediction": "Of course, I'd love to teach you how to make spicy fried rice! It's a fun recipe to try out together. Just let me know when you're free to come over.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful information that could assist Speaker B in generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Key points such as Speaker B's enjoyment of cooking and their connection to their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe are relevant and enhance the conversation. Moreover, Speaker A's interest and enjoyment of cooking, as well as their openness to learning new dishes, connect directly to the context of being interested in learning to make garlic chicken. However, some details, like Speaker A's interest in surfing and playing drums or specific meals cooked in the past, are less relevant to the immediate context, which slightly diminishes the overall helpfulness in this specific dialogue. Overall, the MEMORY provides helpful context for fostering a cooking-related discussion."
