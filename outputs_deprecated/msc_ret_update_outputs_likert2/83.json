Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids? Speaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call! Speaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand. Speaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip?  Speaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery Speaker B: Yes I think that's a great idea, how is work at the library?  Speaker A: Busy, and demanding because we are short staffed. While there seems to be little need for a library these days, I find that we have less staff to get everything done\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n2. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n3. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n4. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n5. Speaker A is a retired librarian who enjoys implementing creative activities in their library.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B agree on the importance of reading and the value of libraries, despite the rise of the internet.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides mostly relevant information that can be used to generate a proper response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Here is the reasoning for the score:\n\n1. Sentence 1 directly relates to the ongoing discussion about the fishing trip and the grandkids, tying into Speaker B's enthusiasm about making it an annual event, which is helpful for continuing a natural conversation.\n\n2. Sentence 2 reinforces Speaker B's enjoyment of spending time with the grandkids, which can add depth to their character and interests but isn't directly connected to the dialogue about the fishing trip.\n\n3. Sentence 3 is related to the dialogue context about Speaker A's busy schedule, but the mention of \"kids\" rather than \"grandkids\" makes it slightly less useful for the current topic of conversation.\n\n4. Sentence 4 provides context about a past fishing experience of Speaker B with the grandkids, which is closely related to the topic of the fishing trip and could contribute to a natural continuation of the dialogue.\n\n5. Sentence 5 seems less relevant as Speaker A is not mentioned to be retired in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, creating a possible inconsistency.\n\n6. Sentence 6, although interesting, is not directly relevant to the existing conversation about fishing or work at the library, so contributes minimally to generating a response.\n\nOverall, while there are some helpful and directly related segments, there are also parts that are less closely connected or topic-relevant for generating the next response."
