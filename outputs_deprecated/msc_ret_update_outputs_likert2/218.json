Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B share a love for music and plan to have a house concert with their pets.\n3. Speaker B is interested in taking a Disney cruise and has been watching videos on YouTube about them.\n4. Speaker A has a pet raccoon and has a friend who found baby raccoons.\n5. Speaker A's friend found two baby raccoons in her yard, one of which was given to Speaker A to keep as a pet.\n6. Speaker A is not interested in going on a cruise and would prefer camping as a vacation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Oh, Journey must really love pizza! Sid would probably try to steal a piece too if he could. Maybe we can have a mini house concert soon to distract them from the pizza temptation. What do you think?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides useful context about Speaker A and Speaker B's conversation. It mentions Speaker A's pet raccoon named Journey, which directly relates to Speaker A's statement about Journey eating a piece of pizza. The MEMORY also contains information about shared interests between the speakers, such as their shared love for music and plans to have a house concert with their pets, which could lead to further dialogue development. Additionally, it gives insights about Speaker B's interest in Disney cruises, which could influence future conversational topics. However, while relevant, not all parts of the MEMORY are directly connected to Speaker A's account of Journey eating pizza, and some details may not be immediately useful for crafting a response to the current dialogue context, which is why it doesn't score a perfect 5."
