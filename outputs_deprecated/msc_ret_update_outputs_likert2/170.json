Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me? Speaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week? Speaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day Speaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through Speaker A: Actually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested. Speaker B: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to it. Do you think I will need to rent a car when I'm there, or is it possible to walk and bike in the summer? I always picture huge amounts of snow but I'm not sure if it's like that all year round.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plans to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit.\n2. Speaker B is planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n3. Speaker A invited Speaker B to visit and mentioned looking into flights.\n4. Speaker A has invited Speaker B to visit them and is excited about the trip.\n5. Speaker A mentioned the warm weather at their location.\n6. Speaker A has visited Alaska and describes it as beautiful, suggesting cheap flights to Anchorage.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "You'll be happy to hear that in the summer, walking and biking are great options here! The snow melts, and the city is very pedestrian-friendly. Renting a car isn't necessary, but it could be convenient if we decide to go on a glacier tour or pet some wolves.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model to generate a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes several details that are directly relevant and naturally connected to the conversation at hand. Specifically:\n\n1. There is mention of Speaker A planning to take Speaker B on tours and folk concerts, which aligns with the context where Speaker A talks about local artists performing.\n2. The MEMORY shows Speaker B's interest in visiting and attending concerts, which matches their intention in the dialogue.\n3. Speaker A's excitement and their mention of warm weather in the MEMORY link to their expression of it being lovely weather in the dialogue.\n4. The MEMORY mentions planning activities for the visit, which could be helpful when Speaker B considers whether to rent a car.\n\nHowever, some parts like Speaker A's previous visit to Alaska and flights to Anchorage are not directly relevant to this DIALOGUE CONTEXT. If more cohesive information directly related to the specific trip planning was included, the score could improve further."
