Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Marmalade.\n2. Speaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten.\n3. Speaker B is not a cat person but ends up taking care of stray cats brought home by kids.\n4. Speaker A usually leaves their cats with a friend while traveling.\n5. Speaker B loves dogs.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B have a light-hearted and humorous conversation about their pets and travels.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Pumpkin is perfect for the season! It's a cute and festive choice for the new kitten. I bet Ginger will have her paws full with the little one running around.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful and relevant information that Speaker B can use to engage with Speaker A. For example, MEMORY points 1 and 2 are directly related to the naming and existence of kittens, which connects well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about the kitten's name. MEMORY points 3 through 6 add additional context about the speakers' relationship and interests, particularly regarding pets, which may not be immediately relevant to naming the kitten but could inform Speaker B's style of response. Additionally, MEMORY point 1 mentions that Speaker A considered naming a new kitten Marmalade, which is directly relevant to Speaker A's current decision against that name. Overall, the MEMORY connects moderately well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, providing a baseline for both specific and broader engagement, yet lacks deep causal relationships or highlights progression between events that could increase its usefulness."
