Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting! Speaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow? Speaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from. Speaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n3. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n4. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n5. Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\n6. Speaker B is considering giving up their night job to focus on lab work and school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate the vote of confidence! I've actually tried Beyond burgers before and I agree, they're quite close in taste to real beef. It's amazing how far plant-based alternatives have come. I think it's a good option for those looking to reduce their meat consumption.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information that connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's involvement in lab research and their academic pursuits (point 5: majoring in molecular biology and point 6: considering giving up a night job for lab work and studies). This could provide context for why classes might be too hard, as mentioned in the dialogue. However, other items in the MEMORY, such as Speaker A planning to try Speaker B's cooking or Speaker B's dinner preferences, don't directly contribute to the conversation about cloned and plant-based burgers. The sentences are mostly independent and don't clearly demonstrate causality or development in the relationship that would directly influence the dialogue's progression. The MEMORY lacks a cohesive narrative that directly supports generating a next response in the given dialogue context."
