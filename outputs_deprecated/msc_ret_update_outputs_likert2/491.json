Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for. Speaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for? Speaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work? Speaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol Speaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise?  Speaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n3. Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\n4. Speaker A plans to bring sandwiches and fruit for the hike, specifically asking about veggie sandwiches for Speaker B.\n5. Speaker B enjoys camping, hiking, and is kind, caring, and hopeful for group equality.\n6. Speaker B's neighbor, John, is getting divorced and selling top-of-the-line camping gear.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a fantastic idea! You have a real passion for the outdoors, so being a guide would be such a fulfilling career for you. Sometimes, following our passions can lead us to unexpected opportunities. Who knows, maybe one day you'll be leading hiking tours in the same area where I'll be working at the grocery store!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provided is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains some helpful information, such as Speaker A having applied to work at a grocery store, which aligns with the context of Speaker A discussing the job offer from a grocery store. Additionally, it connects Speaker B to activities like camping and hiking, which resonates with their interest expressed in the park system.\n\nHowever, while some pieces of MEMORY like Speaker A's job application and Speaker B's interest in camping are somewhat relevant, they do not form a clear causality or development in their conversation about current work situations, aspirations, or job applications. Other information like Speaker A's journey or the content of the sandwiches is less relevant to the given dialogue context. Additionally, the memory item regarding Speaker Bâ€™s neighbor, John getting divorced and selling camping gear, does not provide a direct link to their current conversation about jobs or career plans.\n\nOverall, while MEMORY has items that could potentially influence the conversation, the connections are not extensively or naturally elucidated in relation to the dialogue context presented, resulting in a moderate score."
