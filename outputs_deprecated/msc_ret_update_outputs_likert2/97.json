Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing? Speaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from? Speaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there. Speaker B: That's great. I have gotten my pets from the shelter and they seem happy I brought them home. I have a hard time saying no to them which is why I have so many pets. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs. Do you have a name in mind for your cat?  Speaker A: I've thought of a lot of  names, but in the end it will probably depend on the breed and the sex.   Speaker B: That's true. Is pilates hard? I've always wanted to try it but I don't know if it will be too difficult. Speaker A: No, I don't think it's hard.  I actually enjoy it.  It's more fun than work, at least to me. You should give it a try! Speaker B: Maybe I will. Do you think I can start at home by watching Youtube videos, or do I need to go to a Pilates class? Speaker A: You can probably start with Youtube just to see if you like it.  Much better to go to a class I think though.  Of course, I'm biased. I'm in love with my instructor! haha Speaker B: Lol, okay I will definitely try it at home first. If I can get the hang of it, I will sign up for a class. Hopefully I can get an instructor as good as yours lol! \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions.\n2. Speaker A reads a novel a week, lives in the city, and goes to pilates class.\n3. Speaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals, discovered love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets.\n4. Both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy the company of their pets and think they are smart and playful.\n5. Speaker A is interested in getting a dog and likes Akitas.\n6. Speaker B thinks pit bulls are lovely and has one that is kind and sweet.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm sure you'll find a great instructor! And who knows, maybe your pit bull will be interested in joining your Pilates sessions too. They're such curious and loving dogs, just like your sweet one.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically relating to pets and painting, which are topics discussed by the speakers. For example, MEMORY items 1 and 3 are relevant as they reference interactions with pets and a love for painting, both of which are present in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, MEMORY item 2 mentioning Speaker A's habit of reading a novel a week and living in the city, while tangentially related to an interest in pilates, does not directly contribute to the current dialogue. Item 4 about both speakers enjoying their pets is somewhat useful to reinforce their mutual appreciation for animals. The detail in item 5 about Speaker A's interest in Akitas and item 6 about Speaker B's thoughts on pit bulls are specific, but not directly relevant to the current discussion about Speaker A acquiring a new cat and the conversation on pilates. The memories are somewhat naturally connected, but there could be a clearer demonstration of causality or relevancy to the current conversation, thus the score of 3."
