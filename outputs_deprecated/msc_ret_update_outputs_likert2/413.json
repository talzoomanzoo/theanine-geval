Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin! Speaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Marmalade.\n2. Speaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten.\n3. Speaker B is not a cat person but ends up taking care of stray cats brought home by kids.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B have a light-hearted and humorous conversation about their pets and travels.\n5. Speaker A usually leaves their cats with a friend while traveling.\n6. Speaker B loves dogs.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I thought Pumpkin had a nice ring to it, and it matches the season! Plus, I didn't want Ginger feeling jealous with another orange-themed name in the house.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about the speakers and their pets, which can be useful for generating a response in the dialogue. Specifically, memories 1 and 2 are somewhat relevant as they mention Speaker A's consideration of the name Marmalade for the kitten and the fact that their cat recently had a kitten, connecting to the current topic of naming the kitten. However, the MEMORY lacks direct causality or detail about the specific decision to change from Marmalade to Pumpkin, and the other memories (3-6) do not provide direct relevance to the current conversation about the kitten's name change. The memories are somewhat helpful but not fully aligned with the immediate topic of conversation."
