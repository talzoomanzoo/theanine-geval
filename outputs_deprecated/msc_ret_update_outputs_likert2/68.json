Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play?  Speaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music. Speaker A: ah right, who's your favourite rock band?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is in a band and plays music, possibly a musician.\n2. Speaker A is in a band where they play the drums and write music, with 4 members including the singer who is their best friend.\n3. Speaker A is part of a band that tours different countries for their music.\n4. Speaker A wants to see Sublime live one day but doesn't go to many concerts other than the ones their band plays in.\n5. Speaker A is planning a concert in Denver and offers to get tickets for Speaker B.\n6. Speaker A enjoys eating fish, particularly salmon or tuna.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides a decent amount of useful information about Speaker A, which could be used to generate a response from Speaker B. For example, knowing that Speaker A is a musician who plays in a band and enjoys rock music can help Speaker B respond to questions about musical interests or concert plans. These details are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly since Speaker A asks about a favorite rock band, which ties back to their shared interest in music. However, some of the information, such as Speaker A's eating preferences or specific concert plans, is less directly connected to the current context of discussing rock music, meaning not all sentences demonstrate clear causality or relevance. These factors lead to a moderate score."
