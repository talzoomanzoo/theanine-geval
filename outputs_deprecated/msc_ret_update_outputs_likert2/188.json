Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make? Speaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days.

Speaker B: Yeah definitely! I know you like hot foods, so if you learn and can make them fresh it will taste amazing. Have you tried any new foods lately?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe.\n2. Speaker A likes cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally.\n3. Speaker A enjoys cooking and finds it helpful for stress relief.\n4. Speaker A plays the drums and loves making food for others.\n5.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be helpful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It indicates Speaker B's enjoyment of cooking, especially using their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe, which relates to the dish discussed in the conversation. Additionally, Speaker A's interest in cooking new dishes and finding cooking as stress relief are relevant as it aligns with the conversation about learning to cook garlic chicken. However, some details, like Speaker A's drumming or what Speaker B does in their spare time, do not directly relate to this specific context. The MEMORY does provide some relevant background, but not all parts are directly relevant or necessary for generating the next response."
