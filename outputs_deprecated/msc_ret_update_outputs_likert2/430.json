Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing? Speaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha! Speaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes? Speaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe.  Speaker A: You make them sounds so fascinating. Will you take them with you to your college dorm?  Speaker B: I'll be living off campus, so absolutely. How about you? Are you staying in the dorms? Speaker A: I'm glad your taking them with you. My mum wants me to stay in dorms. But I think I just want my own place, less drama and more freedom that way. Speaker B: Yup. My parents wanted me to do the same thing...for \"that experience\". To be honest, I don't want it. It'd just be a distraction! \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel.\n2. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans.\n3. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n4. Speaker B goes to Hawaii for scuba diving and is considering studying marine life or a different type of animal.\n5. Speaker B is a veteran who went to the army after high school, interested in neuroscience and seeking advice on studying it.\n6. Speaker B has an interest in diving and is planning to take neuroscience classes using the GI Bill.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I totally get what you mean. Living off campus sounds like a great decision for you, especially with your focus on your studies. It's important to create an environment that helps you thrive.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information related to Speaker B's interests and experiences with animals, which is relevant given the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about snakes. However, while MEMORY item 1 is directly useful (mentioning the pet snakes' names), most of the other points, such as Speaker B's military service or interest in neuroscience, seem less connected to the context of discussing pet snakes and living situations. Item 1 is helpful, but items 2-6 do not directly facilitate understanding or continuation of the current conversation regarding their living arrangements and preferences for pets. The MEMORY's structure does not effectively demonstrate the causality or relevancy required for high helpfulness, as many sentences seem disjointed from the present dialogue."
