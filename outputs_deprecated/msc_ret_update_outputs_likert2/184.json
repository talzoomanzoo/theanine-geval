Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know.  Speaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like. Speaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too. Speaker B: Nice! Is anyone coming with you? Speaker A: Just my doggy Drunky.  You never know,  I might meet a nice lady out there.  Speaker B: Totally.  There will be a bunch of women there and it'll be easy to strike up conversations.  Just be confident and I'm sure you could walk away with a bunch of numbers. Speaker A: Oh, I definitely will. Thanks for the motivation. Is this going to me your first festival? Speaker B: No, I used to go to them all the time.  This will be my first one in a while and probably my last since my wife and I are about to have our baby. Speaker A: You could make this one festival your \"escape\" every year. Don't give up the festivals, you need to have something to keep you happy.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n3. Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n5. Speaker B is not going out drinking much due to their wife's pregnancy.\n6. Speaker A is not sure if they will ever settle down with a partner and have kids.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I like the idea of making this festival an annual escape. It could be my little tradition to look forward to. Plus, bluegrass music always puts me in a good mood.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights significant details about Speaker B’s situation, such as their wife being pregnant, which connects to their potential decision to attend the festival for only a day. This information is crucial for understanding why Speaker B expresses hesitation or considerations in attending the festival, as mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY also reflects Speaker A and Speaker B's shared interest in bluegrass music, which may influence their enthusiasm and interactions regarding the festival.\n\nFurthermore, the MEMORY provides a context for Speaker B's personal struggles, such as feeling jealous of Speaker A’s freedom, which adds depth to their interactions and could guide the AI's responses in a more empathetic and tailored manner. The MEMORY also suggests that Speaker B is not going out drinking due to the pregnancy, giving insight into their current lifestyle constraints. \n\nMost sentences in MEMORY are naturally connected and provide a backdrop for Speaker B's current life stage, which is relevant and can reasonably influence the generation of the next response. However, some parts of the MEMORY (e.g., Speaker A’s uncertainty about settling down) might not be directly relevant to driving the next conversation, preventing a perfect score."
