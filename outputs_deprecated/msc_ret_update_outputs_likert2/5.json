Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet? Speaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there? Speaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay? Speaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately? Speaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"' Speaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n2. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n3. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\n4. Speaker B asks if the recommended book is fiction or nonfiction.\n5. Speaker A, a retired librarian, recommends the book \"Beautiful Ruins\" by Jess Walter for a beach visit.\n6. Both Speaker A's mother and Speaker A were librarians, but Speaker A is retired.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "\"The Gettysburg Campaign\" is a fascinating account of one of the most critical moments in the Civil War. It delves into the strategies and battles that shaped the outcome of the war. If you're not into history, I would recommend a different genre for you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant pieces of information, such as Speaker B going on a trip, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT discussing travel plans to Costa Rica. The details about Speaker A being a retired librarian provide context for their interest in historical fiction, which is relevant to the dialogue about books. However, some aspects of MEMORY, like Speaker B not having packed yet or the excitement for Easter, do not directly contribute to generating a response for the current dialogue. Additionally, some connections in MEMORY, such as the relationship between Speaker A and their mother being librarians, do not strongly influence or relate to the ongoing conversation. The overall contribution is somewhat helpful, but not entirely cohesive or tied directly to the dialogue."
