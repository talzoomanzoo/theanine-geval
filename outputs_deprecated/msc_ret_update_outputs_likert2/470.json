Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it? Speaker B: Yes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see.  Speaker A: I definitely will, this sounds like such an amazing trip. How long has it been since you've been there yourself? Speaker B: I was in Greece last two years ago.   I am excited to go again soon!    At somepoint I would like to take a cruise around the islands there.  It seems like a neat way to see all the Islands in an easy way.   Have you ever taken a cruise? Speaker A: Only once before when I was very young, so I don't remember much. It sounds like such a relaxing way to enjoy the day, though. Maybe we can plan a cruise together sometime. Speaker B: That would be fun!  I go to Europe a lot so maybe a cruise in the Caribbean would be nice.  I would like to see Saint Lucia and Saint Thomas.  Speaker A: Oh, Europe? I'm already sold on the idea, sounds like a blast! I've never had a negative experience in Europe. Should we visit some of the capital cities?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five.\n2. Speaker A has traveled around Europe before, visiting capital cities of each country.\n3. Speaker B recommends visiting the Parthenon, Acropolis of Athens, and the beach on Corfu Island in Greece.\n4. Speaker B and their kids are excited about their upcoming trip to Greece.\n5. Speaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian.\n6. Speaker A hasn't planned their trip out yet but is open to suggestions.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely! Capital cities are always a great starting point when exploring a new country. Each one has its own unique charm and history to offer. I recommend starting with the iconic ones like Paris, Rome, and London. You'll love the mix of culture, architecture, and delicious food in each city!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, the mention of Speaker A having traveled around Europe aligns with Speaker A's positive remarks about past European experiences. However, several details do not directly correlate with the current conversation. For example, Speaker B is described as planning a trip to Greece for the first time, which contradicts the context where Speaker B mentions having been in Greece two years ago. There is also no mention of Speaker B having kids in the dialogue. The memories are somewhat related but lack precise alignment with the conversation, and the sentences are not cohesively connected to visibly demonstrate causality or progression of past interactions in this dialogue."
