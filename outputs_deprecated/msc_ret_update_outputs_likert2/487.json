Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for. Speaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\n3. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n4. Speaker A plans to bring sandwiches and fruit for the hike, specifically asking about veggie sandwiches for Speaker B.\n5. Speaker A will use the money earned from the store to buy the hammock online.\n6. Speaker B's neighbor, John, is getting divorced and selling top-of-the-line camping gear.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several pieces of helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A has been offered a job at the grocery store. Memory sentences 1 and 3 provide context about Speaker A's background and situationâ€”namely, that they are a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey, and they specifically applied to work at a store near a hiking trail. This can naturally connect to Speaker A's excitement over the job offer, giving insight into their lifestyle and motivations. Memory sentence 5, that Speaker A will use the money from the store to buy a hammock, is somewhat relevant as it highlights their financial plans associated with accepting the job. The connections between these memories develop a sense of causality and relevance to the context of being offered the job. However, sentences 4 and 6 concerning hiking sandwiches and Speaker B's neighbor getting divorced don't directly contribute to the context or demonstrate immediate relevancy, slightly reducing the overall coherence but not significantly. Overall, the memory effectively complements the dialogue by informing possible responses with Speaker A's personal circumstances and future plans related to the job."
