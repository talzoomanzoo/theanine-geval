Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some details about Speaker A and Speaker B's interests and activities, such as enjoying Brazilian food and salsa dancing, which are somewhat related to the dialogue context where Brazilian foods were mentioned. However, it doesn't offer enough relevant and directly helpful information for generating a specific next response to the question about what foods were eaten while watching the movie. The memory lacks strong connections to the specific context of discussing the Black Widow movie and the specific Brazilian foods consumed. Therefore, while there are some tangential links, the memory isn't particularly helpful in creating a contextually rich response based on the dialogue provided."
