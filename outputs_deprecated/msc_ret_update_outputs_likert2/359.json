    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week? Speaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you? Speaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B mentions that Resident Evil can be scary and provides some tips for playing it.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n3. Speaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII.\n4. Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World.\n5. Speaker A prefers tamer video games and is not a fan of horror movies.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy playing video games in their free time.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "How about trying out something like Stardew Valley or Minecraft? They are both very relaxing and enjoyable without any jump scares or intense moments. Plus, we could even play together if you're up for it.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful context for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives background on Speaker B's interest and experience with Resident Evil, as well as the fact that they recently bought Resident Evil VIII, which aligns with the context of their ongoing discussion about Resident Evil. MEMORY also notes Speaker B's enjoyment of different games like League of Legends, which could inform future game recommendations for Speaker A. Additionally, MEMORY captures Speaker A's reluctance towards scary games and their preference for tamer games like Jurassic Park: World, which is important for suggesting games that align with Speaker A's taste. However, the memory does not explicitly connect to suggestions Speaker A seeks in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. More specific information on what non-scary games Speaker A might like or more of Speaker B's insights could have enhanced its helpfulness further. Overall, the MEMORY is mostly relevant and interconnected with the current dialogue but could benefit from a slight increase in specificity and connection to the immediate need in the discussion."
