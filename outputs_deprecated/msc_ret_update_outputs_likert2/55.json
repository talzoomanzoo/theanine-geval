Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B lives in the country, loves nature, and works with animals.\n2. Speaker B enjoys reading the Odd Thomas and Dark Tower series and finds inspiration for their artwork during nature walks.\n3. Speaker A recommends the new album by Highly Suspect to Speaker B.\n4. Speaker A is a fan of the Game of Thrones series and enjoys audiobooks.\n5. Speaker A is a city dweller who walks to work instead of driving.\n6. Speaker A asks about Speaker B's new artwork and acknowledges their need for inspiration.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information for generating a proper next response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains connections and relevance related to both speakers' backgrounds and interests. Speaker B's love for nature and finding inspiration during nature walks (Sentence 2) directly relates to the context of Speaker A mentioning a nature walk. This connection is helpful for Speaker B to respond meaningfully. Additionally, Speaker A's city lifestyle (Sentence 5) contrasts with Speaker B's country living (Sentence 1), offering background context that can influence conversation dynamics or topics. Sentence 6 is also relevant as it ties into the theme of nature walks potentially inspiring Speaker B's artwork. Although some information, such as the music and book preferences (Sentences 3 and 4), is not immediately relevant to the current context, the memory largely supports useful interactions."
