Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing? Speaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from? Speaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there. Speaker B: That's great. I have gotten my pets from the shelter and they seem happy I brought them home. I have a hard time saying no to them which is why I have so many pets. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs. Do you have a name in mind for your cat?  Speaker A: I've thought of a lot of  names, but in the end it will probably depend on the breed and the sex.   Speaker B: That's true. Is pilates hard? I've always wanted to try it but I don't know if it will be too difficult. Speaker A: No, I don't think it's hard.  I actually enjoy it.  It's more fun than work, at least to me. You should give it a try!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions.\n2. Both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy the company of their pets and think they are smart and playful.\n3. Speaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals, discovered love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets.\n4. Speaker B has 5 dogs of different breeds and has rats as pets but didn't include them in the portrait.\n5. Speaker B thinks pit bulls are lovely and has one that is kind and sweet.\n6. Speaker A is interested in getting a dog and likes Akitas.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I might just give pilates a shot then! Who knows, maybe my Persian cats will even join in on the fun and try to mimic the movements. It could turn into a hilarious workout session with my furry buddies!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided offers some useful insights about Speaker B's preferences and interests, which could be leveraged when generating a response. For instance, knowing that Speaker B likes Persian cats, has a fondness for pit bulls, and enjoys painting could be relevant when discussing pets or art-related topics in future dialogues. The information about both speakers enjoying the company of their pets connects with the context of discussing pets and future pet plans. However, the details about Speaker B preferring to paint regular people and discovering a love for portraits through a self-portrait don't directly enhance the DIALOGUE CONTEXT's current trajectory. Additionally, Speaker B's thoughts on pilot seem less relevant to their painting preferences or pet choices. Overall, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful but could be more directly connected or relevant to the ongoing conversation."
