Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A invited Speaker B to visit and mentioned looking into flights.\n2. Speaker A has invited Speaker B to visit them and is excited about the trip.\n3. Speaker A plans to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit.\n4. Speaker B is planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n5. Speaker B is interested in going whale watching and asks about a wolf petting zoo.\n6. Speaker A has visited Alaska and describes it as beautiful, suggesting cheap flights to Anchorage.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains useful information that can help generate an appropriate response. It provides context about Speaker A inviting Speaker B for a visit, and both expressing excitement about the trip. Memory points 3, 4, and 5 detail specific activities such as concerts and outdoor adventures, which can be relevant in continuing the conversation about planning. Additionally, point 6 provides contextual background about Speaker A's past visit to Alaska, which could be relevant if the conversation steers towards discussing destinations or flights. Overall, the MEMORY is well-structured and relevant to the dialogue context, although some sentences could have been more succinctly connected to improve clarity further."
