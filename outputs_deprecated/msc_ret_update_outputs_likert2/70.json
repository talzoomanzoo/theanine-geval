Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play?  Speaker B: I don't know play instrument.

    "raw_prediction": "That's impressive that you've been playing drums for so long! It's awesome that you taught yourself to play. Have you ever considered giving lessons to others?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY provides valuable and relevant information that can help Speaker B generate a proper next response based on the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context involves a conversation about music preferences and experiences related to rock bands and live concerts. MEMORY contains details about Speaker A being in a band, playing the drums, touring, and their concert planning, which directly relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, Speaker Aâ€™s desire to see live concerts and their involvement in musical activities could lead to a continued conversation about concerts, music preferences, and personal experiences in either a musical or audience context, which demonstrates naturally connected causality/relevance to the dialogue. The MEMORY is coherent and structured logically, making it helpful in facilitating the conversation forward."
