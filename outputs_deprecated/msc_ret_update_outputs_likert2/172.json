Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me? Speaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week? Speaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day Speaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through Speaker A: Actually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested. Speaker B: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to it. Do you think I will need to rent a car when I'm there, or is it possible to walk and bike in the summer? I always picture huge amounts of snow but I'm not sure if it's like that all year round. Speaker A: I would definitely recommend looking for a rental car to have on hand. There is a town within walking distance from me, but it can be dangerous to walk with the wolves and elk around, especially at night. Speaker B: I imagine so!!! I wouldn't want to run into a wolf! Ok. I will add car rental to my plans. Do you get scared with your dogs, that you will run into wildilfe like that?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n2. Speaker A mentioned the wildlife, including elk and wolves.\n3. Speaker A suggests going on hikes in Alaska to see wildlife and mentions glaciers as a potential attraction.\n4. Speaker B is interested in going whale watching and asks about a wolf petting zoo.\n5. Speaker A plans to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit.\n6. Speaker A has invited Speaker B to visit them and is excited about the trip.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some helpful information but also some inaccuracies and inconsistencies that reduce its overall helpfulness. The MEMORY correctly reflects that Speaker B is planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in attending a concert (points 5 and 6). However, there are errors such as the mention of activities like \"petting a wolf\" and \"going on a glacier tour,\" which are not mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making these points irrelevant or misleading (points 1, 3, and 4). The MEMORY also accurately captures that Speaker A mentioned wildlife such as elk and wolves (point 2), which aligns with the conversation about renting a car and the presence of wolves. The mixed accuracy and inclusion of extraneous activities that were not part of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT affect the overall coherence and helpfulness of the MEMORY."
