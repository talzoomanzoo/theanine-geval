Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make? Speaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe.\n2. Speaker A likes cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally.\n3. Speaker A enjoys cooking and finds it helpful for stress relief.\n4. Speaker A plays the drums and loves making food for others.\n5. Speaker A cooked steak, fried potatoes, and shrimp for dinner with their father.\n6. Speaker B's grandmother was the matriarch of the family, known for cooking large meals for family gatherings.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds fantastic! I'd love to try your spicy fried rice. The combination of spice and comfort food is always a winner. Cooking together sounds like a great idea.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides several helpful pieces of information that could aid Speaker A in generating a relevant response. Specifically, it contains useful details about Speaker B's enjoyment of cooking, particularly their love for a garlic chicken recipe, which ties in with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about cooking. The MEMORY mentions Speaker B's grandmother and her influence, which aligns with Speaker B's mention of \"the good old days\" in the dialogue. Additionally, the MEMORY notes Speaker A's interest in cooking, which relates well to the context of discussing and possibly making dishes. However, some additional connections and more specific interactions between the speakers would enhance the causality and relevance further, which is why it doesn't receive the highest score."
