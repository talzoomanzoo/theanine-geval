Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast. Speaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project. Speaker A: Quite a few, but it wasn't too crowded. It was a nice change of scenery. What kind of project are you working on? Speaker B: I'm sure the student appreciate that. You teach as a group as apposed to one-on-one right? And one of the companies I work for had their system hit with a virus so I've been upgraded their software to debug the system. Speaker A: I teach group classes and one on one, but I was the student today. I specialize in jiu-jitsu but today I got to be the student in a taekwondo class. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class and enjoys it.\n2. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts.\n3. Speaker A is a martial arts teacher and student and is pursuing an athletic training degree in college.\n4. Both Speaker A and Speaker B are interested in martial arts and enjoy learning new things.\n5. Speaker A is a college student who teaches jiu-jitsu and is lactose intolerant.\n6. Speaker B is busy debugging software and is a runner.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's awesome! It must have been refreshing to switch things up and learn a new martial art. You definitely have a diverse skill set. How did you find the experience compared to your usual jiu-jitsu classes?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information but lacks clear connections and relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n1. The MEMORY mentions that Speaker A is taking a martial arts history class, but the context reveals they are attending martial arts classes as a student, focusing on practice rather than theory.\n   \n2. Both speakers' involvement in martial arts is noted, which is somewhat relevant since the DIALOGUE CONTEXT discusses martial arts. However, the MEMORY's emphasis on Speaker B's sign-up for an online history class is not particularly pertinent to the ongoing conversation about practical martial arts training.\n\n3. Speaker Bâ€™s involvement in software work matches the discussion of working on a project in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but the MEMORY does not connect it to the specific task of debugging a system after a virus attack.\n\n4. Facts about Speaker A being a teacher/student and pursuing an athletic training degree, while informative, do not directly relate to the immediate interaction in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about attending a taekwondo class as a student for a different martial arts experience.\n\n5. Other elements like Speaker A's lactose intolerance or Speaker B being a runner are not relevant to the given context.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides background information but lacks direct ties to the specifics of the conversation and causality, thus limiting its helpfulness for generating the next response."
