Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately? Speaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me. Speaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway? Speaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day! I'll make it as fun as possible. Speaker B: I will someday. just not in the summer when all the bugs are out! Where do you go hiking the most? Speaker A: I like to go hiking in the local trails here. I am familiar with them and there's so many routes that I can take. Sadly, the bugs are as bad here as they are anywhere else..... Speaker B: They can't be that bad in the fall right? I hope? Do you camp most every weekend? Speaker A: A least a couple of times a month. Sometimes, yeah, I go every weekend to relax. Being in nature is so relaxing to me. And nah the bugs aren't too bad in the fall and winter. There's a beautiful river along one trail that I bet you'd love to see. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n2. Speaker A enjoys camping trips and looking for wild animals in the woods.\n3. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n4. Speaker B dislikes bugs and is not a fan of camping, hiking, or the outdoors.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy being outdoors, but Speaker B prefers the fresh air over being in the mud and rain.\n6. Speaker A enjoys hiking, birdwatching, and spotting rare animals.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds lovely, a beautiful river view would be nice to see. Maybe I'll give it a try in the fall when the bugs aren't as bothersome. I might even join you on one of your hiking trips if the weather is just right.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker B's dislike for bugs and the outdoors, including hiking and camping, which aligns with the dialogue context where Speaker B mentions not being a fan of the outdoors and the bugs. Additionally, it highlights that Speaker A enjoys outdoor activities such as hiking and camping, which fits with Speaker A's enthusiasm for hiking and leading friends on trails. However, some parts of the MEMORY, like the detail about Speaker A planning to do a part of the Appalachian Trail and birdwatching, are not linked to the current dialogue context and don't directly contribute to generating the next response. Moreover, some statements about preferences and activities are presented without clear connections or relevance to the current conversation, which reduces the overall helpfulness."
