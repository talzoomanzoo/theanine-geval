Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies! Speaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?   Speaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere! Speaker B: You have a point.  It is nice to see puppies wagging their tail and just following you!  Changing topics, do you have any recipes with asparagus?  You know, it's such a popular vegetable, but I just don't know how to prepare it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mainly cares for dogs at the animal shelter, but also cats, and loves when new puppies are brought in.\n2. Speaker B is interested in volunteering and prefers cats over dogs, especially kittens.\n3. Speaker A enjoys cooking, especially making fajitas, and also volunteers at animal shelters.\n4. Speaker A enjoys grilling indoors and suggests grilled asparagus with lemon on it.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B are excited about the idea of traveling the world and trying different cuisines.\n6. Speaker A dreams of meeting all the puppies from history when they can move through space and time.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I actually love grilling asparagus! One of my favorite ways to prepare it is by grilling it indoors and then squeezing some fresh lemon juice on top. It gives it a nice citrusy kick that really enhances the flavor. Would you like me to share the recipe with you?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes Speaker A's enthusiasm for puppies and involvement in animal shelters, which aligns well with the ongoing discussion about animals. This background helps reinforce Speaker A's positive bias towards puppies they express in the dialogue.\n\nAdditionally, MEMORY item 4 is directly relevant to the shift in conversation towards cooking with asparagus. Speaker A enjoys grilling indoors and has a specific suggestion about grilled asparagus with lemon, which could serve as a natural response to Speaker B's inquiry about asparagus recipes.\n\nThe other points in the MEMORY do provide context, such as Speaker A's cooking interest and their fondness for animals, which are interrelated with the conversations about puppies and recipes. However, points about traveling the world and Speaker A's time-traveling puppy dreams are less directly connected to the current dialogue, preventing a perfect score. Yet, overall, the MEMORY contains helpful elements that guide language model responses in the current context."
