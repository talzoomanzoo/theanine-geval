Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue. Speaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad. Speaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs! Speaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours? Speaker A: Ikea! Their furniture is not to expensive and they have all kinds of furniture that'll go with whatever scheme you're going for. What kind of patio furniture were you looking for? Like a barbeque, chairs, hammock?  Speaker B: I guess I was going to get like an umbrella table and some chairs to go with it or maybe even a screened in gazebo with a fire pit in the middle. Speaker A: That's a great idea! Sounds like a very nice place for a barbeque. What were you planning on grilling for the barbeque?  Speaker B: I'll get the steaks to grill if you will bring the corn. And I have a request for you to play on the guitar, I know you are into country so if you could maybe play a song or two by Miranda Lambert, that would be awesome. Speaker A: Of course! I love Miranda Lambert, any specific song requests?  Speaker B: Nothing specific I love all her songs, I think I'm going get off here so I can try to order that gazebo.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is looking forward to spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights.\n2. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy barbecuing and have a love for pets.\n4. Speaker B plans to bring a new marinade and a six pack of beer for the gathering.\n5. Speaker B plans to grill steaks this weekend and prefers using an old charcoal grill over a gas one.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing furniture and home decor choices.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "No problem at all, I'll be sure to have a few of her songs ready for the barbecue. Enjoy ordering the gazebo, it's going to be a great addition to your patio setup! Let me know if you need any help with anything.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY has some relevant information that could be helpful for generating a next response. The mention of plans to grill steaks aligns with the context where Speaker B said they will get steaks to grill. Additionally, both speakers enjoying barbecuing is related to their current discussion about outdoor gatherings. However, the MEMORY introduces some unrelated or less pertinent details such as Speaker B's preference for an old charcoal grill over a gas one, which hasn't been addressed in the dialogue context. Also, the MEMORY fails to incorporate specific memories that are strikingly relevant to any immediate dialogue functions like Speaker A's love for Miranda Lambert or past interactions related to music, which are discussed in the context. The MEMORY is somewhat scattered and lacks strong cohesion to demonstrate clear causality or relevancy, hence not scoring higher."
