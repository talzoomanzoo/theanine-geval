Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for. Speaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for? Speaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work? Speaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol Speaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\n3. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n4. Speaker A will use the money earned from the store to buy the hammock online.\n5. Speaker B's neighbor, John, is getting divorced and selling top-of-the-line camping gear.\n6. Speaker A plans to bring sandwiches and fruit for the hike, specifically asking about veggie sandwiches for Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm still figuring that out. I've been exploring different options and trying to see what really interests me. John's divorce has given me a glimpse into how unpredictable life can be, so I want to make sure whatever I choose brings me joy and stability. It's all about finding that balance, right? How about you, any long-term career goals or just taking it day by day?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some useful information that could help generate a relevant response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but there are also several pieces of information that lack direct connection to the ongoing conversation. \n\n1. The MEMORY mentions that Speaker A applied at a grocery store near a hiking trail, which adds a detail about the location, but it's not directly relevant unless hiking or the trail is further discussed.\n\n2. The fact that Speaker B's friend worked at the same store could be beneficial if Speaker B mentions knowing people there, but it wasn’t mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\n3. Speaker A being a recent high school graduate on a cross-country journey adds context about Speaker A's background and could influence discussions about their experiences or future plans.\n\n4. Speaker A's plan to use earnings to buy a hammock online and to bring sandwiches and fruit for a hike doesn't directly relate to the current dialogue, unless those activities become part of the conversation.\n\n5. The mention of Speaker B's neighbor John selling camping gear provides background about Speaker B's side work but isn’t connected to the immediate topic of conversation.\n\nOverall, while the MEMORY provides some interesting context and background details, there are few direct ties to the ongoing conversation, leading to a moderate score."
