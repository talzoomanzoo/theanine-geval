Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well? Speaker B: The older one seems to like it while the youngest cannot be bothered. Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon? Speaker A: Yes!  As a matter of fact, I'm visiting my son that lives in Spain next month.  This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has two sons who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next.\n2. Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe.\n3. Speaker B's younger son would be jealous of Speaker A's sons' European tour.\n4. Speaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite worrying about them traveling far away.\n5. Speaker B is good at ice skating and suggests going to an ice skating rink during winter break.\n6. Speaker B has two sons, one of whom has had a girlfriend for several years and the other is secretive.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's exciting! Meeting your son's girlfriend after three years must be a special moment. I hope you have a wonderful time visiting them in Spain.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some useful information but is not thoroughly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It provides background details about Speaker A and B's sons, like their studies abroad in Europe, which is relevant due to the ongoing conversation about visiting sons in Europe. However, only part of the memory directly aligns with the ongoing dialogue. The information about Speaker B being good at ice skating is somewhat relevant but not highlighted in the current conversation. The connection between the sons' studies and travel is not explicitly laid out, resulting in a fragmented memory when considering the context. There is also a slight inconsistency as only Speaker A's son's relationship is mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, while MEMORY references both Speaker B's sons concerning having or not having a girlfriend. Overall, MEMORY provides some helpful context, but its disjunction affects its usefulness."
