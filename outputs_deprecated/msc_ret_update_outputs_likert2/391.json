Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes.  Speaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n2. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly.\n3. Speaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n4. Speaker A is worried about the raccoon potentially eating the bearded dragon.\n5. Speaker A hears raccoons and cats fighting in their neighborhood.\n6. Raccoons are known for being able to escape despite efforts to secure trash containers.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm a bit hesitant about befriending the raccoons. I'm just worried about potential conflicts with other pets in the neighborhood, like my bearded dragon. It's good to hear that Bandicoot is so clever though!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several pieces of information that relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making it somewhat helpful. For instance, it mentions Speaker A's raccoon problem and their plan to use aluminum sheeting to cover holes, which aligns with the context of installing the sheeting. Additionally, Speaker B's belief about raccoons as potential pets and their experience with a raccoon provides some background to Speaker B's suggestion of befriending raccoons instead. However, other aspects of the MEMORY, such as Speaker A's concern about a bearded dragon or the neighborhood fights between raccoons and cats, are not directly connected to the ongoing dialogue, which limits their relevance to generating a proper response. Overall, the MEMORY contains helpful information but could be more directly connected to the current conversation."
