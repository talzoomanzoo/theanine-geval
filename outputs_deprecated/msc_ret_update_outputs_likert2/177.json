Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know.  Speaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n2. Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n4. Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy.\n5. Speaker A frequents live band venues and plays music at home.\n6. Speaker B's wife is pregnant and has three more months to go until the due date.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's incredibly kind of you and your friend! We'd definitely appreciate the offer to stay in the cabin. We'll make sure to discuss the details and let you know. It would be great for my wife to have some extra comfort during the festival.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights that both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music, which is the topic of discussion. It also mentions that Speaker B's wife is pregnant and they are considering logistics for attending a festival, which aligns with the offer Speaker A made regarding the cabin for comfort during the event. Additionally, the memory reveals Speaker B's feelings of jealousy towards Speaker A's freedom to enjoy live music due to the pregnancy, which could influence the tone of Speaker Aâ€™s response. The causal and relevant connections in the memory make it a useful context for Speaker A to generate an appropriate and empathetic response in the dialogue."
