Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies! Speaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?  \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mainly cares for dogs at the animal shelter, but also cats, and loves when new puppies are brought in.\n2. Speaker B is interested in volunteering and prefers cats over dogs, especially kittens.\n3. Speaker A dreams of meeting all the puppies from history when they can move through space and time.\n4. Speaker A enjoys cooking, especially making fajitas, and also volunteers at animal shelters.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B are excited about the idea of traveling the world and trying different cuisines.\n6. Speaker A is more interested in science than music, while Speaker B enjoys listening to Black Sabbath and grilling meat.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Puppies just have this playful energy and innocence that I find absolutely irresistible. They bring so much joy and excitement to the shelter! But don't get me wrong, kittens are adorable too. Each animal has its own unique charm.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information for generating a response to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1 and 2 are particularly useful as they offer insight into Speaker A's and Speaker B's preferences regarding animals, indicating that Speaker A mainly cares for dogs but also likes cats, and Speaker B prefers kittens over puppies. This information helps in understanding the dynamic between the speakers and their differing opinions on animals, which is directly relevant to the dialogue about the differences between kittens and puppies. However, the other sentences in the MEMORY (3, 4, 5, and 6) introduce information that, while providing some context about Speaker A and B's interests and preferences, do not directly contribute to the topic of puppies and kittens, making them less helpful. Additionally, these unrelated details could potentially distract from formulating a focused response related to the ongoing conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, the MEMORY offers some helpful insights, but not all sentences are connected or relevant to the dialogue topic."
