Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes.  Speaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me. Speaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house.  Speaker B: Understandable. Have you ever tried contacting animal control? That's how I got Bandicoot. I was working that day and animal control came by explaining about needing fosters for raccoons. I thought it was weird, so I did it and began to work at the small raccoon cafe that is part of the zoo. I love it.  Speaker A: That is a good idea.  Maybe they could help move them to a safer area.  I have a lot of traffic around and they could get hit if they are coming to my place all the time.  Have you been able to teach your raccoon any tricks? Speaker B: The only trick I was able to teach him, that I deeply regret, was how locks worked. I thought it was cool at first, you know, to see a raccoon unlock a door. And now, I regret it so much. I've had to change the layout of my apartment and put deadbolts on my doors so that Bandicoot can't get out. And, he is sneaky about it. One time, he unlocked the pantry and was eating some cookies! It's like having a toddler that never grows up.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n2. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly.\n3. Bandicoot was a rescue and has been at the Raccoon Cafe since he was a baby.\n4. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n5. Speaker B owns a raccoon named Bandicoot and a bearded dragon named Bob.\n6. Speaker A is worried about the raccoon potentially eating the bearded dragon.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Wow, Bandicoot sounds like quite the troublemaker! I can't imagine the stress of having to constantly outsmart a raccoon. It must keep you on your toes. I hope you find a way to keep him entertained without causing too much chaos in your home.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY has mixed relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Points 1, 2, 3, and 5 are relevant because they provide background information about Speaker B's experience with raccoons and his raccoon named Bandicoot, which could help inform Speaker A's options or understanding in dealing with their own raccoon issue. Point 4 directly aligns with Speaker A's current efforts to address their raccoon problem. However, Point 6 about a bearded dragon does not appear in the context and thus does not provide helpful information for generating the next response. Although some relevant content is present, the MEMORY lacks a clear causality or continuity that would naturally aid in generating a response because the pieces of information seem somewhat scattered and disconnected from the conversation's progression."
