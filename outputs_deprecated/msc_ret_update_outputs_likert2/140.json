Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job. Speaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career. Speaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday. Speaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud. Speaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach? Speaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option. Speaker A: Yes I think history is interesting, too! Both of those subjects would be great because there are probably lots of teaching jobs. What kind of history do you like? Speaker B: I love all sorts of history. Right now I am really getting into the weeds of World War II. There's so much to unpack. Speaker A: For sure! So much happened and it really affected how the world is today. I like learning about the history of places where I have lived, it's really interesting.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n3. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n4. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n5. Speaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\n6. Speaker B suggests trying the game Elder Scrolls, knowing Speaker A plays World of Warcraft.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "It's amazing how interconnected everything is when you start delving into history. Have you ever considered incorporating historical elements into your robotics teachings? It could make for some fascinating interdisciplinary lessons.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly regarding Speaker A's interest in teaching computer science and Speaker B's considerations around teaching and their interest in linguistics. These points are helpful for generating a response since they align with the current discussion topics such as career options and teaching. However, many of the MEMORY points, including volunteering and video game suggestions, are less relevant to the immediate context of teaching and career discussion. Additionally, while some connections are inferred, the MEMORY could do more to naturally connect these points, enhancing causality and relevance to the conversation at hand."
