Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids? Speaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call! Speaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand. Speaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip?  Speaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery Speaker B: Yes I think that's a great idea, how is work at the library?  Speaker A: Busy, and demanding because we are short staffed. While there seems to be little need for a library these days, I find that we have less staff to get everything done Speaker B: Well if you ever need someone to come and help for a couple of hours here and there, give me a call, you know how much I love to be in the library anyway Speaker A: I will keep that in mind as we do have volunteer hours available. How is your family doing these days?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n2. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n3. Speaker A is a retired librarian who enjoys implementing creative activities in their library.\n4. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n5. Speaker A sees parents bringing in their little kids to the library as encouraging.\n6. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "The family is doing well, thank you for asking. We've been keeping busy with the grandkids and planning for our next fishing adventure. It's always great to spend time outdoors with them and see their reactions to nature.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY section provides several useful pieces of information that can help generate a proper response for Speaker B in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it contains information about Speaker B's enjoyment of spending time with their grandkids (1), plans for an annual fishing trip (4), and a previous fishing experience with mixed reactions from the grandkids (6). This connects well with the dialogue since Speaker B mentions spending time with the grandkids and the idea of the fishing trip. Additionally, the memory includes insights about Speaker B's appreciation of nature and interest in a tradition which could be beneficial if the conversation about the fishing trip continues. However, some entries like Speaker A's status as a retired librarian (3) or parents bringing kids to the library (5) are less relevant to the immediate dialogue. Despite this, the memory is mostly coherent and relevant, providing useful context for the discussion, justifying a score of 4."
