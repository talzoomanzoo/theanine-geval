Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n2. Speaker B shared tips on repelling mosquitos using sprays with 20% DEET and other active ingredients.\n3. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n4. Speaker B gets scared by bugs and creepy crawlies in the outdoors.\n5. Speaker A enjoys hiking, birdwatching, and spotting rare animals.\n6. Speaker A enjoys camping trips and looking for wild animals in the woods.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is clear from the details that Speaker A is interested in hiking and camping, as well as being outdoors in nature, which correlates with the context where Speaker A talks about repellent and mosquito bracelets—this is directly linked to Speaker B's past advice on mosquito repelling (memory points 2 and 4). Moreover, Speaker B's enjoyment of hiking and interest in repelling mosquitoes is helpful background for Speaker A's response, as Speaker B’s interest in hiking (memory point 1) nicely links with Speaker A’s mention of repellent, reflecting their shared interests and mutual discussions. However, some details like Speaker A's enjoyment of birdwatching or the mention of them planning trips (memory points 5 and 3) are slightly less immediately pertinent without clearer causality or direction in the dialogue. Overall, the MEMORY provides connective background information, but not all elements feel completely necessary to the stated context."
