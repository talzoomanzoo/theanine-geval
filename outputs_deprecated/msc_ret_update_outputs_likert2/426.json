Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing? Speaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha! Speaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes? Speaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel.\n2. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans.\n3. Speaker B prefers animals to humans but acknowledges the importance of curing diseases.\n4. Speaker A's interest in neuroscience was further fueled by their experience in a research lab and being in the Eagle Scouts.\n5. Speaker A is interested in scuba diving and neuroscience, with experience in a research lab.\n6. Speaker A is scared of sharks but finds the idea of going into a steel cage with them interesting.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's fascinating! It's amazing how diverse the animal kingdom is and how much we can learn from observing different species. Have you ever thought about incorporating your love for reptiles into your scientific interests?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some details that could potentially assist in generating a response. For example, Speaker B's preference for animals over humans and Speaker A's interest in neuroscience might lead to discussions around science, preferences, or even contrasting interests. However, the connection between DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY is not very strong, as the context focuses more on Speaker B's snakes and their interest in reptiles. Although there's a shared theme of interest in animals and science, the relevancy and causality are not particularly clear or directly tied to the current dialogue context. Therefore, while there is some relevant information, the effectiveness of MEMORY in providing helpful information for generating a next response is limited."
