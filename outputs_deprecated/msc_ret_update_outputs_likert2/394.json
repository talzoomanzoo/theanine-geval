Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes.  Speaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me. Speaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house.  Speaker B: Understandable. Have you ever tried contacting animal control? That's how I got Bandicoot. I was working that day and animal control came by explaining about needing fosters for raccoons. I thought it was weird, so I did it and began to work at the small raccoon cafe that is part of the zoo. I love it.  Speaker A: That is a good idea.  Maybe they could help move them to a safer area.  I have a lot of traffic around and they could get hit if they are coming to my place all the time.  Have you been able to teach your raccoon any tricks?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n2. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly.\n3. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n4. Bandicoot was a rescue and has been at the Raccoon Cafe since he was a baby.\n5. Speaker A hears raccoons and cats fighting in their neighborhood.\n6. Speaker B mentioned that raccoons cannot legally be sold as pets, but can be rescued and cared for before being released back into the wild.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "Yes, Bandicoot has been a quick learner! I've been teaching him some basic tricks like rolling over and standing on his hind legs. It's amazing how intelligent and curious raccoons can be. If you ever decide to befriend them instead of keeping them away, you might be surprised at how entertaining and charming they can be.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information that can help generate a suitable next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it provides several pieces of information about Speaker B's experience with raccoons, such as their interest in training the raccoon (1), their views on raccoons as pets (2), Bandicoot's background as a rescue (4), and legal information about raccoons as pets (6). These points are naturally connected and relevant to the conversation about raccoons and animal control. However, the point about Speaker A hearing raccoons and cats fighting (5) is not directly relevant to the current dialogue and could be seen as slightly less connected. Overall, the MEMORY helps provide context and further depth to the conversation about raccoons."
