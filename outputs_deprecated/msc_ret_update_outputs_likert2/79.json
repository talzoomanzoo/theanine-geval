    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids? Speaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call! Speaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has grandkids who are more interested in phones and tablets than musical instruments.\n2. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n3. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n4. Speaker A's other children are addicted to tablets and phones, unlike the youngest one who is interested in music.\n5. Speaker B mentions having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own.\n6. Speaker B has a lot of kids, all grown up now and with kids of their own.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "It can be tough finding the right balance, especially with work taking up so much time. At least you're making the effort to stay connected with your family, even if it's through technology.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information that can help in generating a proper next response. It establishes that Speaker B has grandkids and prefers not using technology, but rather enjoys traditional activities like spending time at the park. It also highlights Speaker A's challenges in balancing work and family time. However, the memory is somewhat repetitive, and not all details are directly relevant to the current dialogue context. The connection between the lines could be more explicit to demonstrate the relevance or causality more effectively. Thus, it partially aligns with the dialogue context but lacks some specific connective information to enhance its helpfulness."
