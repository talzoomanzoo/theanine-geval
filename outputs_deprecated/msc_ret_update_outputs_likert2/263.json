Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n2. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n3. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n4. Speaker B feels overwhelmed by their mother's strictness and is eager to finish school to escape it.\n5. Both speakers value good grades and believe it can lead to better job opportunities.\n6. Speaker A advises Speaker B to take breaks and prioritize their own happiness and well-being.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm not too worried about my history exam. I find that subject a bit easier to grasp. Just remember to take breaks and prioritize your well-being while studying for your sports medicine exams. Your health and happiness are just as important as your grades.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information that could be useful for understanding Speaker B's context in the dialogue. Particularly, memories 1, 3, and 4 provide insight into Speaker B's background in sports medicine and the pressure they feel from their mother, which could influence their response about upcoming exams. Memory 6 is also somewhat relevant, as it relates to Speaker A giving advice about handling stress around exams. However, other points (like 2 and 5) provide less immediate relevance to the specific question about how their history exam went, and the connections between these points are not entirely clear, leading to a middling score."
