Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing.\n2. Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden.\n3. Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more.\n4. Speaker A jokes about space weeds and expresses a desire to see space.\n5. Speaker A plays the clarinet in a band concert and has a solar investment for their office building.\n6. Speaker B is also interested in space exploration and plant science, expressing concerns about the fuels used for space travel.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! I'd be happy to help. What kind of plants are you thinking of growing in your garden?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several pieces of information that are useful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, which is directly relevant to Speaker A's request for gardening suggestions. The MEMORY also suggests shared interests in space exploration and plant science, which could be leveraged for a response that connects gardening with space plants or innovation in gardening techniques. While the mention of Speaker A playing the clarinet and having a solar investment does not directly relate to gardening, these details do not detract significantly from the overall helpfulness since they offer some personality insights without cluttering the context. Overall, the MEMORY is moderately cohesive and relevant, providing a good basis for a thoughtful response."
