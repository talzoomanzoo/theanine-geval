Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it! Thank you for the recommendation. Speaker B: Of course. I recommend that movie to everyone I meet. I think I've watched it over one hundred times. So what is the next movie on your list to watch soon? Speaker A: Yeah it was great and I will also recommend to people when they ask what movie is good. So next is another one you recommended which is coming to America. What’s the next movie your going to watch?  Speaker B: There is a horror genre movie that was released just this week which I'm going to watch tonight. It is called \"Girl Next.\" Speaker A: Oh that sounds interesting, I will look into that and put it on my list. How has your job been going? Is there where you get all these great ideas for what to watch?   Speaker B: My Film Studies professor job has been going absolutely great lately. I love all my students, because they really get into the lectures and ask lots of questions. Yes, my job requires me to watch movies all the time, so that is how I find the best ones. Is your programmer job going all right lately? Speaker A: That sounds amazing. Super lucky to have students that really enjoy what they are learning about and I’m sure that’s down to the way you teach and what you teach them. I’m so glad it is all going well for you. Yeah it is going much better now, I’m really getting in the swing of things thank you for asking.  Speaker B: You're welcome. So, returning to the subject of Pulp Fiction, did you think it was funny? Did you think it was too violent for kids to watch? Speaker A: Yeah there was some funny parts in that movie. I kinda think it may be a little to violent for kids, but I would just allow it to each parent to decide I would probably let my grandkids watch. What is your opinion? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in watching movies, mentioned Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman.\n2. Speaker B is knowledgeable about movies and provides recommendations based on Speaker A's preferences.\n3. Speaker B used to teach Film Studies and carefully chooses what movies to watch.\n4. Speaker A relies on Speaker B for movie suggestions, mentioning a preference for comedies.\n5. Speaker B enjoys watching suspense films, action, SF, horror, westerns, drama, and occasional good comedy.\n6. Speaker B has kids and enjoys watching movies with them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I agree with you. Pulp Fiction has its moments of humor, but the violence is definitely intense. I would also lean towards not recommending it for kids unless they are older and mature enough to handle it. It's always best for parents or grandparents to make that decision based on what they feel is appropriate for their children.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY is generally helpful in providing context for Speaker B's next response in the dialogue. It captures Speaker A's interest in movies and reliance on Speaker B's film recommendations, which is relevant to their conversation about \"Pulp Fiction\" and other films. Memory point 3 is particularly significant as it highlights Speaker B's background in Film Studies, linking directly to their extensive knowledge of movies—a key aspect currently discussed in the dialogue context. Furthermore, memory points 4 and 5 acknowledge the range of genres Speaker B enjoys, which complements the ongoing discussion about suitable films for different audiences and adds depth to their film knowledge. However, memory points 1, 2, and 6 are less directly connected to the current conversation. \n\nOverall, MEMORY provides relevant information that aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but could benefit from slight improvements in specificity to earn a perfect score."
