Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n2. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n3. Speaker A enjoys watching Jeopardy with their grandchildren and cooking for them, with the busiest time being the weekend.\n4. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n5. Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves by using technology or watching TV.\n6. Speaker A suggests taking naps during quiet times and mentions watching her grandkids.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a thrilling read! It's great that you're enjoying it. Sometimes a good book can be the perfect escape, especially after spending time with the grandkids.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains several pieces of information about Speaker A's relationship with their grandchildren, which are somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as the context mentions that Speaker A did not watch their grandkids and had time to read a book. However, the details provided in the MEMORY about Speaker A's habits with their grandchildren, such as enjoying Jeopardy and cooking for them, aren't directly connected to the specific conversation about the book. The MEMORY does provide a background context that Speaker A frequently watches their grandchildren, which helps understand why they might be enjoying a break and finding the book exciting, but the details do not extend the current conversation beyond this understanding. \n\nThe MEMORY's usefulness is thus limited in generating the next response, as much of the information doesn't directly relate or develop the current context of the book or why it might be so intense for Speaker A. The causality or relevancy between the MEMORY and the context isn't strongly established beyond understanding Speaker A's general life situation."
