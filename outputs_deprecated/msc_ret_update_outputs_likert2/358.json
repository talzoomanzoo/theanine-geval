Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week? Speaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes relevant details about Speaker B's interest in Resident Evil and specifically mentions that Speaker B recently purchased Resident Evil VIII, which aligns with their current engagement with the game. Additionally, it highlights Speaker A's hesitancy to try Resident Evil but confirms their mutual interest in video games. This context helps Speaker A understand Speaker B's enthusiasm for the game due to the weather, and it sets the stage for a conversation about whether Speaker A should try it out despite their hesitation. However, the MEMORY could be improved if it specifically addressed any prior discussions regarding stormy weather conditions being ideal for gaming."
