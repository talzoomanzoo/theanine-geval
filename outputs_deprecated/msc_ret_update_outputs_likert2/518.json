    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well? Speaker B: The older one seems to like it while the youngest cannot be bothered. Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon? Speaker A: Yes!  As a matter of fact, I'm visiting my son that lives in Spain next month.  This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now! Speaker B: Oh nice. You must be looking forward to it. He must have told you a lot about her. Do you think you would like her? Speaker A: I think so.  She seems like a very sweet girl and she seems to care deeply about my son, so that's what matters most.  You know, maybe I can stop by and visit you as well, since you live in Europe.  France, Spain, Italy?  Where are you living now? Speaker B: Bless her, that's good to hear. That would be great! I live in Portugal. It's not too far from Spain. We can always arrange something. How long would you be there for? Speaker A: I'm planning to stay in Spain for three weeks.  Since you live in Portugal, I'd love to stop by for a visit if you're free this coming month.  I've always wanted to visit Lisbon.  It has the world's longest bridge! Speaker B: That'a great idea. We have a holiday house just outside of Lisbon. You are welcome to lodge with us. Speaker A: Sounds great!  I'm already very excited about my trip to Spain, and now I get to visit you in Lisbon!  I need to brush up on my Spanish and also start studying Portuguese. Speaker B: Haha, you've got your hands full then. Portuguese would be easier I believe. Spanish is a bit harder because it is spoken quicker. Would you be travelling with any company? Speaker A: No, I'll be traveling solo this time around.  My husband does not have a lot of vacation time, so I'll be on my own.  In the meantime, I'll start watching soap operas in Spanish and Portuguese.  They can be so exciting!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has two sons who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next.\n2. Speaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite worrying about them traveling far away.\n3. Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe.\n4. Speaker B's younger son would be jealous of Speaker A's sons' European tour.\n5. Speaker A's boys are leaving again in a few months for another trip after studying abroad.\n6. Speaker A is a family man who loves spending time with his sons.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear that you'll be visiting on your own. It will give you a chance to fully immerse yourself in the language and culture. Soap operas are a fun way to pick up some new phrases and get a feel for the language. I'm sure you'll have a fantastic time in Spain and Portugal!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information, such as Speaker A's connection to Europe and their sons' involvement in Europe, including their studying abroad. This relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A discusses visiting their son in Spain. However, MEMORY does not directly address the core of the contextâ€”Speaker A's upcoming trip and interaction plans with Speaker B in Portugal. Additionally, several statements about Speaker A's sons' travels and characteristics (e.g., jealousy from Speaker B's younger son, sons going to Italy next) are loosely connected or potentially inconsistent with DIALOGUE CONTEXT, offering little direct support in generating the next response. Causality and relevancy are not clearly or explicitly demonstrated in all sentences."
