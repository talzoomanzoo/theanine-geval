    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume. Speaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment.  Speaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon? Speaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully.\n2. Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks.\n3. Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n4. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next.\n5. Speaker B is interested in making origami animals and finds the idea cute.\n6. Speaker A volunteers at a hospital and enjoys making origami crafts, specifically a 3D modular swan with glue.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "It's great to hear that you're interested in learning origami! I personally find it to be a mix of both easy and challenging. Some designs can be quite simple once you get the hang of the basic folds, while others require more intricate techniques and precision. But with practice and patience, I'm sure you'll enjoy the process of creating your own origami animals.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that can be helpful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, it confirms that Speaker A enjoys origami (relevant to their winning the contest) and has successful experience (lotus flower) â€“ although this overlaps with Speaker A's future goal mentioned in sentence 4. Sentence 2 aligns with the context where Speaker A might teach Speaker B, which is mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nHowever, sentences 3, 4, 5, and 6 introduce mixed or not immediately relevant information. Sentence 4 directly contradicts sentence 1 (implying Speaker A has not yet made a lotus origami), and sentence 3 doesn't add crucial context for the current conversation. Sentence 5, while interesting, isn't necessary for Speaker A's response, and sentence 6 about volunteering is unrelated to the immediate dialogue but adds depth to Speaker A's character. \n\nThe memory includes a mix of potentially relevant and unnecessary details, some lack clarity on causality or context relevance, thus earning a middle-ground score."
