Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume. Speaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment.  Speaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon? Speaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think? Speaker A: It depends on what you are trying to make out of origami, you can make some super complicated stuff, there's actually special paper that you can get for it! You may have seen origami be used in the hospital for some breathing aperatus! Speaker B: That's amazing. I had no idea, but that totally makes sense. Do you have to practice a lot -- sort of a use it or lose it kind of thing? Speaker A: Yea, I think for the more complicated origami it's kind of a use it or lose it but for the simple stuff you can usually take a couple months of and still remember to do it! Did you see origami in Japan?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n2. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully.\n3. Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks.\n4. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next.\n5. Speaker B is interested in making origami animals and finds the idea cute.\n6. Speaker A volunteers at a hospital and enjoys making origami crafts, specifically a 3D modular swan with glue.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I did see origami in Japan! It was incredible to witness the intricate designs and the skill involved in creating them. I can't wait to learn more about it from you and maybe even try making some adorable origami animals together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides a mix of helpful and less relevant information for generating a response in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The helpful parts include:\n\n1. Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami, aligning with the context where Speaker B expresses interest in learning origami (\"Yes, I'd love for you to teach me...\").\n2. Speaker B is interested in making origami animals, which could expand the conversation on types of origami.\n3. Speaker A enjoys making origami crafts and even volunteers at a hospital, incorporating origami in their service, which relates to the mention of origami usage in hospitals in the dialogue.\n\nHowever, some details present in MEMORY, such as the specifics of Speaker A's self-learning or plans to make a Lotus flower, do not directly enhance the conversational flow or causality present in the given context. The connection between the MEMORY and immediate DIALOGUE CONTEXT could be improved for a higher score."
