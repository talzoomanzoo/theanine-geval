Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet?  Speaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name? Speaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended.  Speaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n2. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n3. Speaker A is interested in training tips for the kittens and is open to adopting one despite having a parrot.\n4. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n5. Speaker A suggested the name Zhao for one of the kittens.\n6. Speaker B has an older mellow cat and is concerned about training the new energetic kittens.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information about the characters in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It confirms that Speaker A has a parrot and is considering adopting a rescue kitten, which aligns with the current conversation. However, it includes some details that are not immediately relevant to generating the next response, such as the specific names suggested (Zhao) or the Mandarin naming considerations, which are not mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While the MEMORY provides some useful context about Speaker A's interest and the situation with Speaker B, it could be more concise and directly connected to the current conversation for a higher score. The causality is somewhat demonstrated, but not in a way that suggests they're more than just separate facts placed together."
