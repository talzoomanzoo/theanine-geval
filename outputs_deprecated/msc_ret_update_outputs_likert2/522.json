Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer? Speaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to? Speaker A: The museum has all sorts of galleries.  It has a sculpture garden outside.  I mostly like the impressionist paintings.  I like Van Gogh.  Was your concert outdoors? Speaker B: Yes. That way they could have a fireworks show too. I love fireworks. Have you ever seen the fireworks at the Disney castle?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys going to museums and trying different foods.\n2. Speaker A loves Disney music.\n3. Speaker A is interested in music concerts and planning a trip to Sao Paulo.\n4. Speaker B has seen Three Dog Night in concert and enjoys their live shows.\n5. Speaker A is planning to visit the Museum of Art of São Paulo next week with their boyfriend.\n6. Speaker B is waiting for bands to announce their summer tour schedule to plan which shows to attend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "No, I haven't seen the fireworks at the Disney castle, but I've heard they are absolutely magical. I hope to experience it someday. Watching fireworks at a concert sounds like a fantastic combination of music and visual spectacle.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it contains details about Speaker A's interest in museums and music concerts, which aligns with the context of Speaker A discussing a museum visit. Additionally, Speaker A's love for Disney music may connect with the context about fireworks at the Disney castle, though only tangentially. However, the MEMORY does not explicitly connect causality or offer detailed information that directly supports generating the next response. Therefore, while there is some helpfulness, it is limited and not comprehensive enough to warrant a higher score."
