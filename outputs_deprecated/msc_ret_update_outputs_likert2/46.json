Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job! Speaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n2. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n3. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n4. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n5. Speaker B is a professional in a practice, where it is illegal for them to have relationships with clients.\n6. Speaker A is married and has been for four years.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I do still enjoy it, even after all these years. It can be challenging at times, but it's incredibly rewarding to see the progress and growth in my clients. Plus, it's a field where I can constantly learn and grow myself, which keeps it interesting.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information about Speaker B being a therapist and has been working in their own practice for about six years, which connects to their interest in helping people as discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This provides some helpful context for Speaker B's expertise and perspective as a therapist. However, other details in the MEMORY, such as Speaker B's interest in football or the fact that Speaker A knows about horses, are not particularly relevant to the current conversation and don't add helpful context for generating a response to Speaker A's question about enjoying therapy. Therefore, while the MEMORY includes some helpful information, it also contains several unrelated elements that do not provide additional relevance or causality for the given dialogue context."
