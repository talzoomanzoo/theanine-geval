    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for. Speaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for? Speaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work? Speaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol Speaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise?  Speaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows. Speaker A: That sounds wonderful! You'd get to just be out in nature all day. Sounds like a great job, especially if you're a bit introverted like me. That's why hiking is my favorite -- a good solitary activity.  Speaker B: Yes, I agree. What kind of hours would this new job have? Speaker A: It's third shift, which isn't the greatest, but it pays a bit more than the other shifts, and I think I'll like getting off early in the morning. Then I can just go down and get in my hammock and have a nice relaxing moment after work.  Speaker B: Would you feel safe being out there all alone, possibly falling asleep? That just sounds a bit risky. Speaker A: Yeah, you know the area it's in. It's pretty safe, but I'm also a light sleeper. Thank you for your concern though. You are a good friend.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking, mentioning setting up a hammock at their campsite.\n3. Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\n4. Speaker B enjoys camping, hiking, and is kind, caring, and hopeful for group equality.\n5. Speaker A has a portable hammock for the hike and asks if Speaker B will bring theirs.\n6. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad to hear you feel safe and that you enjoy your alone time in nature. It's important to prioritize your well-being, especially when you're out on your own. Your new job sounds like it will provide the perfect balance between work and relaxation in your hammock. If you ever need someone to hike with or just hang out, I'm here for you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3 \n\nExplanation: MEMORY provides some helpful information, such as Speaker A applying to work at a grocery store and enjoying activities like camping and hiking, which aligns with the dialogue about enjoying nature. Additionally, Speaker A has a portable hammock, which relates to their preference for solitude after work. However, MEMORY contains some details that are not directly connected to the dialogue context (e.g., Speaker B's friend working at the same store, Speaker A's recent graduation and journey, Speaker B's qualities). The information is somewhat relevant but not entirely cohesive with the specific conversation flow, and it lacks a clear demonstration of causality or development between interactions."
