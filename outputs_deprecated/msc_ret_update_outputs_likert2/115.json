Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok?  Speaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish? Speaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus! Speaker B: Oh that sounds absolutely fabulous. Are you going to get a free dessert, as well? Speaker A: Yes, I am thinking about trying either the new eclairs, or their tres leches cake with fresh raspberry jam sauce and lemon drizzle! I have too many good options to pick from! What one would you pick? Speaker B: Hands down, I would pick the tres leches. Ever since I tried it a few years ago, it has always been my favorite dessert.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n2. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n3. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n4. Speaker B loves the beach and Mediterranean food.\n5. Speaker A's restaurant plays a mix of songs, mainly easy listening, to create a relaxing environment for diners.\n6. Speaker A's schedule at the restaurant includes working doubles on Saturdays and 8-hour shifts on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's a great choice! The tres leches cake with fresh raspberry jam sauce and lemon drizzle is definitely a fan favorite here. I'll make sure to save you a piece for when you visit next time.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information about Speaker A's job at a restaurant, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where they discuss food at the restaurant. For example, knowing that Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets free meals (memory item 1) provides context for why they are excited about the new menu items. It also helps to understand why Speaker A is discussing food choices with enthusiasm. However, some aspects, like Speaker B's love for the beach and Mediterranean food (memory item 4), aren't particularly relevant to this dialogue context. Additionally, the connection between some memory items and the dialogue context is not very strong, such as information about Speaker A's work schedule (memory item 6) and the type of music played at the restaurant (memory item 5), which don't significantly impact the current conversation about meals and dessert options. Thus, the memory has a mix of helpful and less relevant information, making it reasonably supportive but not entirely so."
