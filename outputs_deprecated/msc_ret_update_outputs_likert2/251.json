Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has a government job that pays the bills but wishes they could work in interior design.\n2. Speaker A finds job searching challenging and hopes to settle in the new city soon with a steady income.\n3. Speaker A is applying for a project coordinator role at a charity but aspires to become a project manager in the future.\n4. Speaker B has two kids and enjoys painting and taking naps.\n5. Speaker A has recently received a call for a job interview and is excited about it.\n6. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I've definitely thought about it. Interior design is a passion of mine, but the stability of my government job is hard to walk away from with two kids to support. Maybe one day I'll take the leap and pursue something more creative full-time.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for generating a proper next response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Each sentence in the memory offers insights or previous interactions and aspirations of Speaker B, which are directly related to the inquiry from Speaker A about pursuing creative work full time. The mention of Speaker B's government job and interior design aspirations (Sentence 1) is directly relevant to the context, as is their enjoyment of creating horror movies with their dad (Sentence 6). These pieces of information highlight Speaker B's current situation and creative interests, which can be used to generate an informed and supportive response. The memories about Speaker A provide context for their situations, adding depth to the conversation. Overall, the memory is coherent and presents a natural connection between past interactions and the current discussion topic."
