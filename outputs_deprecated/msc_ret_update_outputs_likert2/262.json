Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n2. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n3. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n4. Speaker A enjoys hiking and just finished a 5-mile hike with a friend named Dave.\n5. Speaker A goes hiking and does not vote.\n6. Speaker B feels overwhelmed by their mother's strictness and is eager to finish school to escape it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "It went okay, I think I did decently. But I can't help feeling anxious about the results. The pressure to maintain straight A's is really getting to me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful background information that is largely relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which centers on the outcome of an exam. Specific helpful points include that Speaker B is taking a sports medicine exam, which directly links to the exam mentioned in the dialogue. Memory items 1 and 3 are especially relevant, offering insights into the significance of the exam for Speaker B, as they train in sports medicine and feel pressured to achieve high grades due to family expectations. However, some items (e.g., items 4 and 5 about hiking and voting) do not directly relate to the dialogue about the exam potentially diluting the focus. Despite this, the memory paints a comprehensive picture of Speaker B's motivations and pressures, which could guide a language model in anticipating Speaker B's emotional response or elaboration in the dialogue."
