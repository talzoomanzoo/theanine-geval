Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it? Speaker B: Yes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see.  Speaker A: I definitely will, this sounds like such an amazing trip. How long has it been since you've been there yourself? Speaker B: I was in Greece last two years ago.   I am excited to go again soon!    At somepoint I would like to take a cruise around the islands there.  It seems like a neat way to see all the Islands in an easy way.   Have you ever taken a cruise? Speaker A: Only once before when I was very young, so I don't remember much. It sounds like such a relaxing way to enjoy the day, though. Maybe we can plan a cruise together sometime. Speaker B: That would be fun!  I go to Europe a lot so maybe a cruise in the Caribbean would be nice.  I would like to see Saint Lucia and Saint Thomas.  Speaker A: Oh, Europe? I'm already sold on the idea, sounds like a blast! I've never had a negative experience in Europe. Should we visit some of the capital cities? Speaker B: I would like to go to Paris.  Since I live in Amsterdam I could take the train down.  I have seen much and Italy and Greece but would love to go to Paris.  Have you been there before? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has traveled around Europe before, visiting capital cities of each country.\n2. Speaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five.\n3. Speaker B and their kids are excited about their upcoming trip to Greece.\n4. Speaker B recommends visiting the Parthenon, Acropolis of Athens, and the beach on Corfu Island in Greece.\n5. Speaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian.\n6. Speaker A hasn't planned their trip out yet but is open to suggestions.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Paris sounds like a fantastic choice! I've been to Paris before and it was truly magical. The Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, and Notre Dame Cathedral are must-see attractions. Taking the train from Amsterdam to Paris sounds like a lovely journey too. I'm sure you'll have an amazing time exploring the city of love!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: While the MEMORY contains some relevant information, it also contains inaccuracies and gaps that limit its helpfulness. Relevant information such as Speaker A's openness to trip suggestions and potential travels in Europe is not contained, even though Speaker A is actively planning a trip to Europe. There are also discrepancies between MEMORY and DIALOGUE CONTEXT that affect coherence, such as MEMORY suggesting Speaker B is excited about their first trip to Greece when Speaker B actually states they have been to Greece before. Furthermore, the potential relevance of Speaker B's family plans for a trip are missing from Dialogue Context. With some inaccuracies and a lack of clear relevance and connection, the MEMORY achieves only moderate helpfulness."
