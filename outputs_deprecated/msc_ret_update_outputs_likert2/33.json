Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n4. Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n5. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n6. Speaker B's parents still live in Sweden, and they find it expensive to travel there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides several relevant pieces of information that can help Speaker B generate a next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The details about both speakers planning a trip to Sweden together, Speaker A considering visiting their cousin and the financial planning involved, Speaker B's emotional connection with Sweden, and the financial challenges related to visiting provide a comprehensive background. This builds a helpful context around both the trip planning and their personal connections to Sweden, enabling Speaker B to construct relevant and connected responses. However, the information about Speaker B missing Sweden and the financial constraints could be more directly related or causation could be clearer, which is why the score is not a perfect 5."
