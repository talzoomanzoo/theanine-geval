Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast. Speaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class and enjoys it.\n2. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts.\n3. Both Speaker A and Speaker B are interested in martial arts and enjoy learning new things.\n4. Speaker A is a martial arts teacher and student and is pursuing an athletic training degree in college.\n5. Speaker A is a college student who teaches jiu-jitsu and is lactose intolerant.\n6. Speaker B is busy debugging software and is a runner.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information, but it is not highly relevant or fully connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY notes that Speaker A enjoys martial arts classes and is a martial arts teacher, which aligns with Speaker A's enjoyment of the class mentioned in the context. Additionally, the MEMORY indicates that Speaker B is involved in software work, which relates to Speaker B working on a project at home, as mentioned in the context. However, some details, such as Speaker A's athletic training degree and lactose intolerance, or Speaker B signing up for an online history class and being a runner, do not clearly connect to the current discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY would be more helpful if it focused on shared elements, like both speakers' interests in martial arts, as mentioned in memory point 3, but with more context-related details to assist generating appropriate responses."
