Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think? Speaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons Speaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\n2. Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father.\n3. Speaker A works at a coffee shop and is saving up for their next tattoo.\n4. Speaker A works at a coffee shop that their mom owned.\n5. Speaker B enjoys fishing and wishes their wife and sons could have joined them on the trip.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B have a conversation about their personal interests and trips they have taken for work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I hadn't thought about adding their birth dates, that's a nice touch. I'll definitely take my time to pick the right font, thanks for the suggestion.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information about Speaker A's interest in tattoos, which is relevant since the DIALOGUE CONTEXT discusses getting a tattoo in honor of parents. Specifically, Memory 1 and 2 offer context about Speaker A's existing tattoos and their motivation. Memory 4 further connects to the context as it highlights a familial aspect of Speaker A's life. However, Memories 3, 5, and 6 do not contribute significantly to the tattoo discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, and Memory 6 lacks specificity. Overall, the MEMORY partially supports generating a relevant response, but only some elements are directly helpful."
