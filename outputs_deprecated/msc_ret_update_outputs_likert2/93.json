Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing? Speaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from? Speaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there. Speaker B: That's great. I have gotten my pets from the shelter and they seem happy I brought them home. I have a hard time saying no to them which is why I have so many pets. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs. Do you have a name in mind for your cat?  Speaker A: I've thought of a lot of  names, but in the end it will probably depend on the breed and the sex.   Speaker B: That's true. Is pilates hard? I've always wanted to try it but I don't know if it will be too difficult.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions.\n2. Both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy the company of their pets and think they are smart and playful.\n3. Speaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals, discovered love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets.\n4. Speaker B has 5 dogs of different breeds and has rats as pets but didn't include them in the portrait.\n5. Speaker A prefers adopting pets from shelters rather than from breeders.\n6. Speaker A is interested in getting a dog and likes Akitas.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Pilates can be challenging at first, but it's a great way to improve flexibility and core strength. You should give it a try! Plus, imagine how entertaining it would be if your pets decided to join in on your pilates sessions.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that can support Speaker A in generating an appropriate next response. Specifically, it offers details about pet preferences and the background of pet adoption, which can be useful given the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about pets and adopting a new cat. However, the connection between the sentences in the MEMORY is not completely clear and requires some inference to establish their relevancy to the conversation. For example, some specific details about Speaker B's painting preferences and experiences were mentioned, which could be tangentially related but aren't directly connected to the current dialogue or the potential follow-up questions or responses about pet care, adoption choices, or naming a cat. More clarity about the relevance of each sentence to the ongoing dialogue would improve the MEMORY's helpfulness."
