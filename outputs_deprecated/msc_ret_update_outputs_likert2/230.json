Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet?  Speaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A suggested the name Zhao for one of the kittens.\n2. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n3. Speaker B has an older mellow cat and is concerned about training the new energetic kittens.\n4. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n5. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n6. Speaker B lives in the city they grew up in, loves animals, and has a cat that recently had a kitten.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I think Oreo is a cute name! It suits her coloring perfectly. Have you thought of names for the other kittens yet?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some potentially relevant information related to the naming of the kittens, mainly in sentence 2, where Speaker B is considering giving the kittens Mandarin names. This provides context to their current thought process regarding naming one Oreo and shows a consideration of names based on personalities. However, the connection between the facts in the MEMORY is not very strong or explicitly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences about Speaker A having a parrot and considering adopting a kitten do not directly contribute to the immediate dialogue about naming. Additionally, other memory details about the older mellow cat and adoption paperwork are not directly useful for determining a name for the kittens. Overall, while MEMORY does contain relevant points, the relevancy and causal connections could be stronger."
