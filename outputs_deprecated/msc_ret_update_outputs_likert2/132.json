Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n2. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n3. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n4. Speaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\n5. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n6. Speaker A believes in the importance of giving back and helping youth access resources.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I haven't spoken to my advisor yet, but teaching does seem like a great option for me. I enjoy sharing knowledge and helping others learn, so becoming a college professor in linguistics could be a rewarding path for me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides several pieces of information that are relevant to generating a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT:\n\n1. Sentences 1 and 2 give insight into Speaker B's academic path and career considerations, which align with the conversation about career options, particularly in teaching.\n2. Sentence 4 details Speaker B's volunteering experience, hinting at an inclination towards educational activities, which is pertinent when discussing teaching.\n3. Sentences 5 and 6 discuss both speakers' views on education, which supports the conversation about teaching as a viable career path.\n4. Sentence 3, although related to Speaker A, helps emphasize the common interest in teaching discussed in the dialogue.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY includes relevant information about career considerations, educational values, and specific experiences, effectively supporting a meaningful continuation of the dialogue about career options. However, some sentences like Sentence 3 are less directly connected to Speaker B's career path, preventing a perfect score."
