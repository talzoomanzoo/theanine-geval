Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\n2. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n3. Speaker B is considering giving up their night job to focus on lab work and school.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the challenges and rewards of having a dog with hearing issues.\n6. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could help generate a response in the context of Speaker A's question about working in the lab when cloning a cow. Specifically, it mentions Speaker B's current involvement in the lab and their plans to focus more on it (especially points 2 and 3). However, while there is useful information regarding Speaker Bâ€™s background and work priorities (i.e., majoring in molecular biology, working in a research lab), other parts of the MEMORY (like points 4, 5, and 6) don't directly relate to cloning a cow or the lab work context, providing minimal relevance for crafting a response specific to the current dialogue context. Furthermore, while the connections and developments between past interactions are partially evident, they could be more directly connected to the current context for higher usefulness."
