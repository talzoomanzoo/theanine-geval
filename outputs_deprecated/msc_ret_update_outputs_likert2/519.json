Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is waiting for bands to announce their summer tour schedule to plan which shows to attend.\n2. Speaker A is interested in music concerts and planning a trip to Sao Paulo.\n3.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some potentially relevant information regarding music concerts which could be useful for Speaker B to generate a response. Specifically, memories #1 and #5 suggest that Speaker B is interested in live music and is waiting for bands to announce their summer tours. However, this information doesn't provide a clear answer to Speaker A's question about the date of Speaker B's first music concert. The other memories regarding Speaker A's interests and plans for a trip don't seem directly relevant to the dialogue context about the music concert. Additionally, the memories are somewhat disjointed and lack a clear connection or causality with the specific topic of a specific concert date. Therefore, the helpfulness is limited."
