Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing?

    "raw_prediction": "I'd be more than happy to share my knowledge of Greek mythology with you! It's truly fascinating once you dive into it. And hey, brown hair can be just as fun! Maybe we can plan a trip to Greece together and explore all the historical sites and mythology together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It details Speaker B's interest in Greek mythology and their past travel experiences, which aligns with the conversation about trips to Greece and the shared interest in mythology with Speaker A. It also mentions Speaker A's planning to travel to Italy and their interest in history, which is consistent with the conversation's context of travel and historical interests. The sentences within MEMORY are connected naturally, offering a clear causality and relevancy to the conversation, though some additional specifics could further enhance its helpfulness."
