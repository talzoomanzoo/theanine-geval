Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you. Speaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them Speaker A: IN MY HOME?! A TREE? That was not at all what I was thinking. Do they grow well indoors? I am intrigued. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing.\n2. Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden.\n3. Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more.\n4. Speaker A jokes about space weeds and expresses a desire to see space.\n5. Speaker A plays the clarinet in a band concert and has a solar investment for their office building.\n6. Speaker A's parents are teachers.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Plum and pear trees can be grown in containers indoors, but they do require a lot of sunlight. If you're up for the challenge, it could be a unique and rewarding addition to your indoor garden!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about Speaker A and Speaker B, such as Speaker A's struggles with gardening and interest in space plants, which may loosely relate to the topic of gardening in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the mention of Speaker B's gardening knowledge establishes some relevance. However, many sentences in the MEMORY are not directly connected or relevant to the current conversation about indoor gardening and do not clearly demonstrate causality or relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, information about weight gain, playing the clarinet, and solar investments do not provide any useful context for generating the next response in the conversation. Therefore, while there are small pieces of information that could be helpful, the overall cohesion and relevance to the provided conversation are limited."
