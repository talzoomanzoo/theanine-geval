Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin! Speaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name?  Speaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls!  Speaker B: I see what you meant. Plus the color is beautiful orange. I want to see them together, even I am not a cat person they must be cute together at that time. Once the kitten grows up, situation gonna change to me. How are they, they are doing well? Speaker A: Marmalade is orange too but this is better because the baby is sassy and climbs up my leg to sit on my shoulder. I don't understand how you are not a cat person when you have such a large heart for stray kittens. Speaker B: hehe you're right. But i can't explain that why I am not a cat person to you sorry. How's the weather like today, still good weather to have iced tea out there? Speaker A: It's beautiful. I'm sitting outside while the Spice Girls are chasing bugs in the grass. What did your kids name your cats? Speaker B: ohh so nice sounds like you are enjoying the weather. Still we are discussing about that. Did not name them yet. Also I want to put them back since I am not a big fan of cat Speaker A: That would be cruel to do. You need to rehome them properly or otherwise someone may report you to the authorities for animal abuse. My heart is breaking for your poor cats.  Speaker B: Thank you for concerning. I am trying to be nice to them do not worry \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Marmalade.\n2. Speaker B is not a cat person but ends up taking care of stray cats brought home by kids.\n3. Speaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten.\n4. Speaker A usually leaves their cats with a friend while traveling.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B have a light-hearted and humorous conversation about their pets and travels.\n6. Speaker B loves dogs.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad to hear that you're trying to be nice to them, even if cats aren't your favorite. It's important to give them a good home and take care of them properly. Maybe one day you'll become a cat person after all!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY does provide some useful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It sets a foundation that Speaker A has cats, including one named Ginger, and the intention to name the new kitten Marmalade initially before switching to Pumpkin. The MEMORY also highlights that Speaker B is not a cat person, but takes care of stray cats brought home by the kids, which aligns with the dialogue about Speaker B potentially putting back the cats. However, some sentences in the MEMORY are less connected to the context, such as Speaker A usually leaving their cats with a friend while traveling and Speaker B loves dogs, which do not directly contribute to the flow of conversation or possible future responses. There is an opportunity for more cohesive and causality-based information being included to enhance helpfulness further."
