Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet?  Speaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name? Speaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended.  Speaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along! Speaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them. Speaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me! Speaker A: Hahaha. Yes I agree its too hot to get a long hike in. I've been on some short ones, but the bugs eat me alive. I like to hike in the fall when the bugs are dying off and its a little cooler. Speaker B: Ah yes, that's my favorite time of year. Oh and speaking of Tasha, I'm still amazed she knows Mandarin. Have you been learning more of the language? Speaker A: I've been learning a little more. I try to learn a few things a day. Tasha's reactions to my talking to myself in Mandarin is funny, she looks confused most of the time. Speaker B: That is funny. And impressive that you're learning. The closest I can get to another language is doing a bad New York accent LOL Speaker A: I can't wait to go to New York and hear that accent. It's a great accent, always makes me laugh a little though.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n2. Speaker B finds it amusing that Tasha speaks Mandarin and mutters things under her breath.\n3. Speaker A has been learning Mandarin and Tasha has started saying Chinese phrases instead of English ones.\n4. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n5. Speaker A's parrot Tasha has seen cats before and ignores them.\n6. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Haha, I'll have to practice my accent just for you then! Maybe I can teach one of the kittens to meow in a New York accent too.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could assist in generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker A's parrot named Tasha and their interest in adopting a rescue kitten, which is relevant to the conversation about adopting kittens and potential interactions with the parrot. However, the MEMORY has a slight inconsistency where it indicates that Tasha speaks Mandarin and mutters, though in the context it is Speaker B who finds it amusing that Tasha \"knows\" Mandarin. Furthermore, the MEMORY mentions Speaker B filling out adoption paperwork and considering Mandarin names for kittens, which isn't supported by the dialogue. Overall, while the MEMORY contains relevant pieces, the sentences are not as naturally connected or detailed in demonstrating causality and relevance, hence the score is moderated."
