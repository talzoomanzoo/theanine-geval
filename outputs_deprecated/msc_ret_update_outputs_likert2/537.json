Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies! Speaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?   Speaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere! Speaker B: You have a point.  It is nice to see puppies wagging their tail and just following you!  Changing topics, do you have any recipes with asparagus?  You know, it's such a popular vegetable, but I just don't know how to prepare it. Speaker A: I don't have recipes but I know how to make a good grilled asparagus. Are you looking to bolster your chef book? Speaker B: I sure am!  Grilled asparagus does sound good.  Do you pair the grilled asparagus with your fajitas?  What do you prefer, chicken or beef fajitas? Speaker A: I prefer chicken to beef. I pair it with beef fajitas andI think it's great to have with a glass of merlot. Do you like wine? Speaker B: You're making me hungry!  Yes, I do love wine.  As a matter of fact, I used to live in the Bordeaux region in France, so my favorite wine is Bordeaux wine.  But I also love champagne and cognac.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys cooking, especially making fajitas, and also volunteers at animal shelters.\n2. Speaker A enjoys grilling indoors and suggests grilled asparagus with lemon on it.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B are excited about the idea of traveling the world and trying different cuisines.\n4. Speaker A is more interested in science than music, while Speaker B enjoys listening to Black Sabbath and grilling meat.\n5. Speaker A mainly cares for dogs at the animal shelter, but also cats, and loves when new puppies are brought in.\n6. Speaker B is interested in becoming a chef but hasn't had the time to apply for jobs.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could help in generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it's not highly cohesive or sufficiently detailed. Here is an analysis:\n\n1. **Cooking and Grilling**: Memory points 1 and 2 are somewhat helpful. Speaker A volunteers at animal shelters, enjoys cooking, especially making fajitas, and suggests grilled asparagus with lemon. Memory point 2's mention of grilling matches with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT's mention of grilled asparagus and fajitas, which can help inform culinary-related dialogue exchanges.\n\n2. **Animal Shelters**: Memory point 5 provides minimal helpfulness as it mentions Speaker A's love for caring for animals (a subject touched on in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT) and specifically mentions dogs and cats, linking to the initial part of the context dialogue about the new shelter cat. But the context does not indicate the significance of new puppies being brought in, so this memory doesn't offer new, relevant information for the ongoing conversation.\n\n3. **Travelling and Cuisines**: Memory point 3 could build on a conversation about cuisines, but there's no direct integration since the DIALOGUE CONTEXT doesn't dive into travel or the excitement around different cuisines, so it's mostly irrelevant here.\n\n4. **Careers and Music Preferences**: Points 4 and 6 donâ€™t have direct relevance to the conversation at hand. They talk about interests in science, music preferences, and Speaker B's desire to become a chef, none of which connect directly to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nOverall, while there are facets of the MEMORY that could be incrementally useful, such as cooking and animal care, much of it lacks direct cohesion and relevance to the current conversation trajectory, thereby falling short of maximizing its usefulness for future dialogue generation."
