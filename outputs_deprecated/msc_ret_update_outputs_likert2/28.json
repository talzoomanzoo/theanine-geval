Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting! Speaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow? Speaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from. Speaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same. Speaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal. Speaker B: That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab! Speaker A: Oh! I did not know that. Well if you can clone cows that's more ice cream for you! Haha. What's your favorite ice cream flavor?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n2. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n4. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n5. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n6. Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly regarding Speaker B's involvement in lab work and their interest in molecular biology and neuroscience (points 3, 4, and 6). These aspects are connected to the topic of cloning discussed in the dialogue. However, many of the memory items do not directly relate to the conversation at hand, such as Speaker B's chili dog casserole invention (point 1) or the specific toppings on their hamburger (point 5). Hence, while MEMORY contains some useful background context, many items do not significantly aid in generating a response for the current dialogue, resulting in a mid-range score."
