Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice.  Speaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with? Speaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think? Speaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point. Speaker A: Yes, it contains eggs.  I think you would do well with the fried rice. It's best to cook the rice the day before.   Speaker B: I didn't know that. Why cook the rice beforehand? Is it better to age rice or something? Speaker A: The rice needs to be cool before adding to the pan.  Are you able to take a passenger along in you truck? Speaker B: Oh! That makes since. I didn't realize that the temperature made a difference when frying rice. As for the truck, Yes I can. But, depending on what company I'm working for at the time, they often set restrictions on passengers. Speaker A: The rice tends to stick together if it's warm.  I would like to ride along with you sometime when you're able.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker.\n2. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n3. Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work.\n4. Speaker A recommends the pressure cooker for its efficiency and ease of use, suggesting it to Speaker B.\n5. Speaker B lives in a rural area with a farm and can relate to cooking.\n6. Speaker A is interested in running a business with their cooking skills.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That would be fantastic! I'll let you know when I have a free spot for a passenger. It would be great to have some company on the road, especially if we can chat about cooking and recipes along the way.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides moderately helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It reveals that Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning, which aligns with the ongoing conversation about beginner recipes. Knowing that Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys Asian food is relevant, as the context involves an Asian dish. Similarly, Speaker A's cooking experience and suggestion of using a pressure cooker help contextualize the recommendation. However, some details like Speaker B living in a rural area, owning a farm, and Speaker A's business interest are not directly connected to the conversation about shrimp fried rice and may not be immediately beneficial for the next response. The causality and relevance of the events are not strongly demonstrated across all points in MEMORY, leading to a middle-ground score."
