Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden. Speaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways? Speaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there? Speaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot.  Speaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden? Speaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n4. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n5. Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n6. Speaker B recommends checking out the volcanoes in Sweden for a unique experience.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a fantastic plan for next summer! I hope you get to revisit all your favorite beach spots and create more wonderful memories in Sweden.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains several relevant points that could potentially assist Speaker A in response generation. Specifically, points 1, 2, 3, and 4 provide context about Speaker A and Speaker B's connections to Sweden and their travel considerations. These points establish Speaker A's interest in visiting Sweden and their cousin, as well as Speaker B's fondness for the country. However, some information in the MEMORY is either inaccurate or less relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, point 1 suggests that Speaker A and B have a joint travel plan, which is not indicated in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, and point 6 about the volcanoes in Sweden seems irrelevant as it does not connect with the conversation, considering the geographic inaccuracy. Overall, while MEMORY contains some useful information, its helpfulness is somewhat reduced by the inaccuracies and information that doesn't enhance the dialogue in context."
