    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes.  Speaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me. Speaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n2. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly.\n3. Speaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n4. Speaker A hears raccoons and cats fighting in their neighborhood.\n5. Speaker A is worried about the raccoon potentially eating the bearded dragon.\n6. Speaker A is interested in animals, specifically raccoons and bearded dragons.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I understand your concern. It's important to keep your home and pets safe. Hopefully, with the aluminum sheeting in place, you won't have to worry about unwanted visitors. Just keep an eye out for any signs of raccoons trying to get in.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides a mix of relevant and less relevant information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Here's the breakdown:\n1. Sentence 1 is highly relevant as it directly connects to Speaker A's current action of installing aluminum sheeting to deal with the raccoon problem.\n2. Sentence 2 adds context to Speaker B's perspective on raccoons, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B suggests befriending raccoons.\n3. Sentence 3 provides background on Speaker B's experience with raccoons, specifically their interest in training, which can explain Speaker B's suggestion in the context.\n4. Sentences 4 and 5, however, do not seem strongly connected to the current dialogue and may provide excessive or unrelated details, diminishing the usefulness of this memory.\n5. Sentence 6 offers some insight into Speaker A's interests, but it's not directly relevant to the immediate context of their conversation about raccoon issues.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY contains elements that help develop the context but also includes extraneous information that doesn't directly aid in generating the next response."
