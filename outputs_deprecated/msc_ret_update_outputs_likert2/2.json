Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet? Speaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there? Speaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n2. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n3. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\n4. Speaker B received a new car from their mom and plans to drive during spring break.\n5. Speaker A is worried about gas mileage and asks about the fuel efficiency of Speaker B's car.\n6. Both Speaker A's mother and Speaker A were librarians, but Speaker A is retired.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about Speaker B's excitement for spring break and their new car, which may indirectly relate to their travel plans. However, the details about Speaker A's background and concerns about fuel efficiency are not clearly connected to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about plane tickets and a trip to Costa Rica. The sentences in the MEMORY are somewhat disjointed and do not establish a clear causality or relevance to the ongoing conversation about travel plans and destinations. The information could be more helpful if it directly addressed the immediate context of the dialogue, such as more details about the Costa Rica trip or relevant past interactions between the speakers related to travel."
