Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job. Speaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career. Speaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday. Speaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud. Speaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach? Speaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n3. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n4. Speaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\n5. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n6. Speaker B lives with their mom and is currently in college.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! English and history are fascinating subjects to teach. It's wonderful to see your interests expanding. Have you considered combining linguistics with history in your teaching career? It could offer a unique perspective and open up more opportunities for you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information, but not all of it is directly helpful for generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The first item in the MEMORY is directly relevant because it ties into Speaker A's interest in teaching robotics, which aligns with the conversation's topic about teaching careers. The third item is partially relevant, as it gives insight into Speaker B's current field of study, which slightly connects to their consideration of teaching English or history. Additionally, the fifth item offers background on their shared value for education, which is somewhat useful for conversational context.\n\nHowever, points 2, 4, and 6, while informative about Speaker B's personal life, do not directly contribute to the development of the conversation about teaching careers. The causality and relevancy between the MEMORY and the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT aren't completely clear in these details, which is why this MEMORY doesn't score higher. Furthermore, some sentences could be structured more naturally to demonstrate clearer connections between past interactions and the present dialogue."
