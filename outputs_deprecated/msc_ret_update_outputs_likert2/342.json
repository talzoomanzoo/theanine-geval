Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it! Thank you for the recommendation. Speaker B: Of course. I recommend that movie to everyone I meet. I think I've watched it over one hundred times. So what is the next movie on your list to watch soon? Speaker A: Yeah it was great and I will also recommend to people when they ask what movie is good. So next is another one you recommended which is coming to America. What’s the next movie your going to watch?  Speaker B: There is a horror genre movie that was released just this week which I'm going to watch tonight. It is called \"Girl Next.\" Speaker A: Oh that sounds interesting, I will look into that and put it on my list. How has your job been going? Is there where you get all these great ideas for what to watch?   Speaker B: My Film Studies professor job has been going absolutely great lately. I love all my students, because they really get into the lectures and ask lots of questions. Yes, my job requires me to watch movies all the time, so that is how I find the best ones. Is your programmer job going all right lately? Speaker A: That sounds amazing. Super lucky to have students that really enjoy what they are learning about and I’m sure that’s down to the way you teach and what you teach them. I’m so glad it is all going well for you. Yeah it is going much better now, I’m really getting in the swing of things thank you for asking.  Speaker B: You're welcome. So, returning to the subject of Pulp Fiction, did you think it was funny? Did you think it was too violent for kids to watch?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in watching movies, mentioned Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman.\n2. Speaker B is knowledgeable about movies and provides recommendations based on Speaker A's preferences.\n3. Speaker B used to teach Film Studies and carefully chooses what movies to watch.\n4. Speaker A relies on Speaker B for movie suggestions, mentioning a preference for comedies.\n5. Speaker B enjoys watching suspense films, action, SF, horror, westerns, drama, and occasional good comedy.\n6. Speaker B has kids and enjoys watching movies with them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I found Pulp Fiction to be both funny and intense. The dialogue and characters were so engaging, but yeah, I definitely wouldn't recommend it for kids. The violence and mature themes are pretty heavy. What do you think about that balance in movies, especially when watching with your kids?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that can help in generating a proper response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Points 1, 2, and 3 in MEMORY are helpful because they mention Speaker A's interest in movies, Speaker B's knowledge and recommendation of movies, and Speaker B's background in Film Studies. These details align well with the conversation about movie recommendations and Speaker B's Film Studies professor job discussed in the dialogue.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY also contains sentences that are less directly connected to the immediate context of the conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, point 4 about Speaker A's preference for comedies is not mentioned in the dialogue and doesn't directly help with generating a response to the current topics of discussion. Similarly, the details in points 5 and 6 about Speaker B's personal interests and family are not directly used in the exchange.\n\nOverall, while parts of MEMORY are relevant and potentially helpful, the connection and relevance of other parts to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT are limited."
