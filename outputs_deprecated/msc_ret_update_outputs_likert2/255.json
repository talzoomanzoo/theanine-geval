Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you? Speaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses. Speaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set? Speaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up. Speaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\n2. Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them.\n3. Speaker A also likes mid-century design and is a fan of horror movies.\n4. Speaker A prefers classic horror movies like Halloween or Friday the 13th over modern ones.\n5. Speaker B has a government job that pays the bills but wishes they could work in interior design.\n6. Speaker B's dad works on smaller projects and has never been involved in a major Hollywood film.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Movie blood can be made from a variety of ingredients like corn syrup, food coloring, and sometimes even chocolate syrup for a more realistic look. My favorite recipe includes corn syrup, red food coloring, and a touch of cocoa powder for texture. It's quite fun experimenting with different mixtures to get the perfect blood consistency for each scene.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a next response, particularly regarding Speaker B's involvement in producing horror movies (point 1) and their dad's participation in smaller projects (point 6). However, several points in the MEMORY pertain more to Speaker A (points 2, 3, and 4) and are less relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on Speaker B's experiences and preferences. Additionally, the MEMORY lacks some explicit connections or developments arising directly from the ongoing conversation, such as more details about film production or specific reactions or interactions related to filmmaking. Overall, while there is relevant information in the MEMORY, it could benefit from clearer connections and more focused content on Speaker B's role and experiences in filmmaking."
