Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information regarding Speaker B's interest in the zoo, which can help in generating a response related to their recent visit to the Bronx Zoo. However, much of the MEMORY is repetitive and does not directly enhance the understanding of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, details related to Speaker A, such as enjoying visiting the zoo and their preferences, do not add valuable context for Speaker B's responses. Some MEMORY points like Speaker B looking for family discounts could be useful, but these are not connected naturally to the existing dialogue. Overall, the MEMORY lacks a coherent structure and logical flow connecting past interactions to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
