Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recommends visiting the Parthenon, Acropolis of Athens, and the beach on Corfu Island in Greece.\n2. Speaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian.\n3. Speaker B and their kids are excited about their upcoming trip to Greece.\n4. Speaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five.\n5. Speaker B asks Speaker A if their trip is more for relaxation or sightseeing.\n6. Speaker A hasn't planned their trip out yet but is open to suggestions.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Oh, that's wonderful! The Acropolis in Athens is truly a sight to behold. Make sure to take your time exploring the Parthenon, it's absolutely stunning. The history and architecture there are fascinating. You and your family will have an amazing time exploring all the ancient ruins.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful background information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It reveals that Speaker B has a personal interest in Greece, particularly the Acropolis and Athena, which ties into Speaker A's recent booking of an excursion to the Acropolis. This makes it relevant, as it indicates Speaker B's enthusiasm and possibly comprehensive knowledge about Greece, likely providing Speaker A with useful insights. However, while it establishes Speaker B's excitement about visiting Greece and mentions some specifics like the Parthenon and the beach on Corfu Island, it doesn't directly follow causality or demonstrate connections between each piece of information relevant to the specific current Acropolis excursion to fully aid in generating a next response. Consequently, the MEMORY is moderately helpful but could be more directly connected or contain a direct narrative relating to the Acropolis excursion for a higher score."
