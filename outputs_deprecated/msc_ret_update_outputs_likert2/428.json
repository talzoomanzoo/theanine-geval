Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing? Speaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha! Speaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes? Speaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe.  Speaker A: You make them sounds so fascinating. Will you take them with you to your college dorm?  Speaker B: I'll be living off campus, so absolutely. How about you? Are you staying in the dorms?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel.\n2. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans.\n3. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n4. Speaker B goes to Hawaii for scuba diving and is considering studying marine life or a different type of animal.\n5. Speaker B has an interest in diving and is planning to take neuroscience classes using the GI Bill.\n6. Speaker A is interested in scuba diving and neuroscience, with experience in a research lab.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I agree, snakes are truly fascinating creatures! And that's great that you'll be able to bring them with you. I'll actually be staying off campus as well, so no dorm life for me either. It's nice to have a bit more freedom and space.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY partially aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and provides some helpful information for generating a response. It correctly identifies that Speaker B has two pet snakes, which connects to the dialogue about the snakes and their maintenance. However, much of the MEMORY is not directly relevant to the specific conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as details about scuba diving and Speaker A's volunteering at a lab. While these points show Speaker Bâ€™s broader interests and future plans, they do not clearly contribute to the specific context of discussing the snakes, their maintenance, or if Speaker B will take them to college. The information is somewhat disjointed and does not strongly demonstrate causality or relevancy to the immediate dialogue, thereby providing limited support for generating the next response."
