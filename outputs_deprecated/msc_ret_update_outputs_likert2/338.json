Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information about the ongoing conversation but lacks a complete connection to the specific dialogue context provided. Here's the breakdown:\n- The MEMORY provides context on Speaker A's interest in movies and mentions Pulp Fiction (line 1), which is directly related to the dialogue context.\n- It highlights Speaker B's expertise in movie recommendations (line 2), which also aligns with the context.\n- The MEMORY mentions Speaker B's interest in various movie genres, including horror (line 3), which relates to Speaker B mentioning a horror movie they plan to watch. However, it doesn't mention the specific horror movie, \"Girl Next,\" which would enhance the relevance.\n- The MEMORY (line 4) inaccurately suggests Speaker A watched \"Coming to America,\" conflicting with the context where Speaker A states they plan to watch it next.\n- Line 5 indicates Speaker A's reliance on Speaker B for recommendations and a preference for comedies, but this particular context focuses more on mutual recommendations rather than of comedy-specific interest.\n- Line 6 is relevant in suggesting Eddie Murphy movies which aligns with the theme of film preference and recommendations background but isn't directly linked to the current context.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY is moderately helpful, providing a set of Speaker A and B preferences and past recommendations, but could be improved by more accurately reflecting the immediate context of the conversation."
