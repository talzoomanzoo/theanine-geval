Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it! Thank you for the recommendation.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in watching movies, mentioned Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman.\n2.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides pertinent information that can help Speaker B generate a fitting response in the dialogue context. Specifically, it highlights that Speaker A is interested in movies and trusts Speaker B's recommendations, which ties directly into the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A thanks Speaker B for recommending \"Pulp Fiction.\" Furthermore, it notes that Speaker B has a background in Film Studies and is knowledgeable about movies, which supports the role that Speaker B should play in offering well-informed film recommendations. While the MEMORY provides ample relevant details about their past interactions, the addition of some causal or sequential connections between these details might further enhance its helpfulness."
