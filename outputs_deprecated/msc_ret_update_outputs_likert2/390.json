Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n2. Speaker A hears raccoons and cats fighting in their neighborhood.\n3. Speaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n4. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly.\n5. Speaker A is worried about the raccoon potentially eating the bearded dragon.\n6. Speaker A is interested in animals, specifically raccoons and bearded dragons.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a good amount of relevant information for generating the next response in the dialogue context. The memory indicates that Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem, which directly aligns with the current dialogue context, where Speaker A discusses using aluminum sheeting to tackle this issue. Additionally, it contains relevant information about Speaker B's interest and experience with raccoons, which could inform Speaker B's response in the conversation, especially if they offer advice or insights based on their experience. Memory points about Speaker A's concerns (potential danger to a bearded dragon) and interest in animals can enrich the conversation and give context for responses. However, some memory points about fighting animals and caring for raccoons could be better connected to the dialogue context, limiting the score."
