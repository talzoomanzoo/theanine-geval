Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company? Do you build computers or work on programming? Speaker B: I do like my job. My job is to troubleshoot issues between the hardware and software, so I get to work with both.

How long have you worked for your company? Speaker B: For about four years. It's an industry in flux which is stressful. I need stability for my family at this point. It has changed my focus, which I'm not used to yet. Are you considering any other options for work? Speaker A: Yes I am considering going back to school for dentistry. I am trying to get grants for the money I need. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is considering going back to school for dentistry in the future.\n2.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that could be useful for Speaker B to generate a response in the dialogue context. For instance, memory items 1, 2, and 3 relate to Speaker A's career considerations and align well with Speaker B's inquiry about whether Speaker A is considering other work options. Additionally, memory item 4 highlights Speaker B's current situation about career stability, which connects to the context where Speaker B discusses needing stability for the family.\n\nHowever, memory item 5 does not have a clear connection or causality with the current dialog context. The inclusion of Speaker B's mother being a dentist seems unrelated as there is no previous mention in the dialogue of any family connections to dentistry that would have been relevant to the conversation. Memory item 6 slightly supports the context but could be seen as an extension of item 1. \n\nOverall, while there are relevant pieces that could help generate potential responses, the memory could be better optimized for clarity and relevance, especially in creating a natural, flowing dialogue."
