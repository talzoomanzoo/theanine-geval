Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it? Speaker B: Yes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recommends visiting the Parthenon, Acropolis of Athens, and the beach on Corfu Island in Greece.\n2. Speaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian.\n3. Speaker B and their kids are excited about their upcoming trip to Greece.\n4. Speaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five.\n5. Speaker B's favorite Greek god/goddess is Athena.\n6. Speaker A has kids and is familiar with Greek mythology.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds amazing! I can't wait to explore the Acropolis and learn more about the history and significance of the ancient ruins. Thank you for the tip about visiting the museum first - it will definitely enhance the experience.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about Speaker B's interest and excitement about visiting Greece and relevant background information, such as visiting specific places in Greece, including the Parthenon and Acropolis of Athens, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY could have provided more directly helpful information related to the Acropolis, such as past experiences or specific recommendations directly relevant to enhancing Speaker A's upcoming visit. The connections between the MEMORY sentences and the context are only moderately relevant, as they don't provide much causality or logically structured information that could significantly aid in generating an appropriate next response. While the MEMORY does contain some relevant details, it doesn't fully develop the past interactions or provide deeper insights that could assist in forming a comprehensive and insightful response."
