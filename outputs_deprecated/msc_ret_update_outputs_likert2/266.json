Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam? Speaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A. Speaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now? Speaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n2. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n3. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n4. Speaker B feels overwhelmed by their mother's strictness and is eager to finish school to escape it.\n5. Speaker A advises Speaker B to take breaks and prioritize their own happiness and well-being.\n6. Both speakers value good grades and believe it can lead to better job opportunities.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! Just one more final and then you're free. Make sure to take some time to relax and recharge after that last exam. You deserve it.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains information that is somewhat relevant and could be helpful for Speaker B's response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, elements such as Speaker B being involved in sports medicine, the pressure to maintain good grades because of their mother, and the importance of grades for job opportunities can guide Speaker B's response about their exams and the pressures they might feel. However, the connection between MEMORY contents and the immediate DIALOGUE CONTEXT isn't entirely clear and direct, limiting the coherence in understanding the present conversation. Additionally, some sentences in MEMORY, such as Speaker A excelling in gym, are less relevant to the context where both speakers discuss exams and academic performance. Therefore, while there is some helpfulness in MEMORY, it's not maximally utilized or directly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
