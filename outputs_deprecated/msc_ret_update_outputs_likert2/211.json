Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships! Speaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!   I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field? Speaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate? Speaker B: I have another year- so this year is really important I get internships and start making connections in the field.   I love going to the beach too.  What happened with your knees that now cause you so much pain? Speaker A: I think age has really been my knees downfall. I also used to hike a lot and I put a lot of pressure on my legs. That is great that you only have a year. Maybe when you graduate you can come hang out on the beach with me. I can't surf but I would love to watch you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is offering advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field.\n2. Speaker B is interested in sports medicine and enjoys surfing.\n3. Speaker A suggests that surfing could be a way for Speaker B to make connections in the medical field.\n4. Speaker A enjoys hiking along the coast and collecting shells, mentioning that their knees can't handle much else.\n5. Speaker B is looking for internships in the sports medicine field and has asked professors for letters of recommendation.\n6. Speaker B jokes about pretending to get hurt surfing to meet a doctor, showing a sense of humor and creativity.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate that offer! I'll have to take you up on it once I graduate. Who knows, maybe you'll even see me pretend to wipe out surfing just to meet a doctor, right?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's interest in sports medicine and internships, as well as Speaker A's background and interests. However, some details in the MEMORY, like Speaker B joking about pretending to get hurt, are not present in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making it less directly useful for generating the next response. Additionally, while the mentions of surfing and the medical field are relevant, the connection between these aspects and the rest of the dialogue is not fully clear. Thus, the MEMORY partially aids in generating a proper response but could be better structured to demonstrate clear connections or causality."
