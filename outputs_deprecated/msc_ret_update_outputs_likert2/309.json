Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you. Speaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them Speaker A: IN MY HOME?! A TREE? That was not at all what I was thinking. Do they grow well indoors? I am intrigued.  Speaker B: Well if you want to make it like a proper garden experience then I would suggest going all in, and go for the best most authentic looking items you could get \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing.\n2. Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden.\n3. Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more.\n4. Speaker A jokes about space weeds and expresses a desire to see space.\n5. Speaker A plays the clarinet in a band concert and has a solar investment for their office building.\n6. Speaker A's parents are teachers.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I see what you mean. Maybe I can start with some smaller plants and work my way up to trees. I definitely want that authentic garden experience, just on a slightly smaller scale!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains useful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It helps to establish Speaker A's difficulty with gardening but an interest in unique plant concepts. This information is helpful for understanding why Speaker A might be seeking suggestions from Speaker B and why they might find the idea of unconventional gardening intriguing. Additionally, Speaker B's knowledge in plants and gardening is highlighted, which aligns with the ongoing conversation about gardening suggestions. However, some of the memory points, like Speaker A's musical involvement or their solar investment, are not connected to the context of the garden discussion, which slightly reduces the overall cohesion and relevance of the memory. Nonetheless, the memory points are predominantly relevant and hence the score of 4."
