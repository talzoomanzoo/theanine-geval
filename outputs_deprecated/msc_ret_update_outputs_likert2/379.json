Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\n2. Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father.\n3. Speaker A works at a coffee shop and is saving up for their next tattoo.\n4. Speaker A works at a coffee shop that their mom owned.\n5. Speaker A loves the show Friends and enjoys visiting graffiti-filled places.\n6. Speaker B enjoys fishing and wishes their wife and sons could have joined them on the trip.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's a beautiful idea. Your mom would love that gesture. It's great that you're honoring both your parents with your tattoos.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be helpful for generating a response in the context of discussing a new tattoo for Speaker A's mom. For example, statements 1 and 2 offer insights into Speaker A's tattoo preferences and their emotional significance, which can give context to the new tattoo idea. However, some information, such as details about Speaker A's job (statements 3 and 4) or unrelated hobbies (statements 5 and 6), may not be directly relevant to the current conversation about tattoos, thus reducing the overall helpfulness. The memory could be more focused and directly tied to the tattoo discussion to be rated higher."
