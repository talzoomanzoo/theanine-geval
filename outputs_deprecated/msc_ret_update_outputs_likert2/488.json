Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for. Speaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for? Speaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\n3. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n4. Speaker A plans to bring sandwiches and fruit for the hike, specifically asking about veggie sandwiches for Speaker B.\n5. Speaker A will use the money earned from the store to buy the hammock online.\n6. Speaker B is excited about the idea of swimming in the lake, mentioning they have swum in cold water before.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I've been working part-time at a local coffee shop. It's been pretty fun, and I get to meet a lot of interesting people. But your job sounds great, especially with the hiking trail nearby. You'll have to let me know how it goes once you start!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provided does contain some helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A applying to work at a grocery store, the location being near a hiking trail, and Speaker B having a friend who worked at the same store. These points can help Speaker B generate a more personalized and engaging response when acknowledging Speaker A's excitement about the job. However, there are also details, such as the cross-country journey or bringing sandwiches, which do not directly connect with the current dialogue and may clutter the relevancy. The MEMORY could be more tightly focused on elements directly useful for continuing the conversation, like emphasizing Speaker A's feelings or specific aspects of the store. Additionally, some entries, such as planning to buy a hammock, are relatively unrelated to the immediate conversation's flow. Overall, while parts of the MEMORY are related and helpful, not all details maintain high relevancy or cohesion for the dialogue at hand."
