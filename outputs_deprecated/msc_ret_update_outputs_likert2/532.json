Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies! Speaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?   Speaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mainly cares for dogs at the animal shelter, but also cats, and loves when new puppies are brought in.\n2. Speaker B is interested in volunteering and prefers cats over dogs, especially kittens.\n3. Speaker A dreams of meeting all the puppies from history when they can move through space and time.\n4. Speaker A enjoys cooking, especially making fajitas, and also volunteers at animal shelters.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B are excited about the idea of traveling the world and trying different cuisines.\n6. Speaker A is more interested in science than music, while Speaker B enjoys listening to Black Sabbath and grilling meat.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I see what you mean, puppies do have a special charm with their playful and loyal nature. But I must admit, there's something about the soft purring of a kitten that melts my heart. Each has its unique way of capturing our affections, don't you think?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information that connects well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains information about Speaker A's preference for dogs, especially puppies (#1), which is directly relevant to the conversation about kittens and puppies. Additionally, it mentions that Speaker B prefers cats, especially kittens (#2), which aligns with the question Speaker B asks about the difference between kittens and puppies. These connections provide a clear understanding of the speakers' perspectives, which can help a language model generate a more informed response in the context. Although some information, like Speaker A's dreaming of meeting puppies from history (#3) or their interest in science (#6), is less directly relevant to the current dialogue context, these parts do not significantly detract from the overall helpfulness. Thus, the MEMORY is mostly structured in a way that benefits generating a suitable continuation of the conversation."
