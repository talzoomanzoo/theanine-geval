Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job. Speaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n2. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n3. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n4. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n5. Speaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\n6. Speaker B lives with their mom and is currently in college.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's understandable, deciding on a career path can be overwhelming. Teaching could be a rewarding choice, especially in a field you're passionate about like linguistics. Have you considered looking into teaching opportunities at universities or colleges?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that can help Speaker A generate an appropriate response in the dialogue context. Here's a breakdown of the helpfulness:\n\n1. Sentence 1 is very helpful as it directly relates to Speaker B considering career options in teaching and further educationâ€”aligning with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT regarding career decisions.\n2. Sentence 2 adds context about Speaker B's field of study and perceived job limitations, which could guide Speaker A to suggest more specific career advice.\n3. Sentence 3 offers insights into Speaker A's background, which, although not directly relevant, can support a more personalized conversation between the speakers.\n4. Sentence 4 highlights both speakers' shared value in education, underpinning the career discussion theme.\n5. Sentence 5 provides additional context on Speaker B's activities aligned with education, underpinning potential career choices in teaching.\n6. Sentence 6, while less directly applicable to the immediate context, offers personal background information that may support understanding Speaker B's motivations.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY effectively connects to the themes of career decisions in education and teaching and offers useful, naturally connected insights to support Speaker A in crafting responses."
