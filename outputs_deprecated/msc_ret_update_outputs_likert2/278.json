Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing?

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad to hear your daughter is getting into Greek mythology! It's great to share those interests with the next generation. Also, my blue hair has grown out now. I'm actually heading to a hair appointment for my birthday to decide on a new color.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY is relatively helpful in generating a proper next response for Speaker A based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures key elements of the conversation, such as Speaker A's travel plans and interest in Italy, as well as Speaker B's interest in Greek mythology and their desire to visit Greece. These details are relevant to the ongoing conversation about travel plans and shared interests. \n\nHowever, some information, like Speaker A's fascination with Italian architecture, watching documentaries, and a hair appointment, might not directly relate to the immediate context, which reduces helpfulness slightly. Additionally, certain connections or developments, such as the potential trip to Greece and interests in mythology, could be more explicitly linked to emphasize the causal or relevant connections to the dialogue context. Nonetheless, the MEMORY generally provides a coherent background that supports the conversation topic."
