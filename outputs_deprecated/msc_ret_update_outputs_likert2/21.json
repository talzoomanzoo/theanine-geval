Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun! Speaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim.  Speaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you  Speaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises. Speaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you? Speaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it. Speaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car? Speaker B: Yes, there are several. Hope we could meet and You possibly teach me about computer programming. Speaker A: That would be great too. I like to program in several different languages. Do you have a preference? Speaker B: No, I'm just getting started so I don't have a preference. Maybe you could show me what you prefer and we could start there. Speaker A: Sure. I usually like to start with html and css so we can start there. We'll order some pizzaburgers to help us out. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n2. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n4. Speaker B is interested in learning programming and is already practicing.\n5. Speaker B is looking forward to eating a pizza burger in a pool with punk music playing.\n6. Speaker A enjoys the food and the adventure of cruises.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a tasty way to kick off our programming lessons! Looking forward to diving into HTML and CSS with some delicious pizzaburgers by the pool.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It adequately captures the main points of the conversation between Speaker A and Speaker B, including the offer to teach swimming and programming (1), the interest in punk music (2), the discussion of going on a cruise (3), and Speaker B's interest in programming (4). However, while item 5 captures a playful idea mentioned in the dialogue, it may not be as immediately relevant for generating a response. Overall, the MEMORY is mostly connected and sufficiently demonstrates relevancy and the development of past interactions, which would be helpful for generating the next response."
