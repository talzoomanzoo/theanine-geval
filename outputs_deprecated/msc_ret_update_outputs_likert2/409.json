Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far. Speaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes.  Speaker A: why don't you like books like that? Speaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading? Speaker A: Not yet.  I think Netflix is going to make it into a movie soon.  They might finally convince me to pay for a subscription haha. Speaker B: Well if it's any good I know you'll be watching the whole thing. Speaker A: you know it.  And I know that you would just fall asleep during it whether it's any good or not.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n2. Speaker B is fascinated by animals and can relate to Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals.\n3. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n4. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n5. Speaker A suggests taking naps during quiet times and mentions watching her grandkids.\n6. Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves by using technology or watching TV.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Haha, you caught me! I do tend to doze off during intense dramas. Maybe I should take a page out of your book and consider taking naps during quiet times, just like you do with your grandkids.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information, such as Speaker B's fascination with animals and Speaker A's habit of watching grandkids and Netflix shows. Speaker A's love for intense fiction and Speaker B's preference for animal books slightly align with their discussion theme about reading preferences. However, the memory lacks clear causality or connections to the specific conversation. The records about grandchildren and specific details of TV habits add context but aren't directly aiding this dialogue. The MEMORY would be more helpful if it included more about their book, fiction preferences, or their streaming habits' depth. Furthermore, the sentences are not always naturally connected to form a strong narrative relevant to the current dialogue context."
