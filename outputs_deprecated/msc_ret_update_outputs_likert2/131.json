Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "raw_prediction": "Italian subs are always a good choice! I'm looking forward to trying it out with you after our karate session tomorrow.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information that can be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it mentions Speaker B's involvement in karate and their level (green belt), which aligns with the current discussion about martial arts and karate classes. Additionally, Speaker B's background in karate and football could be relevant, as it might inform their recommendation and teaching style. However, the MEMORY also includes less relevant information, such as Speaker B considering IT work, attending football games, and their enjoyment of water-related activities, which are not directly connected to the ongoing conversation. The information about Speaker A's love for seafood, while interesting, does not directly contribute to the dialogue's context of planning for martial arts or dining options tied to the new sandwich shop. Although there are connections within the MEMORY, they are not as strongly linked or causally related to the immediate context of scheduling a karate class or choosing a restaurant. Thus, the MEMORY gets a mid-range score as it could be more tightly aligned with the dialogue's primary focus."
