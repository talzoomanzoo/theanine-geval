Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids? Speaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call! Speaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand. Speaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n2. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n3. Speaker B has grandkids who are more interested in phones and tablets than musical instruments.\n4. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n5. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n6. Speaker B mentions having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's wonderful that you have the opportunity to spend quality time with your grandkids. I've been thinking about it, and I think it could be a great idea to start a tradition like that. It would be a nice change of pace for my own family too.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be helpful for generating a proper next response related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it includes points about Speaker B's interest in making the fishing trip an annual tradition (which directly relates to their mention of the fishing trip in the dialogue) and about Speaker B's experience of taking their grandkids fishing before. It also emphasizes Speaker B's enjoyment of spending time with their grandkids, which ties into the context of having more time to spend with them now. However, points about the grandkids' interest in phones and tablets, or musical instruments, might not closely relate to the immediate conversation about the annual fishing trip. Overall, the memory provides a partial background, but it could be more cohesive and focused on the relevant topics discussed in the dialogue."
