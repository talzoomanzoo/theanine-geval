Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think? Speaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons Speaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use. Speaker B: I am a little scared of needles though. Were your tattoos painful? Speaker A: Most of them were not.  It really depends on where on your body you get them.  Most of mine are on areas that didn't hurt.  The one on my foot and the one behind my ear did hurt a good bit.  Where were you thinking about getting it? Speaker B: I hadn't really thought about it! Maybe upper arm or upper back? But I'm no tattoo expert. And I'd have to get permission from my wife first, LOL Speaker A: Definitely talk to her first.  I had a friend that didn't talk to his wife and just came home with a tattoo one day.  It led to a huge fight - both about the money he spent and not discussing it with her.  He slept on my couch for over a week! Speaker B: Oh no! Yeah, you don't want to spring something like that on your spouse. I don't think you mentioned before, are you married? Speaker A: No.  I haven't found anyone that could deal with me or that I could deal with for more than a few months.  At this point, I have given up on the idea of getting married and want to focus on my artwork.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father.\n2. Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\n3. Speaker A works at a coffee shop and is saving up for their next tattoo.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B have a conversation about their personal interests and trips they have taken for work.\n5. Speaker B enjoys fishing and wishes their wife and sons could have joined them on the trip.\n6. Speaker A works at a coffee shop that their mom owned.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "It's important to prioritize what makes you happy. Relationships aren't for everyone, and focusing on your artwork sounds like a great plan. Your tattoos must hold a lot of personal meaning for you, especially the one dedicated to your father.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, it mentions that Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has one dedicated to their late father, which aligns with the context about getting a new tattoo for their mom to match the one for their dad. This memory is relevant and can help in generating a meaningful response connected to tattoos and their significance for Speaker A.\n\nHowever, many elements in the MEMORY, such as Speaker A working at a coffee shop or Speaker B's interest in fishing, are not relevant to the ongoing dialogue about tattoos, marital status, or relationship assumptions. Moreover, the memory lacks a logical flow or causal link that would naturally lead into the dialogue about the tattoo discussion (e.g., Speaker A's dedication to their father and future plans). It would have been more helpful if the MEMORY elaborated more on Speaker A's views on tattoos or further exploring past interactions about tattoos. Hence, the MEMORY, while containing some relevant points, does not fully serve the criterion of naturally connected events stemming from a past interaction."
