Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself! Speaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food? Speaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too? Speaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also? Speaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways? Speaker B: They've been better as I left my previous job so I'm spending more time with them, how do you manage to work full time and still keep those animals happy? Speaker A: I think working at the zoo so long has helped. Why did you leave your last job. Was that the one you were working in the warehouse? Sorry to hear about your dogs, it can be hard managing older animals. Speaker B: Yea, that totally makes sense! I just wanted time off to spend with the dogs and look for a better job elsewhere, I'm hoping that I'll be able to get a job outside of a warehouse! Speaker A: That is understandable. I didn't always think I would end up a zookeeper. Do you have anything in mind? Speaker B: Well, I really enjoy animals so I might think of applying to work in a zoo aswell! Is it a super busy job? Speaker A: That sounds like a great idea! You would be surprised how busy it can be. Not every job is high demanding and you don't have to work with all the animals either. Is there anything you don't like to do?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A works at a zoo and is willing to help Speaker B get an entry-level position there.\n2. Speaker A mentions that entry-level positions at the zoo involve cleaning enclosures and feeding less dangerous animals but offer decent pay, training, benefits, and assistance with schooling.\n3. Speaker B is looking for a new job and is excited about the opportunity at the zoo.\n4. Speaker A works as a zookeeper and loves animals, especially white tigers.\n5. Speaker A works at a zoo and has tried playing music for the white tigers and home concerts for their pets.\n6. Speaker A mentions having dogs and Speaker B admires them for their peaceful nature.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some helpful information for Speaker B to generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker A's work at the zoo, which aligns with the dialogue where Speaker A discusses working at a zoo and offers insight into the type of work available. This aspect connects Speaker A's and Speaker B's shared interest in zookeeping, making it relevant to the dialogue context. However, the MEMORY also includes some information that is not directly connected to the current dialogue, such as the details about the white tigers and Speaker A's music for them. While these details add background to Speaker A's character, they are not crucial for generating a next response in the current context. Overall, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful as it provides relevant details and insights, but not all information directly supports the continuation of the current conversation."
