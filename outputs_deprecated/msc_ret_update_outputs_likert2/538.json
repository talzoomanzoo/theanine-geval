Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies! Speaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?   Speaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere! Speaker B: You have a point.  It is nice to see puppies wagging their tail and just following you!  Changing topics, do you have any recipes with asparagus?  You know, it's such a popular vegetable, but I just don't know how to prepare it. Speaker A: I don't have recipes but I know how to make a good grilled asparagus. Are you looking to bolster your chef book? Speaker B: I sure am!  Grilled asparagus does sound good.  Do you pair the grilled asparagus with your fajitas?  What do you prefer, chicken or beef fajitas? Speaker A: I prefer chicken to beef. I pair it with beef fajitas andI think it's great to have with a glass of merlot. Do you like wine? Speaker B: You're making me hungry!  Yes, I do love wine.  As a matter of fact, I used to live in the Bordeaux region in France, so my favorite wine is Bordeaux wine.  But I also love champagne and cognac. Speaker A: Haha, I know right? I lived in the Champagne region for a bit! Always wanted to go to Bordeaux. How was it there?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys cooking, especially making fajitas, and also volunteers at animal shelters.\n2. Speaker A enjoys grilling indoors and suggests grilled asparagus with lemon on it.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B are excited about the idea of traveling the world and trying different cuisines.\n4. Speaker A is more interested in science than music, while Speaker B enjoys listening to Black Sabbath and grilling meat.\n5. Speaker A mainly cares for dogs at the animal shelter, but also cats, and loves when new puppies are brought in.\n6. Speaker B is interested in becoming a chef but hasn't had the time to apply for jobs.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Bordeaux was incredible! The vineyards, the wine, the food - everything was just so rich in flavor. You'd absolutely love it there with your passion for cooking and wine. Maybe we can plan a trip there together one day and explore the culinary delights of the region.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant background information that helps to understand the preferences and interests of Speaker A and Speaker B, such as Speaker A's enjoyment of cooking and volunteering at animal shelters (points 1 and 5), and Speaker B's interest in becoming a chef (point 6). These pieces of information could help generate responses to topics related to cooking and animals, which are present in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the details about traveling the world (point 3) and preferences in science vs. music (point 4) are irrelevant to the current context, and there is missing causality among the details because they are presented as disparate facts rather than events or actions relevant to the conversationâ€™s flow. Overall, while there is some helpful information present, the connection and relevance of the MEMORY to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT isn't maximized."
