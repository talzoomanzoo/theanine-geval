Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens? Speaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month Speaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.  Where are you going on vacation? Speaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there! Speaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo? Speaker B: Their zoo is pretty good! It's always crowded, of course, but they have pandas so I'm happy. I would say it's bigger than the DC zoo, but I like that the DC zoo has fewer people. Speaker A: That sounds awesome.  I haven't been to the zoo in so long.  I wish I could go. Speaker B: You should go with your sister! she can bring her dog. They probably have all kinds of exotic birds...\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys seeing pandas and penguins at the zoo and goes with their sister.\n2. Speaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo.\n3. Speaker A has been to the zoo before and enjoys seeing exotic birds.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss hobbies and interests, with Speaker A enjoying gardening and reading, and Speaker B enjoying visiting the zoo.\n5. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend.\n6. Speaker A has a sister who owns a corgi.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's a great idea! My sister's corgi would love to join us, and I bet she'd enjoy seeing all the exotic birds there too. I'll definitely plan a trip to the zoo soon. Thanks for the suggestion!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe memory provides a fair amount of helpful information relevant to the dialogue context. It provides relevant background details, such as Speaker B's interest in adopting a kitten from Speaker A's friend (Memory 5), which aligns with Speaker A's inquiry about the kitten in the dialogue context. It also mentions Speaker B's enjoyment of zoos (Memory 2, 4), which matches the current topic of conversation about visiting the San Diego zoo. \n\nAdditionally, memory mentions Speaker A's sister who owns a corgi (Memory 6), connecting to Speaker B's suggestion to invite the sister and her dog to the zoo. \n\nHowever, some information, like Speaker A's specific interests in pandas (Memory 1) and gardening and reading (Memory 4), or the mention of penguins and exotic birds (Memory 1, 3), is not directly relevant to the current zoo discussion, though it could still be helpful if the conversation were to pivot later.\n\nOverall, the connections between past interactions and the dialogue context are reasonably clear, hence a score of 4."
