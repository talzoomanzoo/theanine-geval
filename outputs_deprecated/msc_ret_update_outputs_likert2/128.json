Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well? Speaker B: I haven't!

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant and potentially useful information for the conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, mentioning Speaker B's background and involvement in karate (points 1 and 2) supports their recommendation of karate classes and suggests they have knowledge and experience to share. The mention of Speaker B's football background and how it relates to karate footwork (point 3) might be useful in the context of a discussion about martial arts techniques.\n\nHowever, other information in the MEMORY is less directly relevant to the immediately ongoing conversation, such as Speaker B's enjoyment of water-related activities and movies (point 4), Speaker A and Speaker B's mutual interest in languages (point 5), and Speaker A's love for seafood (point 6). While these details add more depth to Speaker B's character, they do not contribute significantly to developing or informing the current conversation about martial arts, scheduling dojo visits, or related activities. Additionally, the information, although presented in a structured manner, does not strongly demonstrate causality or a clear link to the immediate context."
