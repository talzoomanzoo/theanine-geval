Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for. Speaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for? Speaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work? Speaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol Speaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise?  Speaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows. Speaker A: That sounds wonderful! You'd get to just be out in nature all day. Sounds like a great job, especially if you're a bit introverted like me. That's why hiking is my favorite -- a good solitary activity.  Speaker B: Yes, I agree. What kind of hours would this new job have? Speaker A: It's third shift, which isn't the greatest, but it pays a bit more than the other shifts, and I think I'll like getting off early in the morning. Then I can just go down and get in my hammock and have a nice relaxing moment after work.  Speaker B: Would you feel safe being out there all alone, possibly falling asleep? That just sounds a bit risky.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking, mentioning setting up a hammock at their campsite.\n3. Speaker B enjoys camping, hiking, and is kind, caring, and hopeful for group equality.\n4. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n5. Speaker A has a portable hammock for the hike and asks if Speaker B will bring theirs.\n6. Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I understand your concern, but I've been camping and hiking for years now, so I feel pretty comfortable being out in nature by myself. Plus, I always make sure to set up my hammock in a safe and secure spot. It's like my own little cozy sanctuary amidst the trees.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some relevant pieces of information connected to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Points 1 and 2 connect to Speaker A's discussion about hiking and using a hammock, and the notion of a job at a grocery store. However, many other items in the MEMORY do not relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT in a significant way. For example, point 3 describes Speaker B's interests and personality traits, but they don't directly enhance the understanding of the current conversation about job prospects. Points 4 and 5 introduce new context about Speaker A that hasn't been mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. These facts could be relevant for other conversations but do not help Speaker A generate the next response in this particular conversation. Point 6 references Speaker B's friend working at the store, which could potentially be relevant but isn't mentioned or expanded upon in the current conversation. Overall, the MEMORY has some relevant insights but lacks a coherent connection and flow regarding the specifics discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
