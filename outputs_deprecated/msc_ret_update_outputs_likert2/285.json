Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice.  Speaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work.\n2. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker.\n3. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n4. Speaker A recommends the pressure cooker for its efficiency and ease of use, suggesting it to Speaker B.\n5. Speaker A has given a pressure cooker as a gift and uses it for recipes like lamb shanks.\n6. Speaker B's husband is a great cook and Speaker B is not skilled in cooking.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I would recommend starting with a simple recipe like a chicken curry or a vegetable stir-fry. Both are delicious and easy to make in a pressure cooker. Plus, they will give you a good feel for using the appliance before moving on to more complex dishes. Enjoy your cooking adventure!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a good amount of helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It indicates that Speaker B's husband is an experienced cook who enjoys making Asian food, which aligns well with Speaker A's suggestion to try Asian recipes. The MEMORY also notes that Speaker B is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker, which is directly connected to Speaker A's recommendation of recipes that can be made using this tool. Additionally, the MEMORY highlights Speaker A's expertise and positive experience with using a pressure cooker, which lends credibility to their advice. However, while the MEMORY connects the past interactions of Speaker A and Speaker B, some pieces of information seem somewhat redundant, such as repeating the fact that Speaker B's husband is a great cook. A more detailed connection or causality between specific events and the current context could enhance the scoring. Overall, the MEMORY is valuable for generating a thoughtful and informed response for Speaker A."
