Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends? Speaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do. Speaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars. Speaker B: Yeah, I think they go dark for a couple months and then have daylight for a couple months! I actually like night time, but having daylight all the time will make me crazy lol. Yeah I kind of hope it's dark for the camping but it will be very cold. I have heard Alaska has delicious ice cream. I want to try that while I'm there,  Speaker A: You'd have to get some serious blackout curtains for when it was daylight lol! You'll have to stock up on some warm essentials before heading out. You definitely don't want to get stuck in a bad situation in the cold, especially if you're alone. I bet they have great ice cream! You'll have to tell me about it when you get back! Speaker B: Yeah, I need to call my friend and find out what season they are in so I can pack accordingly. I will take pictures of the ice cream too so I can tell you about it. I wonder if there are a lot of bears there? I don't like bears either.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mentions the outdoor activities they plan to do in Alaska, such as hiking.\n2. Speaker B is unsure about what else there is to do in Alaska besides hiking.\n3. Speaker A has the impression that Alaska is cold and snowy, wondering if there are ski slopes there.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together.\n5. Speaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet.\n6. Speaker A mentions that Alaska has mountains and glaciers, unsure if skiing is possible there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I think it's a good idea to check with your friend about the season so you can pack appropriately. Bears can be a concern in certain areas of Alaska, but as long as you take the necessary precautions and stay informed about where you are, you should be fine. Just be bear-aware and keep your distance if you happen to encounter any. Remember, safety first!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant context to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT since it involves a trip to Alaska, which is the main theme of the conversation. However, the information in MEMORY lacks clarity and direct connection to the current dialogue. For instance, the MEMORY mentions hiking and skiing, which are not discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where the focus is on sledding with dogs and potential camping. Additionally, the MEMORY references Speaker A and B planning a trip together, while in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, Speaker B plans their trip independently. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it included information on daylight patterns in Alaska or Speaker B's specific interests like ice cream and bears, as mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Furthermore, the sentences within the MEMORY do not provide a clear logical progression or causality that would inform Speaker A's next response effectively."
