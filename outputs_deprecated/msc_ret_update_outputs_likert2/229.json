Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A suggested the name Zhao for one of the kittens.\n2. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n3. Speaker B has an older mellow cat and is concerned about training the new energetic kittens.\n4. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n5. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n6. Speaker B lives in the city they grew up in, loves animals, and has a cat that recently had a kitten.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I've been thinking of naming them based on their personalities. I've decided on Zhao for one of them. What do you think?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY includes several pieces of information that could be helpful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it mentions that Speaker B is considering giving the rescue kittens Mandarin names, which directly relates to Speaker A's question about naming the kittens. This memory is relevant because it can inform Speaker B's response, possibly elaborating on the considerations for naming the kittens.\n\nAdditionally, the information about Speaker B having filled out adoption paperwork and being concerned about integrating the new kittens with their older cat provides context about Speaker B's current situation with the kittens.\n\nHowever, some of the sentences seem less directly connected or relevant to the specific aspect of naming the kittens. For example, Speaker B's love for animals or where they live isn't crucial for the immediate context of naming. Also, details about Speaker A's parrot do not contribute to the naming discussion, even though they provide background on Speaker A's pet interests.\n\nOverall, while there are some relevant parts in MEMORY that can contribute to a rich response, it also contains elements that do not directly aid in answering Speaker A's question, thus not fully maximizing its helpfulness."
