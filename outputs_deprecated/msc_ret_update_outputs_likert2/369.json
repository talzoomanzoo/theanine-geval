Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens? Speaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend.\n2. Speaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo.\n3. Speaker A prefers cockatoos over kittens as pets.\n4. Speaker A is focused on saving money and not planning to have children in the near future.\n5. Speaker B likes poetry and fantasy books, and has a pet cat.\n6. Speaker A has been to the zoo before and enjoys seeing exotic birds.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a good plan. It's important to make sure you have enough time to settle in the new kitten before going away. Plus, it gives you something to look forward to when you get back from your vacation.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that is related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly points 1 and 5, which relate to Speaker B's consideration of adopting a kitten and the fact that Speaker B has a pet cat. However, the remaining pieces of memory, while offering insights into the speakers' preferences and hobbies, do not directly contribute to the development of this particular conversational thread about adopting the kitten. The elements of MEMORY are somewhat disjointed, lacking a clear sense of causality or relevance to the immediate context of discussing the potential adoption of the kitten. Therefore, MEMORY partially fulfills the criterion by providing some context but overall lacks the cohesion and direct relevance to merit a higher score."
