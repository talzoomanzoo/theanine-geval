Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok?  Speaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish? Speaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus! Speaker B: Oh that sounds absolutely fabulous. Are you going to get a free dessert, as well?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n2. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n3. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n4. Speaker B loves the beach and Mediterranean food.\n5. Speaker A's schedule at the restaurant includes working doubles on Saturdays and 8-hour shifts on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.\n6. Speaker A is an omnivore.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I wish! Unfortunately, the free meal only includes an entree and a drink. But hey, I can always bring home some leftover pastries or cakes for dessert.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains several pieces of information that are relevant to Speaker A's excitement about trying a new dish at their workplace restaurant, such as the fact that they work at a restaurant, receive free meals, and enjoy working there despite it being busy. These aspects of the MEMORY contribute context to Speaker A's enthusiasm for trying the dish and sharing it with Speaker B. However, the MEMORY does not directly address or expand on the specific dish mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT (Chicken parmesan with red pepper marinara and sweet roasted asparagus) or concrete past interactions between the speakers about food or restaurant-related topics, which could have been more helpful. The information about Speaker B's interest in Mediterranean food might hint at shared interests, but doesn't directly connect to the current conversation. Overall, while there are relevant points, the lack of direct connection or nuanced past conversation between A and B in MEMORY limits its helpfulness."
