Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet?  Speaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name? Speaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A suggested the name Zhao for one of the kittens.\n2. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n3. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n4. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n5. Speaker B has an older mellow cat and is concerned about training the new energetic kittens.\n6. Speaker A is interested in training tips for the kittens and is open to adopting one despite having a parrot.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that can inform Speaker B's response. It includes details about Speaker B's consideration of giving the kittens Mandarin names based on their personalities, which connects to the ongoing discussion about naming the kittens. Additionally, it presents Speaker A's interest in adopting a rescue kitten and their parrot, which aligns with the dialogue context of adoption mentioned by Speaker A. However, the MEMORY lacks a strong direct relevance or connection to generating the very next response to Speaker A's specific question/comment about the name Oreo. The sentences in the MEMORY are moderately connected and relevant, but they do not demonstrate clear causality or direct development of the interaction, limiting their overall helpfulness."
