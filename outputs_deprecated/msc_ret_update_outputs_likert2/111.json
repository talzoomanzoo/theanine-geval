Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok?  Speaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n2. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n3. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n4. Speaker B loves the beach and Mediterranean food.\n5. Speaker A's schedule at the restaurant includes working doubles on Saturdays and 8-hour shifts on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.\n6. Speaker A enjoys the interaction with people at work and the variety of experiences that come with it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant background information that could be helpful for responding to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, knowing that Speaker A works at a restaurant (points 1, 2, and 3) is directly related to the context where Speaker A talks about their favorite dish being added to the menu at work. The fact that Speaker A can get meals for free (point 3) connects to Speaker A's anticipation of trying the dish for free during their next shift.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY lacks more specific details that might enrich the response, such as the type of restaurant or the kinds of dishes Speaker A typically enjoys, which could help provide a more personalized response. Additionally, some sentences in the MEMORY, like Speaker B's love for the beach and Mediterranean food (point 4), do not seem to actively contribute to advancing the current dialogue or Speaker A's response. While the MEMORY is relevant, it could be better connected and more focused on the specific dialogue at hand."
