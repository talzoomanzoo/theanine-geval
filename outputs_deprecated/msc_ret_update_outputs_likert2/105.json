Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends? Speaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do. Speaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars. Speaker B: Yeah, I think they go dark for a couple months and then have daylight for a couple months! I actually like night time, but having daylight all the time will make me crazy lol. Yeah I kind of hope it's dark for the camping but it will be very cold. I have heard Alaska has delicious ice cream. I want to try that while I'm there,  Speaker A: You'd have to get some serious blackout curtains for when it was daylight lol! You'll have to stock up on some warm essentials before heading out. You definitely don't want to get stuck in a bad situation in the cold, especially if you're alone. I bet they have great ice cream! You'll have to tell me about it when you get back! Speaker B: Yeah, I need to call my friend and find out what season they are in so I can pack accordingly. I will take pictures of the ice cream too so I can tell you about it. I wonder if there are a lot of bears there? I don't like bears either. Speaker A: I'm pretty sure they have grizzlies up there. You better pack something to fend them off too just in case. I bet your friend knows everything you'd need to keep them away.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mentions the outdoor activities they plan to do in Alaska, such as hiking.\n2. Speaker B is unsure about what else there is to do in Alaska besides hiking.\n3. Speaker A has the impression that Alaska is cold and snowy, wondering if there are ski slopes there.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together.\n5. Speaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking.\n6. Speaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'll definitely ask my friend about the bear situation. I'm not keen on any close encounters with them either. It's good to be prepared for anything, especially in the wilderness. I'll make sure to pack some bear spray or something to keep them at a safe distance. Thanks for the heads up about the grizzlies!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context related to an Alaskan trip, but it is mostly fragmented and not directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While it mentions outdoor activities, cold weather, and planning, it lacks specific connections to the detailed activities mentioned in the context, such as dog sledding, camping, the seasonal daylight changes, and bears. The MEMORY does not demonstrate a clear causality or progression of the dialogue. Furthermore, it incorrectly states that Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip together, which is inconsistent with the current dialogue where Speaker B is planning the trip with friends. Consequently, MEMORY does not provide highly helpful information for generating the next response in the dialogue context."
