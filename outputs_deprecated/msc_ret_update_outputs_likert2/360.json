Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week? Speaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you? Speaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions? Speaker B: Unfortunately I mainly play games similar to RE. I don't know why I like them so much. I remember when I was little my brother play Doom and it gave me nightmares for a week. What genre of games you like?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B mentions that Resident Evil can be scary and provides some tips for playing it.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n3. Speaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII.\n4. Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World.\n5. Speaker A prefers tamer video games and is not a fan of horror movies.\n6.

    "raw_prediction": "I prefer more relaxed games like Jurassic Park: World. I like the adventure and exploration aspect of it. It's just more my speed compared to the intense horror of Resident Evil.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some helpful information that is relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it notes that Speaker B mentions Resident Evil can be scary, which coincides with Speaker A's mention of not liking scary video games. Speaker B's enjoyment of video games, specifically horror-themed ones like Resident Evil, aligns with their dialogue in the context. Additionally, Speaker A's preference for tamer games is supported by the memory. However, the memory could be more naturally connected by demonstrating clear causality or development of the conversation over time. There is some lack of context that could further tie Speaker A's and Speaker B's gaming preferences, leading to suggestions for tamer games. Therefore, while there is some relevancy, the memory's helpfulness is limited due to missing specific connections and continuous development for generating the next response."
