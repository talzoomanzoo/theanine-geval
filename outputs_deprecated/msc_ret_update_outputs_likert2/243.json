Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately? Speaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me. Speaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n2. Speaker A is nervous about the Appalachian Trail hike, as they don't usually do full day hikes.\n3. Speaker A leads hikes for the group they camp with, which are usually an hour or two long.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy being outdoors, but Speaker B prefers the fresh air over being in the mud and rain.\n5. Speaker B dislikes bugs and is not a fan of camping, hiking, or the outdoors.\n6. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "They did! I think they enjoyed the change of scenery and fresh air. It's always nice to get out and explore, even if it's not something you do often.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains a mix of relevant and less relevant information for generating a proper next response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Some parts, like point 3, are helpful and directly connected to the context, as Speaker A leading hikes is mentioned in both. However, points like 1 and 5 conflict with each other, as in the memory Speaker B both enjoys hiking and dislikes it, which makes it confusing and less useful. The potential relevance of the Appalachian Trail and camping (points 2 and 6) is not directly connected to the current conversation about the hike Speaker A recently led. Overall, while there are useful pieces, the lack of coherence and relevance in parts of the memory reduces its overall helpfulness."
