Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has grandkids who are more interested in phones and tablets than musical instruments.\n2. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n3. Speaker B mentions having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own.\n4. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n5. Speaker A has children and grandchildren, with at least one child interested in learning the flute.\n6. Speaker A's other children are addicted to tablets and phones, unlike the youngest one who is interested in music.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response. It establishes that Speaker B has grandkids who are more interested in technology than musical instruments, which is relevant to the context of Speaker A asking about technology use with grandkids. It also mentions Speaker B enjoys spending time with their grandkids, which could be used to build a response about technology facilitating or hindering that interaction. However, the MEMORY could be better connected or more causally linked to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT by incorporating specific instances where technology impacted the interactions or activities with the grandkids. Additionally, details about Speaker A’s interest in their kids’ musical preferences could enrich the relevance if tied better to Speaker B’s experiences."
