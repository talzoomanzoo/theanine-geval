Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for. Speaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for? Speaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work? Speaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol Speaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise?  Speaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows. Speaker A: That sounds wonderful! You'd get to just be out in nature all day. Sounds like a great job, especially if you're a bit introverted like me. That's why hiking is my favorite -- a good solitary activity. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n3. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking, mentioning setting up a hammock at their campsite.\n4. Speaker B enjoys camping, hiking, and is kind, caring, and hopeful for group equality.\n5. Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\n6. Speaker A plans to potentially visit the Columbia Trail and Ken Lockwood Gorge for a camping and hiking trip.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That does sound peaceful and fulfilling. Being surrounded by nature all day must be so rejuvenating. And being introverted can definitely have its perks when you enjoy solitary activities like hiking. Who knows, maybe your next job could involve leading nature hikes or guiding camping trips!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains pieces of information that are somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it mentions Speaker A's application to a grocery store which connects to the discussion about the job offer at the grocery store. Additionally, it highlights Speaker A's and B's interest in hiking and camping, aligning with the conversation about the enjoyment of being in nature. However, the MEMORY also includes details that do not directly impact the continuation of the current dialogue, like Speaker A's recent graduation and cross-country journey, which may not be particularly relevant or necessary for generating a next response. Some sentences also feel disconnected without a clear causal narrative linking them to the context, such as Speaker B's friend's past employment at the grocery store and Speaker A's future travel plans, which are not mentioned in the conversation. Overall, while there are helpful components, the MEMORY lacks a coherent connection throughout."
