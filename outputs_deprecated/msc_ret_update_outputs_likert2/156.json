Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it! Speaker B: I'm glad you liked it. My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to? Speaker A: I recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca. It was super cute and made me want to go visit Italy, but that was too expensive, so instead I booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month. What about you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has seen the Disney movie 'Luca' recently.\n2. Speaker B's kids enjoyed watching 'Luca' and said it was good.\n3. Speaker B's kids enjoy watching Disney movies, which Speaker B also finds good.\n4. Speaker B's husband enjoys Disney sports movies, such as 'Miracle'.\n5. Speaker B recommends Speaker A to watch 'Miracle'.\n6. Speaker B enjoys watching movies with her kids.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds amazing! Italy and Hawaii both sound like dream destinations. I'm sure you'll have a fantastic time on the sunset tour. As for us, we've been rewatching some of our favorite Disney classics at home with the kids. It's always a fun movie night for the whole family.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains information that is somewhat helpful but also includes elements that may not be directly relevant or naturally connected to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Memory points 1, 3, 4, and 6 are relevant as they relate to Disney movies and family preferences towards such films, which is the topic being discussed in the context. However, Memory point 2 is slightly inaccurate because it assumes Speaker B's kids enjoyed 'Luca', even though they (along with Speaker B) have not mentioned watching it in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Memory point 5 mentions Speaker B recommending 'Miracle', which matches the context of Speaker A saying they watched it, but it is not helpful for generating a response since the conversation has moved past this recommendation. Overall, while the MEMORY contains pieces of relevant information, they do not always demonstrate clear connections or causality to the dialogue context, hence a score of 3."
