Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue. Speaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad. Speaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs! Speaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is looking to redecorate their house and likes purple furniture.\n2. Speaker B regrets their green and purple color scheme and is willing to give away their purple furniture.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing furniture and home decor choices.\n4. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n5. Speaker A has devices to keep bugs away and offers to share the product names with Speaker B.\n6. Speaker A is looking forward to spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I got my patio furniture from a local store that specializes in outdoor furniture. They had a great selection, so I'm sure you'll find something you like. And don't worry about the green and purple color scheme, we can work together to find something that suits your taste better.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY does offer some relevant information about the preferences and context around furniture and home decor choices that Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing. It highlights that Speaker B regrets their current color scheme, creating alignment with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A offers a solution. However, MEMORY points like \"Speaker A is looking to redecorate their house and likes purple furniture\" don't align well with the context and can instead confuse the situation since Speaker A doesn't mention redecorating their own house in the dialogue. Some sentences, like \"Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company,\" seem unrelated to the context, while the mention of devices to keep bugs away lines up with bringing a lamp that repels mosquitos in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Thus, while there are relevant points, the span of MEMORY is not entirely cohesive or directly helpful for advancing the specific dialogue."
