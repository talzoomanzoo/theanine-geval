Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is looking forward to spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights.\n2. Speaker B suggests making enough barbeque for leftovers on nights when grilling is not possible, due to time or energy constraints.\n3. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n4. Speaker B plans to bring a new marinade and a six pack of beer for the gathering.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy barbecuing and have a love for pets.\n6. Speaker A recommends seasoning everything and using a smoker for grilling.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY provides a rich context that is highly relevant and helpful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It outlines activities and preferences of both speakers in relation to barbecuing, which is the central theme of Speaker A's statement about playing guitar. The MEMORY includes details about previous conversations and plans, such as suggestions for making enough barbecue for leftovers, the intent to spend evenings outside grilling, an invitation to enjoy new furniture, and bringing a marinade and beer. These elements show a well-connected sequence of events, reflecting their shared interests and planned activities. This helps maintain a coherent and contextually appropriate response related to the upcoming barbecue and Speaker A's guitar playing initiative."
