Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work.\n2. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n3. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker.\n4. Speaker A has given a pressure cooker as a gift and uses it for recipes like lamb shanks.\n5. Speaker A recommends the pressure cooker for its efficiency and ease of use, suggesting it to Speaker B.\n6. Speaker B's husband is a great cook and Speaker B is not skilled in cooking.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great, thank you! I'll definitely give it a try. I think my husband will be impressed with my new cooking skills.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information that can aid in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It provides context about Speaker B's interest in learning to cook with a pressure cooker and mentions that Speaker B's husband enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work. This is directly related to Speaker A's recommendations about beginner recipes and Asian food. However, while the MEMORY is mostly helpful and provides relevant details, it could be more effective by consolidating the information (e.g., merging similar points about the husband being a great cook) to reduce redundancy and improve the natural flow of connection. Nonetheless, the existing memory offers good contextual information for understanding both speakers' interests and their cooking skill levels."
