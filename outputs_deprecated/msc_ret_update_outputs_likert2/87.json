Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids? Speaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call! Speaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand. Speaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip?  Speaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery Speaker B: Yes I think that's a great idea, how is work at the library?  Speaker A: Busy, and demanding because we are short staffed. While there seems to be little need for a library these days, I find that we have less staff to get everything done Speaker B: Well if you ever need someone to come and help for a couple of hours here and there, give me a call, you know how much I love to be in the library anyway Speaker A: I will keep that in mind as we do have volunteer hours available. How is your family doing these days? Speaker B: Well I would be happy to help. My family are all great thank you for asking I took the grandkids to the park again we had a great time. How's your family doing?  Speaker A: They are good. I wish I coudl spend more time with them but my job is keeping me busy. I do hope they take up some hobbies that involve the outdoors or something more creative.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n2. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n3. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n4. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n5. Speaker A sees parents bringing in their little kids to the library as encouraging.\n6. Speaker A is a retired librarian who enjoys implementing creative activities in their library.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "It's tough balancing work and family, but I'm sure they understand. Maybe you could introduce some creative activities at home to spark their interest in the outdoors.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains relevant information that is helpful for a language model to generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes points about both Speaker A and Speaker B which relate to their family life and interests. For instance, it notes Speaker B's enjoyment of spending time with their grandkids at the park, which builds on their current discussion of spending time with family and potential fishing trips. It also mentions Speaker A's busy work life and interest in library activities, which aligns with similar topics touched in the dialogue. Though the MEMORY could be improved by having more direct connections or causality explanations for some points (e.g., reaction to a fishing trip), it provides informative insights relevant to the dialogue."
