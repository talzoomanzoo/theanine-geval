Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok?  Speaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish? Speaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n2. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n3. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n4. Speaker B loves the beach and Mediterranean food.\n5. Speaker A is an omnivore.\n6. Speaker A's restaurant plays a mix of songs, mainly easy listening, to create a relaxing environment for diners.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds delicious! I can't wait to see the picture and hear how it tastes. Your workplace seems to have some amazing dishes on the menu.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some information that could be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT such as Speaker A working at a restaurant, which ties into the conversation about the new dish on the menu. The fact that Speaker A gets two free meals per week is also somewhat relevant since they mention they can't wait to try the dish for free. However, the MEMORY does not directly contribute additional helpful information related to the Chicken parmesan dish or the excitement Speaker A feels. The details about Speaker Bâ€™s preferences, the ambiance in the restaurant, and other general information about Speaker A's job aren't directly connected to the current conversation, thus limiting its overall helpfulness. The sentences are connected in a natural manner, but there's limited causality or direct relevance to the specific context of the dialogue."
