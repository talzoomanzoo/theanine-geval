Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin! Speaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name?  Speaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls!  Speaker B: I see what you meant. Plus the color is beautiful orange. I want to see them together, even I am not a cat person they must be cute together at that time. Once the kitten grows up, situation gonna change to me. How are they, they are doing well?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Marmalade.\n2. Speaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten.\n3. Speaker B is not a cat person but ends up taking care of stray cats brought home by kids.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B have a light-hearted and humorous conversation about their pets and travels.\n5. Speaker A usually leaves their cats with a friend while traveling.\n6. Speaker B loves dogs.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "They are getting along surprisingly well! Ginger seems to have taken on the role of a protective big sister, and Pumpkin is just a bundle of energy and mischief. It's quite entertaining to watch them interact, even for a non-cat person like you!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that helps in understanding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, the fact that Speaker A has a cat named Ginger (mentioned in MEMORY 1 and relevant to the context where spices are discussed) and is considering naming the new kitten Marmalade is directly tied to the dialogue. MEMORY 1 even mentions the consideration of the name Marmalade, which is now being changed to Pumpkin, offering a natural progression to the current context. MEMORY 3 about Speaker B's perspective on cats also aligns with the dialogue in which Speaker B expresses they are not a cat person. However, MEMORY 4 and MEMORY 6 seem somewhat disconnected or less helpful for generating an immediate next response based on this specific context, as they do not directly relate to the naming or current situation of the cats. Overall, the MEMORY generally connects well, but some parts could be more immediately relevant to increase coherence."
