Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully.\n2. Speaker A volunteers at a hospital and enjoys making origami crafts, specifically a 3D modular swan with glue.\n3. Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n4. Speaker B is interested in making origami animals and finds the idea cute.\n5. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next.\n6.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful context for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT since it reflects Speaker A's interest and skills in origami crafts. Specifically, it highlights Speaker A's enjoyment of origami (#1, #2), their self-learning (#3), and a specific accomplishment related to the activity (#2). This aligns with the context of winning a prize in an origami contest. Additionally, Speaker Bâ€™s interest in origami animals (#4) and their possession of a lotus origami (#6) provide grounds for a potential engaging follow-up response, such as discussing techniques or sharing each other's origami experiences.\n\nHowever, some sentences (#5) appear slightly redundant with #1, which mentions the lotus flower explicitly as a past endeavor, rather than a future intention. The interconnectedness of Speaker A and B's interests could also be more cohesively expressed. Despite these minor aspects, the memory effectively adds depth to the dialogue's main focus on Speaker A's achievement."
