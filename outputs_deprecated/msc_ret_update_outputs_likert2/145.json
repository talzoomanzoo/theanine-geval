Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place? Speaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping? Speaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B expresses concern about leaving a kitten alone during their family camping adventures.\n2. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n3. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n4. Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys.\n5. Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys.\n6. Speaker A is offering advice and seems to have experience with children.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "One of our favorite places to camp is by the lake up in the mountains. It's so peaceful and beautiful there. But sometimes I worry about leaving our kitten alone at home while we're away.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some information that could be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, the details about Speaker B being a parent and their child's interest in visiting the zoo could somewhat align with Speaker B's role as a parent and their discussion about their daughter's camping trip. However, there is limited direct connection or causality demonstrated between the topics of camping and the information in the MEMORY. The details about Speaker A's enjoyment of the zoo and experience with children do not directly link to the camping discussion either. Overall, while there are some tangentially relevant details, the MEMORY lacks clear and direct connections that would be highly helpful for generating a coherent and contextually appropriate next response."
