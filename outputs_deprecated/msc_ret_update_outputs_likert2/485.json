Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone?  Speaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!). Speaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol Speaker B: I am up for the challenge! I have a few tricks up my sleeve to deal with people like you. Speaker A: Oh geez that makes me sound difficult.lol  Do you have any new speeches coming up? Speaker B: Nope, I just cleared my schedule until the Alps marathon that you're training for. It's just you and me until you break that finish line. I'm going to start sending you a motivational quote every morning at 4 am when I want you to wake up. Speaker A: Wow 4 am.  Is it too late to change my mind?lol Speaker B: Yes. We have an iron-clad written agreement. Tell me how I'm doing so far. Is this the most motivated you've ever been in your entire life? Speaker A: No, but that's why I have you.  You're going to push me to do the things I can't bring myself to do.  I'll have more motivation tomorrow.  Today was a long work day.lol Speaker B: I'm going to try a new motivational technique with you. Would you be more frightened by a spider or a snake. I need to know before we meet up this weekend. Speaker A: A spider no question but if you ask me to hold one I'm definitely running away.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600.\n2. Speaker B is a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks.\n3.

Speaker B's job involves motivating people to be successful and follow their dreams.\n5. Speaker B is considering running a marathon and mentioned fishing and feeling depressed.\n6.

    "raw_prediction": "Don't worry, I won't ask you to hold a spider. I'll stick to motivating you to run instead! Just remember, facing your fears, whether it's spiders or running marathons, is all part of the journey to success.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights relevant aspects such as Speaker B's role as a motivational speaker, which ties into the ongoing discussion about motivation and training for marathons. Mentioning Speaker B's travel to schools and conferences for motivational speaking aligns with their motivational endeavors discussed in the context. The information about Speaker A training for marathons also fits with the conversation. However, there are some details that are less relevant or connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's consideration of running a marathon and the mention of fishing. These parts do not directly contribute to the development of the conversation about motivating Speaker A for the marathon. Overall, while there is useful information, the memory could be more cohesively tailored to the present dialogue."
