Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several pieces of relevant information that could be useful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It reveals that Speaker B is a parent interested in zoo visits and school field trips, which relates to Speaker B's interest in the Bronx Zoo mentioned in the context. Additionally, the MEMORY mentions Speaker B's focus on family discounts, which could be tied into the discussion about zoo passes. It also aligns with the interest of Speaker A in seeing a tiger named Joshua, mentioned in both MEMORY and context, suggesting a shared interest in zoo visits. Although MEMORY doesn't cover camping, the provided details about zoo visits are helpful. The connections between sentences are clear, showing causality and relevance to Speaker B's current interest in zoo adventures. Hence, the MEMORY is quite helpful for predicting Speaker B's responses related to zoos."
