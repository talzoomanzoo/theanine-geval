Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden. Speaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n4. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n5. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n6. Speaker B's parents still live in Sweden, and they find it expensive to travel there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for Speaker A to generate a relevant response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes details about Speaker A's and Speaker B's travel plans and considerations regarding the trip to Sweden. Specifically, it reveals that Speaker A is planning the trip with Speaker B, wants to visit their cousin in Sweden, and is concerned about saving money for the trip. It also highlights Speaker B's emotional connection to Sweden and the affinity towards the country. However, while the MEMORY contains relevant information, some parts (e.g., Speaker B's parents still living in Sweden) may not directly impact the immediate context of planning a trip, slightly reducing its score from a perfect 5. Nonetheless, the MEMORY is well-structured and provides contextually useful information to facilitate the conversation."
