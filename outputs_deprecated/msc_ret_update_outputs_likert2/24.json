Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting! Speaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow? Speaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner.\n2. Speaker B is considering giving up their night job to focus on lab work and school.\n3. Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n5. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n6. Speaker B is also a high school student preparing for college, working at a diner at night.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate your kind words! It's definitely a tough decision to balance everything. And you're right, with advancements in technology, it's getting harder to discern where our food comes from. Who knows, maybe one day we'll all be enjoying burgers from cloned cows without even realizing it!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides several pieces of information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker B's job at a diner and their intention to focus on lab work and school, which aligns with their concerns about balancing classes and their interest in participating in the cow cloning project. MEMORY point 2 provides context to Speaker B's statement about having to quit if classes are too hard. Points 3 and 5 provide background on Speaker B's academic interests, making the context of quitting for school purposes more understandable. However, some aspects, such as Speaker A's interest in Speaker B's hamburgers, aren't directly relevant to the lab conversation, preventing a perfect score. The sentences in MEMORY are logically connected and demonstrate the ongoing development of Speaker B's academic and work-life balance considerations."
