Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting! Speaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner.\n2. Speaker B is considering giving up their night job to focus on lab work and school.\n3. Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n5. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n6. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely, I would definitely try a hamburger from a cloned cow! It's fascinating to think about the advancements in science and how it can potentially revolutionize the food industry. Your work in the lab must be so intriguing, especially with your interest in molecular biology.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides useful context for understanding Speaker B's background and their involvement in the conversation. Several points directly connect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, points 2 and 3 highlight Speaker B's academic focus and the potential conflict between work and studying, which aligns with the context of possibly quitting due to the difficulty of classes. Memory point 6 also fits well as it shows Speaker B's commitment to lab work. These points contribute to understanding Speaker B's dilemma about managing work and school. However, some memory pieces, like the information about the diner hamburgers and the chili dog casserole, do not aid directly in generating a future response about lab work or cloning, but they provide a broader understanding of the interaction between the speakers. Overall, the MEMORY is predominantly cohesive and relevant to the context, thereby earning a high helpfulness score."
