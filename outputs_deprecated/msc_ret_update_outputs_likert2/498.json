Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive. Speaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B have a friendly interaction and part ways on a positive note.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n3. Speaker A used to live in a suburb of DC and misses the convenience of city life.\n4. Speaker B appreciates the convenience of city living but also values what the country has to offer.\n5. Speaker A enjoys the peace and quiet of country life, the fresh produce, and fresh air.\n6. Speaker B is open to moving to the country to be further away from neighbors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some background information about Speaker A and Speaker B's preferences and past interactions, but it does not contain information directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT regarding Speaker A's purchase of a new iPhone. Most of the memory items pertain to discussions about lifestyle preferences in terms of city versus country living, which are unrelated to the current topic of conversation about the new iPhone. The first memory item mentions a friendly interaction and a positive parting note, but it is too vague to offer specific insights into the current dialogue about the iPhone. Memories about buying lotto tickets or living situations offer little to no logical connection or causality that would assist in generating a suitable response regarding the iPhone purchase. As such, the MEMORY does not provide much helpful or directly relevant content to guide Speaker A in constructing a follow-up response."
