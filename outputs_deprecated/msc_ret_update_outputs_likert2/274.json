Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her? Speaker B: Hi there, hope you are wlll and managing to save up for your Italy trip?  Thank for asking about the Greek mythology study, we are doing very well. It helps because i am so passionate about it and hope to get to the Greek islands soon\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology.\n2. Speaker B enjoys Greek mythology and did a case study on Poseidon, the God of the Sea, Earthquakes, and Horses.\n3. Speaker A is fascinated by the architecture of Italy and enjoys studying history, especially through reading and watching documentaries.\n4. Speaker A is planning to travel to Italy alone for Spring Break and has friends from Europe meeting up with them.\n5. Speaker B has been to Italy in the past and enjoyed the food there.\n6. Speaker B's daughter is lucky to grow up close to the beach, only a fifteen-minute walk away.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear that you're doing well! It's wonderful that you're so passionate about Greek mythology. I'm sure your daughter will love hearing all about it too. And thank you, I'm trying my best to save up for the Italy trip. It's exciting to have something to look forward to!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY is quite helpful in generating a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Several sentences in the MEMORY provide relevant information:\n\n1. Sentence 1 sets the stage by confirming Speaker B's interest in Greek mythology and desire to visit Greece, which links well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where they welcome inquiry into their study of Greek mythology with their daughter. \n2. Sentence 2 further solidifies the relevance by detailing Speaker B's interest in Greek mythology through a case study on Poseidon, suggesting they have shared or could share exciting stories with their daughter.\n3. Sentence 6 is particularly relevant, as it directly relates to Speaker A's inquiry about Speaker B's daughter, noting that she is fortunate to live near the beach.\n\nThe MEMORY sentences are naturally connected and provide causal/relevant background developmentâ€”like where Speaker B's interests are rooted and how it might influence interactions with their daughter or conversations with Speaker A. Overall, MEMORY information could aid Speaker A in continuing the conversation smoothly and meaningfully. However, some parts, like sentences concerning Italy travels, are less directly connected to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT and could be considered less helpful in this specific instance."
