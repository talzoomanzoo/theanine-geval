Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company? Do you build computers or work on programming?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B works for a computer company and is unable to change careers until their child graduates.\n2. Speaker A works for a small local business with a demanding schedule.\n3. Speaker A enjoys reading books about ice cream, Disney World, and computers.\n4. Speaker A is 27 years old and hopes to change careers soon.\n5. Speaker A is considering a career in dentistry but is also interested in working at Disney for happiness.\n6. Speaker A is torn between choosing a career in dentistry for the money or working at Disney for happiness.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information, particularly regarding Speaker A's career considerations and interests, which might be helpful in generating a response related to their job or future aspirations. However, the connection between the sentences in the MEMORY is weak, and the information is not directly related to the question asked in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Speaker A's current job at the computer company. There is no information about Speaker A's role or tasks at the company, which would have been directly relevant. Additionally, the MEMORY introduces unrelated topics like Disney World and dentistry, which do not contribute to understanding the current context or guiding the next response. Overall, the MEMORY lacks focus on the current job situation discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and does not provide clear causal or relevant connections to facilitate generating an appropriate next response."
