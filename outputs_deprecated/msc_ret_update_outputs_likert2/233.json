Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet?  Speaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name? Speaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended.  Speaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along! Speaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n2. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n3. Speaker A is interested in training tips for the kittens and is open to adopting one despite having a parrot.\n4. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n5. Speaker A's parrot Tasha has seen cats before and ignores them.\n6. Speaker A suggested the name Zhao for one of the kittens.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's a good point! It sounds like Tasha might enjoy having some new furry friends around. And who knows, maybe they'll all get along better than you think!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains useful information, such as Speaker A having a parrot named Tasha, being interested in adopting rescue kittens, and considering the dynamics between the parrot and the new kittens. Some sentences indicate Speaker B's involvement in adopting kittens and contemplating Mandarin names based on personality, which contrasts with what is mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about considering the name Oreo. However, MEMORY displays a mix of relevant information and unrelated or contradictory parts not coherent with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, limiting its overall helpfulness. Some sentences suggest additional context like names mentioned (e.g., Zhao) that could help in generating responses, but are not referenced or connected directly in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT setting."
