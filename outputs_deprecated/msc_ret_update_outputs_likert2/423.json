Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel.\n2. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans.\n3. Speaker B prefers animals to humans but acknowledges the importance of curing diseases.\n4. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n5. Speaker B goes to Hawaii for scuba diving and is considering studying marine life or a different type of animal.\n6. Speaker A is scared of sharks but finds the idea of going into a steel cage with them interesting.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful background information about Speaker B's preferences and activities, which might help inform responses about their pet snakes. For example, knowing that Speaker B has an interest in animals and studies them can lead to a conversation about snake care or related topics. However, the connections between the sentences are somewhat loose and do not strongly indicate causality or relevance to the current dialogue context. For instance, the information about scuba diving and plans to study marine life feels less directly relevant to the immediate topic of pet snakes, though it paints a general picture of Speaker B's interests. Thus, while MEMORY contains some relevant knowledge, it lacks stronger connections specific to the context."
