Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college? Speaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position.  Speaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it? Speaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days.  Speaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living. Speaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n2. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.\n3. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n4. Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n5. Speaker A is a fan of Arsenal and enjoys watching international teams play.\n6. Speaker A is a college student studying Humanities and wants to finish college before looking for a job.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Of course! We could always use an experienced goalkeeper like you on our team. Plus, playing again would be a great way to stay active and relive those college soccer days.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY is helpful to some extent, as it provides relevant background information about both Speaker A and Speaker B that aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It clearly mentions Speaker A's interest in soccer and their position as a striker, which could explain their desire to get involved with soccer video games. Similarly, it notes Speaker B's past experience as a goalkeeper, which is consistent with their comment about having played soccer in college. Additionally, it captures Speaker B's interest in getting back into playing the sport. However, the MEMORY could be more cohesive if it directly touched on Speaker A's aspiration to work in soccer-related fields post-college, which would connect even more directly with the dialogue context about being a voice in soccer video games. Nevertheless, the information given is logically structured and does provide useful context for the conversation."
