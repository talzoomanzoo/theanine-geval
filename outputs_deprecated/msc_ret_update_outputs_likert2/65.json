    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like. Speaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk? Speaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous. Speaker B: That sounds amazing! Did you bring a pet? I love doing the harder trails with my dog. Sometimes, it's very peaceful to get away from everything. Speaker A: No, I don't have any pets; my apartment seems too small for a dog and I would worry about them being lonely all day when I'm at work. I was thinking about getting a pair of cats, but I haven't committed yet. How nice fo ryou to have company when you're walking though! What kind of dog do you have? Speaker B: Cats can be nice! I used to have cats, but am allergic to them and had to give them to my friend. I have an Australian Kelpie who is a rescue. She is very energetic and smart! Speaker A: I had cats as a child and I think that they're a bit easier to care for than dogs, especially in the city. I am a dog lover as well though; Australian Kelpies are gorgeous! What is her name? Does she walk well off-leash? Speaker B: Yes, cats are very smart and clean. Mine used to bring me a mouse to throw for her, just like a dog! And if you have 2 cats, they play with each other! Mine would run up and down the halls in the middle of the night, haha. Her name is Kyrie, and she walks off leash and is very obedient. Dogs might be hard to keep in your small apartment though, since Kyrie likes to play in the field, run with cars along the fence row, and herd goats.  Speaker A: Oh wow! So Kyrie is a working dog? She helps your dad out on the farm? Speaker B: She herds them for fun, haha. Goats mostly graze wherever they like in the fields, but she likes to group them up and walk them into a pen. My grandpa says it's from her cattle herding heritage. Speaker A: I like the idea of having so much space out in the country, but I think at heart I'm still a city girl. There is a part of me that likes being surrounded by people and I love to people watch on my walks through the city just as much as I love to nature watch on my walks through the country.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B lives in the country, loves nature, and works with animals.\n2. Speaker A is a city dweller who walks to work instead of driving.\n3. Speaker A also enjoyed reading 'Redwall' growing up and keeps an eye out for similar books.\n4. Speaker B enjoys reading the Odd Thomas and Dark Tower series and finds inspiration for their artwork during nature walks.\n5. Speaker A is a fan of the Game of Thrones series and enjoys audiobooks.\n6. Speaker B's family consists of a nurse mom, a farmer dad, and a sister.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "It's fascinating how different environments can appeal to different people! I find the hustle and bustle of the city intriguing, but nothing beats the tranquility and beauty of nature for me. It's wonderful that we can appreciate both in our own unique ways.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information that could be helpful for generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, it mentions that Speaker B lives in the country and works with animals, which aligns with Speaker B's role as a dog owner and someone who lets their dog herd goats for fun. This establishes a connection with the conversation about being an animal lover and mentioning fields and farms. However, other details, such as reading preferences and Speaker A's commute habits, are not directly relevant to the immediate conversation about nature walks, pets, or lifestyle differences between the city and the country. Therefore, while some parts of the MEMORY are relevant, others do not contribute effectively to the context and natural development of the discussion at hand."
