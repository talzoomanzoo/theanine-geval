Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play?  Speaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music. Speaker A: ah right, who's your favourite rock band? Speaker B: I'm big fan of aerosmith. When do you learn music. Whom teach you?

    "raw_prediction": "I learned how to surf when I was just a kid, growing up on the beach. My dad taught me how to catch those waves. It's all about balance and feeling the rhythm of the ocean. It's a lot like playing music, actually.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT insofar as it relates to music and learning skills, such as surfing and fishing lessons, which can parallel learning musical instruments. However, the information regarding surfing and fishing does not directly connect to the current context involving musical instruments, specifically the drums and piano. While it provides some insight into Speaker A's and Speaker B's interests and skills, the MEMORY lacks direct relevance and causality to the ongoing dialogue about learning music and playing instruments. The memory points are disjointed and not naturally connected to the progression of the conversation at hand, limiting its helpfulness in generating a meaningful next response."
