Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on! Speaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar. Speaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general? Speaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts. Speaker A: How's learning to bake going in general, especially now that you're off desserts? Speaker B: I one of those people how have to fail a couple of times before I get the hang of it, but I'm getting there.  Have you and the kids had any chance to go skiing lately?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes.\n2. Speaker B does not do a lot of cooking or baking but is interested in learning.\n3. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n4. Speaker B is excited to join Speaker A's family for a water skiing trip and wants to learn from Speaker A's kids.\n5. Speaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners.\n6. Speaker A is eating their favorite jello.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "We haven't been skiing recently, but we're planning a trip soon. I'm sure the kids would love to have you join us and maybe even teach you a thing or two about skiing. And who knows, maybe we can incorporate some jello-making into our trip as well!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it highlights that Speaker B is interested in learning to cook or bake, which connects with the context about Speaker B's journey in learning to bake and watching how-to videos. However, the memory about Speaker A's grandmother, favorite jello flavors (cherry), or eating jello currently does not effectively align with the ongoing baking discussion nor does it naturally connect to the topics of dieting or skiing mentioned in the dialogue. Additionally, there is no mention of skiing in the memory, making Speaker B's inquiry about skiing appear disconnected from the provided memory. Overall, the MEMORY lacks cohesiveness and relevance to the specific flow of the dialogue."
