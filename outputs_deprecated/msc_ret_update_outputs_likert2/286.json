Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice.  Speaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with? Speaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work.\n2. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker.\n3. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n4. Speaker A recommends the pressure cooker for its efficiency and ease of use, suggesting it to Speaker B.\n5. Speaker A has given a pressure cooker as a gift and uses it for recipes like lamb shanks.\n6. Speaker B's husband is a great cook and Speaker B is not skilled in cooking.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great idea! I'll give it a try. I'm excited to learn some new recipes using the pressure cooker.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful information that connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and aids in generating a response. It highlights Speaker B's interest in learning to cook and her husband's proficiency in cooking, specifically in making Asian dishes. This is directly relevant to the current conversation where Speaker B is seeking beginner recipes. Additionally, it notes Speaker A's expertise and experience with pressure cookers, aligning with the context where pressure cooking is suggested. However, some information like the specific recipes Speaker A enjoys (dahl, pilaf rice, tandoori chicken) and that she has given pressure cookers as gifts, while interesting, is not directly relevant to the current dialogue about beginner recipes. Overall, the MEMORY contains helpful context but could be more focused on the immediate conversational topic."
