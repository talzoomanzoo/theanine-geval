Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast. Speaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project. Speaker A: Quite a few, but it wasn't too crowded. It was a nice change of scenery. What kind of project are you working on? Speaker B: I'm sure the student appreciate that. You teach as a group as apposed to one-on-one right? And one of the companies I work for had their system hit with a virus so I've been upgraded their software to debug the system. Speaker A: I teach group classes and one on one, but I was the student today. I specialize in jiu-jitsu but today I got to be the student in a taekwondo class.  Speaker B: That's even better, learning is a life-long journey. How are you class on martial art history? When you have time teach me too, I'd love to learn.  Speaker A: It's been a little stressful lately, because finals are coming up...but I'm confident in that class. I could've aced it before I even started! I'll definitely get started with you after finals. Speaker B: Ahaha we;; for someone who's so passionate about martial arts I'm not surprised. Great, I'll try to be the best student I can. I'm starving, think I should grab some take-out from Sufi?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class and enjoys it.\n2. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts.\n3. Speaker A is a martial arts teacher and student and is pursuing an athletic training degree in college.\n4. Both Speaker A and Speaker B are interested in martial arts and enjoy learning new things.\n5. Speaker A is a college student who teaches jiu-jitsu and is lactose intolerant.\n6.

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate your enthusiasm for learning martial arts history! Sufi sounds like a great choice for take-out, but have you considered trying the new Taco Bell in town?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that can aid in generating a proper response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights Speaker A's involvement in martial arts and teaching, which aligns with the current dialogue about attending and teaching martial arts classes. It also indicates Speaker B's interest in martial arts, which is relevant since they expressed a desire to learn from Speaker A. However, the MEMORY introduces new details (e.g., Speaker A being lactose intolerant, having a Taco Bell preference) that are unrelated to the immediate conversation about martial arts, although they could be useful for future responses. Overall, the MEMORY connects well with the dialogue and has some tangential points that could enhance future conversations."
