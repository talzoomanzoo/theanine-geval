Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam? Speaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A. Speaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n2. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n3. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n4. Speaker A advises Speaker B to take breaks and prioritize their own happiness and well-being.\n5. Both speakers value good grades and believe it can lead to better job opportunities.\n6. Speaker B feels overwhelmed by their mother's strictness and is eager to finish school to escape it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for Speaker A, representing a well-rounded background to generate a next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY contains sentences that demonstrate causality and relevancy. For instance, it notes Speaker B's focus on sports medicine and the pressure they feel to maintain good grades due to their family's expectations (sentences 1, 3, and 6). These details provide context for Speaker B's current exam situation or stress levels, which is relevant to their dialogue about upcoming exams. Additionally, Speaker A's struggle with grades and their confidence in gym class (sentence 2) adds to understanding Speaker A's mindset in the conversation about exams. Moreover, Speaker A's advice on taking breaks (sentence 4) could guide generating a supportive response to Speaker B's exams and pressures. However, some elements could be strengthened, such as a more direct connection between the MEMORY details and the exams currently under discussion, which would merit a perfect score."
