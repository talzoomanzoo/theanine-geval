Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin! Speaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name?  Speaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls!  Speaker B: I see what you meant. Plus the color is beautiful orange. I want to see them together, even I am not a cat person they must be cute together at that time. Once the kitten grows up, situation gonna change to me. How are they, they are doing well? Speaker A: Marmalade is orange too but this is better because the baby is sassy and climbs up my leg to sit on my shoulder. I don't understand how you are not a cat person when you have such a large heart for stray kittens. Speaker B: hehe you're right. But i can't explain that why I am not a cat person to you sorry. How's the weather like today, still good weather to have iced tea out there?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Marmalade.\n2. Speaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten.\n3. Speaker B is not a cat person but ends up taking care of stray cats brought home by kids.\n4. Speaker A is from a city known for great iced teas and prefers unsweetened iced tea.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B have a light-hearted and humorous conversation about their pets and travels.\n6. Speaker A enjoys drinking tea and water.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "The weather is perfect for some unsweetened iced tea today! It's so refreshing. And don't worry about not being a cat person, everyone has their preferences. Maybe one day Pumpkin will win you over with those cute orange furballs!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful background information about Speaker A and Speaker B's preferences and past interactions, which could aid in generating a more nuanced response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Key elements from the MEMORY include Speaker A's cat named Ginger and the consideration of naming the new kitten Marmalade (point 1), which is relevant to the context about naming the new kitten Pumpkin. It also highlights Speaker B's non-preference for cats despite taking care of stray kittens (point 3), aligning with their statement about not being a cat person. Additionally, information about Speaker A being from a city known for great iced teas and preferring unsweetened iced tea (point 4) relates well to the current line about the weather being good for iced tea. These interconnected pieces help provide a fuller background context, even though not all points are directly mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the Subaru (point 1) and general conversations about travels (point 5). The information is mostly structured in a naturally connected way, supporting relevance and causality."
