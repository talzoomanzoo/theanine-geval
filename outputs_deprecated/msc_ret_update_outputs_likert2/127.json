Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well? Speaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes? Speaker A: I want to take some martial art classes at school next year. What do you sggest I try?

I will meet you at the Dojo at 3pm. I really appriciate it, and I will buy you lunch after too. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B signed up for classes at the local college and has a background in football and karate.\n2.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be helpful in generating the next response for Speaker B in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, the background in karate (as noted in sentence 1 and 2) is directly relevant and supports Speaker B's enthusiasm for recommending karate class to Speaker A. Additionally, Speaker B's schedule as potentially someone going back to school (from sentence 2) could offer context for availability and suggestions beyond the current invitation. \n\nHowever, many parts of the MEMORY, such as football games, language interests, or water-related activities, don't directly relate to the dialogue's primary focus on martial arts. Consequently, while these elements offer a glimpse of Speaker B's personality, they may not significantly aid in generating a more relevant response based on the immediate context of arranging the dojo meet-up. Thus, the MEMORY is partially relevant but could be more tightly connected to the immediate conversational context.\n\n"
