Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on! Speaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar. Speaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general? Speaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts. Speaker A: How's learning to bake going in general, especially now that you're off desserts?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes.\n2. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n3. Speaker B does not do a lot of cooking or baking but is interested in learning.\n4. Speaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners.\n5. Speaker A is eating their favorite jello.\n6. Speaker B also enjoys jello, with cherry being their favorite flavor as well.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Learning to bake has been a fun challenge, especially trying to find healthier alternatives to satisfy my sweet tooth. It's been eye-opening to see just how much sugar goes into traditional desserts, but I'm excited to experiment with new recipes and techniques.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains several pieces of information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, both speakers have a shared interest in jello recipes, with Speaker A having a grandmother who influences this interest and Speaker B enjoying jello, particularly the cherry flavor. The memory captures Speaker B's interest in learning cooking/baking, which aligns with the current dialogue context about learning and sharing family recipes. However, the information about Speaker A's grandmother and favorite jello flavor is less relevant to the immediate conversation, which focuses more on Speaker B's experiences and intentions regarding dessert-making and dietary concerns. Additionally, while the memory points out that Speaker B enjoys jello, it doesn't explicitly link this enjoyment to their new baking habits discussed in the context. Overall, while the memory includes connected information, its relevance to generating the next response is moderately helpful."
