Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it! Speaker B: I'm glad you liked it. My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to? Speaker A: I recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca. It was super cute and made me want to go visit Italy, but that was too expensive, so instead I booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month. What about you? Speaker B: I have been relaxing with the kids as much as I have. My husband has been busy with work, so we haven't had time for anything big. I would love to visit Italy some day though if we get the chance. Have you ever been to Italy before? Speaker A: I have never gone to Italy because I'm always so busy. If I ever go, I would want to spend a month there, but work has been hectic lately. Would your kids go with you if you went to Italy? Speaker B: Absolutely! I'd love to travel all over the world with my family to see everything. Hawaii sounds like just as much fun though. What are you most excited about doing when you get there? Speaker A: I'm extremely excited about the sunset tour. Each day is at a new location to watch the sunset. It's suppose to be romantic, but I am just going alone, so I see it as more calming than anything. Speaker B: I hope you have a lot fun. It sounds like a nice time to get away from everything. You should eat as much of the local Hawaiian food as you can. Have you had Hawaiian food before? I think it's great. Speaker A: No, I acctually haven't. I'm expecting pineapple and ham on everything, but I know they will having some amazing cultural food that is probably going to blow my mind! Is there a specific dish you would recommend Speaker B: I enjoy foods like Spam musubi, loco mocos, and poi. My favorite might be kalua pork. The way they prepare the pig makes it taste so good.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has seen the Disney movie 'Luca' recently.\n2.

    "raw_prediction": "Kalua pork sounds delicious! I'll definitely make sure to try it when I'm in Hawaii. I can't wait to experience the local cuisine and soak in the beautiful sunsets. It's going to be an unforgettable trip.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information, but it's a mixed collection in terms of helpfulness. Points like Speaker A having recently seen \"Luca\" (1) and booking a Hawaii Sunset tour (2) are relevant and connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as they reflect Speaker A's actions and interests discussed. However, other parts of the MEMORY, like point 3, about Speaker B's kids enjoying \"Luca,\" do not appear in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and could be considered irrelevant for forming a response. The mention of Speaker A working two jobs and struggling yet managing to plan a trip (4) offers relevant insight into Speaker A's life, although it isn't directly addressed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Points 5 and 6 both repeat the information that Speaker B and her kids enjoy Disney movies, with one of those points already noted in the conversation. Overall, while some sentences in MEMORY are helpful in providing context and insights that could guide the conversation, others either repeat information without extension or are disconnected from the direct dialogue and thus, provide varying levels of helpfulness."
