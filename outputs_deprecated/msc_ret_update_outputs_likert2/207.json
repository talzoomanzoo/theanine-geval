Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is looking for internships in the sports medicine field and has asked professors for letters of recommendation.\n2. Speaker A is offering advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field.\n3. Speaker B's professors have been supportive in writing letters for an internship application.\n4. Speaker B is studying sports medicine and plays soccer, looking to join their college team in the future.\n5. Speaker B is struggling with finding internships and feels like they are at a disadvantage compared to others with connections.\n6. Speaker A is interested in getting tips from locals and knows someone named John who could help.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's amazing, thank you so much for connecting me with them! I'll be sure to reach out and see if there are any opportunities that align with my goals in sports medicine. Having connections like these can really make a difference in finding the right internship.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes Speaker B's interest and pursuit in the sports medicine field, which aligns with the opportunity mentioned by Speaker A about the athletic trainer's interest in discussing internships. Additionally, the MEMORY highlights several key aspects of Speaker B's context: their struggle in finding internships, the support from professors, and their academic and athletic background. These aspects are relevant as they provide a comprehensive understanding of Speaker B's situation, as well as the importance of networking opportunities. However, the presence of Speaker A seeking tips from locals and knowing someone named John seems somewhat tangential and less directly connected to the context of an internship. The MEMORY could be improved if it offered clearer links between each piece of information. Despite this, it remains fairly coherent and helpful."
