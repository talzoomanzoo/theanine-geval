Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600.\n2. Speaker A is training for marathons and seeking advice on how to recover.\n3. Speaker B is a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks.\n4. Speaker B got into motivational speaking because they needed it themselves to battle depression and anxiety.\n5. Speaker B's job involves motivating people to be successful and follow their dreams.\n6. Speaker B is considering running a marathon and mentioned fishing and feeling depressed.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "The speech went well, thank you! I'm glad to hear you're looking for motivation. I actually know a few great motivational speakers who could help. I can connect you with someone who specializes in fitness motivation. Just remember, the first step is always the hardest, but once you get started, you'll build momentum and achieve your goals.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for generating a proper response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights several key points:\n\n1. Speaker B is a motivational speaker, which directly relates to Speaker A's request for a motivational speaker to help with motivation to run (Memory 3, 5).\n2. Speaker B's background in motivational speaking, along with their personal experience with overcoming depression and anxiety, suggests they might be inspirational and effective in motivating others (Memories 4, 5).\n3. Speaker A's interest in running and marathons, along with their request for motivation, ties back to their previous invitation to Speaker B to run together and meet for training (Memory 1).\n\nAdditionally, these MEMORY entries are naturally connected, demonstrating the relevancy, connection, and potential causality needed to inform Speaker B's response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT effectively."
