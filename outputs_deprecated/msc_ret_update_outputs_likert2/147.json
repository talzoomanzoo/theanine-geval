    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place? Speaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping? Speaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp? Speaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer? Speaker A: I've only camped in a tent so far, but would like to try out a camper trailer. What do use for camping?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B expresses concern about leaving a kitten alone during their family camping adventures.\n2. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n3. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n4. Speaker B just moved to America and is unfamiliar with the places.\n5. Speaker A is offering advice and seems to have experience with children.\n6. Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "We usually go for a camper trailer. It's more convenient with kids, especially when we bring our kitten along. It's nice to have a cozy space for everyone.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided does contain information that is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, the fact that Speaker B is a parent suggests some context about their family trips and interests that could connect to camping activities, as discussed. However, the memory lacks clear and natural connections or causality to help generate the next response effectively. Many points in MEMORY are tangential or unrelated to the ongoing conversation about camping, such as field trips to the zoo and experiences visiting the zoo frequently. The relevance and flow of the MEMORY are limited, leading to a low score."
