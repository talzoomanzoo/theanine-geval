Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on! Speaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar. Speaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general? Speaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts. Speaker A: How's learning to bake going in general, especially now that you're off desserts? Speaker B: I one of those people how have to fail a couple of times before I get the hang of it, but I'm getting there.  Have you and the kids had any chance to go skiing lately? Speaker A: Water skiing? Yes, last weekend. It was so much fun!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is excited to join Speaker A's family for a water skiing trip and wants to learn from Speaker A's kids.\n2. Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes.\n3. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n4. Speaker B does not do a lot of cooking or baking but is interested in learning.\n5. Speaker A has been water skiing for 15 years and has 3 kids who also water ski.\n6. Speaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a blast! I can't wait to join you all on the water skiing trip. I'm sure your kids are amazing at it, and I'm excited to learn from them.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that can aid in generating a response for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it highlights Speaker B's interest in cooking and baking (point 4), which is related to the context of learning to bake and passing on jello recipes. It also mentions Speaker A's connection to jello recipes through their grandmother (point 2), which ties back to the conversation about family traditions.\n\nHowever, numerous parts of the MEMORY are less directly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's excitement about water skiing (point 1) and Speaker A's history with water skiing (point 5). These details, while potentially relevant to past conversations, do not directly support forming a natural and coherent response to the current dialogue about baking and jello recipes.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides some helpful context but lacks a strong connection to the current dialogue, preventing a higher score."
