Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting! Speaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow? Speaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from. Speaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same. Speaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner.\n2. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n4. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n5. Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\n6. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's totally understandable. It's always good to be cautious and informed about what we're consuming. Plant-based options are a great alternative, and it's always fun to try new things. Maybe one day you can try my chili dog casserole too, it's a unique dish that might surprise you!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that could be connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's interest in lab work and molecular biology, which aligns with the context of working in the lab and cloning a cow. Additionally, the fact that Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab is also relevant and provides more background on their interests and activities. However, not all the sentences in MEMORY are directly relevant or provide helpful information to generate a subsequent response. For example, details about Speaker A trying hamburgers made by Speaker B or Speaker B's culinary inventions, like a chili dog casserole, have no apparent connection to the context of plant-based burgers or cloning. Furthermore, the MEMORY does not demonstrate clear causality or progression of their past interactions that would be beneficial in forming a coherent response related to the context.\n\nDespite the presence of some relevant information, the lack of clear cohesiveness and several irrelevant parts limit its helpfulness, resulting in a mid-range score."
