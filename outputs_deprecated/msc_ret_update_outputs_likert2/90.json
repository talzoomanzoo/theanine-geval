Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly!

Do you know where you want to get your new cat from? Speaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals, discovered love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets.\n2. Speaker B is a painter and is working on a portrait for Speaker A.\n3. Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions.\n4.

    "raw_prediction": "That's wonderful! Adopting from a shelter is such a kind choice. I can already imagine your new cat having some playful interactions with your dogs in the family portrait I'll paint for you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The provided MEMORY gives relevant insights about Speaker B being a painter and their interest in painting various subjects, which connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about portraits. It notes that Speaker B discovered a love for portraits through self-portraits with pets, aligning with the discussion of painting Speaker B's pets. It informs us that Speaker B likes Persian cats and has multiple dogs, which complements Speaker A's discussion about acquiring a new cat and having a preference for adopting from shelters. The MEMORY also effectively links Speaker B's painting work being related to Speaker A by mentioning a potential commission for a family portrait. Overall, the MEMORY contains useful, relevant information and maintains a natural flow connecting past interactions to the current context, although further specificity in certain details or additional context could enhance its effectiveness."
