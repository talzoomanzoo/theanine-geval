Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like. Speaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B lives in the country, loves nature, and works with animals.\n2. Speaker A is a city dweller who walks to work instead of driving.\n3. Speaker A asks about Speaker B's new artwork and acknowledges their need for inspiration.\n4. Speaker B enjoys reading the Odd Thomas and Dark Tower series and finds inspiration for their artwork during nature walks.\n5. Speaker A recommends the new album by Highly Suspect to Speaker B.\n6. Speaker A is a fan of the Game of Thrones series and enjoys audiobooks.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker B's love for nature, country living, and working with animals (1), which might be useful in continuing a conversation about nature walks. Additionally, Speaker B's enjoyment of nature walks for artistic inspiration (4) connects to the dialogue context, where the focus is on a nature walk. These points suggest a shared interest in nature that could enhance the dialogue. However, there are elements in the MEMORY that are less relevant to the current dialogue context, such as Speaker A's music recommendation (5) and Speaker A's preference for Game of Thrones and audiobooks (6). While they provide background on the speakers, they do not directly contribute to constructing a follow-up response to the given dialogue context about the nature walk. The information is somewhat disjointed with limited causality or development of interactions between the speakers, which lowers the score."
