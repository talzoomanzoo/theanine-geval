Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun! Speaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n2. Speaker B is looking forward to eating a pizza burger in a pool with punk music playing.\n3. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n4. Speaker A finds swimming relaxing and uses it to destress from their job.\n5. Speaker A knows how to swim since the age of 5.\n6. Speaker B enjoys cruising in their car while listening to punk music.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some context that is helpful for generating a next response. For example, point 1 aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as it indicates Speaker B's interest in punk music during swimming and programming activities. Item 3 can inform Speaker A's willingness to help Speaker B learn swimming, which is relevant given Speaker B's comment in the context. However, other items such as 2 and 6, about eating a pizza burger or cruising in a car, do not connect strongly to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and are less relevant. Moreover, while the memory items are informative, they do not all build a coherent, naturally connected narrative directly related to the context at hand. Therefore, the MEMORY receives a moderate score of 3."
