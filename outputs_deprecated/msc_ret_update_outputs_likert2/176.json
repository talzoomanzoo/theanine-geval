Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n4. Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy.\n5. Speaker A frequents live band venues and plays music at home.\n6. Speaker B is not going out drinking much due to their wife's pregnancy.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's really thoughtful of you to offer the cabin! I'll talk to my wife and see if that could work for us. It would definitely make things more comfortable for her during the festival. Thank you for the suggestion.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information for generating a proper response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context revolves around attending a Bluegrass show, and the MEMORY contains pertinent details such as both speakers' enjoyment of bluegrass music (Sentence 2) and the logistical considerations due to Speaker B's wife's pregnancy (Sentences 1, 3, and 6). Additionally, Speaker B's feelings about missing out on live music (Sentence 4) could influence their willingness to find alternative ways, like the cabin offer, to partake in music-related activities. Although the connection and causality between events could be a little more explicitly linked, the MEMORY includes useful insights into their discussion and is generally well-connected, which makes it suitably helpful for generating a relevant next response."
