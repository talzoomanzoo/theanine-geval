Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job! Speaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. Speaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n2. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n3. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n4. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n5. Speaker B is a professional in a practice, where it is illegal for them to have relationships with clients.\n6. Speaker A is married and has been for four years.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that Speaker B is a therapist, which is directly relevant to the current conversation about Speaker B's career choice and motivations for becoming a therapist. Additionally, knowing that Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years adds context to their experience level, which might inform Speaker A's understanding of Speaker B's perspective.\n\nHowever, the connection and relevance of other aspects in the MEMORY (like Speaker B being a football fan, Speaker A's knowledge about horses, and Speaker B's professional restrictions) are not well integrated into the ongoing dialogue. These details are not directly related to the current conversation, and their presence does not naturally contribute to the development of the dialogue.\n\nOverall, while the MEMORY includes some relevant details, it lacks a natural flow or causality that connects all the elements cohesively to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
