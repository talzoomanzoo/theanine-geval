Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\n3. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n4. Speaker A will use the money earned from the store to buy the hammock online.\n5. Speaker A plans to bring sandwiches and fruit for the hike, specifically asking about veggie sandwiches for Speaker B.\n6. Speaker B's neighbor, John, is getting divorced and selling top-of-the-line camping gear.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is clear that Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store, which is mentioned in both the context and the memory. The MEMORY contains information about Speaker A receiving a job offer from the grocery store, which naturally follows from the fact that A applied for the job. It also adds context by mentioning that A is a recent high school graduate on a journey looking for jobs, making the job offer significant. Furthermore, the MEMORY includes related plans such as using the money to buy a hammock and bringing sandwiches for a hike, adding depth to A's character and plans. Although the memory about Speaker B's neighbor might not be directly relevant, most sentences are connected and help build a narrative useful for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
