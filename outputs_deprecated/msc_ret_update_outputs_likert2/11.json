Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n2. Speaker B is looking forward to eating a pizza burger in a pool with punk music playing.\n3. Speaker B enjoys cruising in their car while listening to punk music.\n4. Speaker A finds swimming relaxing and uses it to destress from their job.\n5. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n6. Speaker A enjoys cruising and has a favorite club in school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information that can help generate a proper response from Speaker B in the context provided. Points 1 and 2 are particularly helpful as they directly relate to the activities planned for the meetup, like listening to punk music and enjoying pool activities. However, the connection between different points is somewhat weak, making the overall relevance to the context less impactful. The mentions of cruising (Points 3 and 6) and Speaker A's relaxation techniques (Point 4) are not directly tied to the main activities or plans for the weekend, which reduces the helpfulness of the MEMORY."
