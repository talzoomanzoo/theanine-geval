Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately? Speaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n2. Speaker A leads hikes for the group they camp with, which are usually an hour or two long.\n3. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n4. Speaker A is nervous about the Appalachian Trail hike, as they don't usually do full day hikes.\n5. Speaker B shared tips on repelling mosquitos using sprays with 20% DEET and other active ingredients.\n6. Speaker A enjoys hiking, birdwatching, and spotting rare animals.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "It's great that you're getting out there and leading hikes for your friends, even if they tire out quickly. Maybe you can gradually build up their stamina and get them excited about longer hikes!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides largely helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Several pieces of memory are directly relevant to the conversation. For example, MEMORY point 5 connects directly to the first line of the dialogue where Speaker A mentions loading up on repellent, indicating a past shared conversation about mosquito repellent. This establishes continuity and relevance between previous interactions and the current conversation.\n\nMEMORY points 2 and 3 provide additional context about Speaker Aâ€™s hiking habits and future plans, which can be relevant to the ongoing conversation about hiking experiences. Additionally, MEMORY point 1 gives some insight into Speaker B's own recent experiences, potentially opening up avenues for further discussion or shared stories.\n\nThe sentences in the MEMORY are mostly naturally connected and provide a reasonably clear picture of previous interactions, especially in the context of outdoor activities and hiking, which is central to the current dialogue. This helps in planning the language model's response by understanding the shared interest in hiking and camping of both speakers. The only slight disconnect could be MEMORY point 6 about birdwatching and spotting rare animals, which is not immediately linked to the current dialogue context but still relevant to the general theme of outdoor activities."
