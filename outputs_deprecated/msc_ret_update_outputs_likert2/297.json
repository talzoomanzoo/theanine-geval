Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods. Speaker B: Oh that sounds fun! What is it about? Speaker A: Black Widow is one of the character in the Marvel Avengers movies. Like Thor and Captain America.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided lacks relevance and clear connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While some aspects of the memory such as Speaker Aâ€™s enjoyment of Brazilian food and Speaker B's interest could be tangentially related to parts of the conversation, they don't directly aid in formulating a next response about the Black Widow movie or the Marvel Avengers movies. The information about salsa dancing, bartending, and healing methods doesn't provide causality or relevance to the immediate topic of movies being discussed. The MEMORY doesn't effectively support natural progress in the dialogue given the context focused on the movie and Marvel characters."
