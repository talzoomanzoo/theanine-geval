Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice.  Speaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with? Speaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think? Speaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point. Speaker A: Yes, it contains eggs.  I think you would do well with the fried rice. It's best to cook the rice the day before.   Speaker B: I didn't know that. Why cook the rice beforehand? Is it better to age rice or something? Speaker A: The rice needs to be cool before adding to the pan.  Are you able to take a passenger along in you truck? Speaker B: Oh! That makes since. I didn't realize that the temperature made a difference when frying rice. As for the truck, Yes I can. But, depending on what company I'm working for at the time, they often set restrictions on passengers.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker.\n2. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n3. Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work.\n4. Speaker A recommends the pressure cooker for its efficiency and ease of use, suggesting it to Speaker B.\n5. Speaker A has given a pressure cooker as a gift and uses it for recipes like lamb shanks.\n6. Speaker B lives in a rural area with a farm and can relate to cooking.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "No worries about the restrictions; you can always plan ahead for when you can have a passenger. It's great that you can bring along fresh eggs from your farm for the recipe. The freshness will definitely add a delicious touch to the dish.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for Speaker A to generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It informs us that Speaker B is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker, which aligns with the discussion about using a pressure cooker for rice. Moreover, it indicates that while Speaker B is not a cook, their husband is an avid cook interested in making Asian food, which justifies the suggestion of Asian recipes. There's also information about Speaker Aâ€™s experience and recommendation with pressure cookers, showing relevancy to discussions about pressure cooking and providing a shared interest. The MEMORY connects well with the current dialogue, though it could benefit from additional details on shrimp fried rice or the shared cooking experiences between the speakers for a perfect score."
