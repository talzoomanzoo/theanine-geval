Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships! Speaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!   I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is offering advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field.\n2. Speaker B is looking for internships in the sports medicine field and has asked professors for letters of recommendation.\n3. Speaker A suggests that surfing could be a way for Speaker B to make connections in the medical field.\n4. Speaker B is studying sports medicine and plays soccer, looking to join their college team in the future.\n5. Speaker B is interested in sports medicine and enjoys surfing.\n6. Speaker B's professors have been supportive in writing letters for an internship application.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm a nurse, so I have some connections in the medical field that might be helpful for you. Have you tried reaching out to any sports medicine clinics or local sports teams for internship opportunities? It could be a great way to combine your passion for sports and medicine!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains relevant information about Speaker B's interest and efforts in pursuing internships in sports medicine, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A is discussing potential internship opportunities. Sentences in MEMORY are naturally connected, providing context about Speaker B's background, such as their academic pursuits, extracurricular activities, and the support received from professors. This helps Speaker A tailor their response with more personalized advice or encouragement. However, the mention of surfing as a way to make connections is slightly less relevant to the core discussion about internships, which slightly reduces the score from perfect."
