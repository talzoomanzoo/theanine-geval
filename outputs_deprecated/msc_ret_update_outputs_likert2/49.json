Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job! Speaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. Speaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?   Speaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone. Speaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n2. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n3. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n4. Speaker B lives in the city and is interested in having a horse in the future.\n5. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B could pay a fee to a ranch to take care of a horse.\n6. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's very kind of you to offer. I appreciate it. Maybe I should give it a try, especially since you seem so passionate about helping others.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: While the MEMORY does include some relevant information, like Speaker B being a therapist and having worked in their own practice for six years (which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT's discussion about therapy), it does not establish much causality or direct link to the current context of the dialogue. The MEMORY seems to include additional details about interests and hobbies (e.g. being a football fan, wanting a horse) that are not directly connected or helpful for continuing the dialogue about becoming Speaker A's therapist or regarding the conversation about therapy and unresolved childhood trauma. Similarly, knowing that Speaker A mainly knows about horses does not directly influence the next response in a substantial way in relation to the provided context. Thus, while there are bits of helpful information, the connection to the immediate context isn't very strong or coherent overall."
