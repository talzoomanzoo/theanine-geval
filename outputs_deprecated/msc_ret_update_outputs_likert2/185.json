Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe.\n2. Speaker A likes cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally.\n3. Speaker A plays the drums and loves making food for others.\n4. Speaker A enjoys cooking and finds it helpful for stress relief.\n5. Speaker A cooked steak, fried potatoes, and shrimp for dinner with their father.\n6. Speaker B's hobbies include snowboarding, listening to music, singing, spending time with family, and cooking.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I can definitely make the garlic chicken for you! Besides that, I've taught myself how to make spicy Thai curry, jalapeno poppers, and buffalo chicken wings. I love experimenting with different levels of heat in my dishes. What about you, any favorite spicy recipes you enjoy making?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains a few pieces of information that could be relevant for generating a proper next response by Speaker B. In particular, Memory 1 indicates that Speaker B enjoys cooking and values a particular garlic chicken recipe from their grandmother, which directly relates to the question asked by Speaker A about making garlic chicken. Additionally, Memory 6 provides a general context about Speaker B's interest in cooking, which could be integrated into the response to enrich the conversation.\n\nHowever, not all elements of MEMORY are necessary for generating an appropriate response to the given dialogue. The references to Speaker A's other interests and cooking history do not directly connect to the current discussion about garlic chicken and spicy foods. The memories lack a cohesive narrative that binds them explicitly to the dialogue, making them less helpful overall. Therefore, a score of 3 is justified, as MEMORY provides some useful insights but does not fully demonstrate a clear causality or development relevant to the current dialogue context."
