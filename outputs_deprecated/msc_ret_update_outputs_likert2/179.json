Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know.  Speaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like. Speaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too. Speaker B: Nice! Is anyone coming with you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n4. Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy.\n5. Speaker A is a guitar player and values jam time over social time.\n6. Speaker A frequents live band venues and plays music at home.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4  \n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that helps in understanding the context of the conversation, specifically about the Bluegrass show and Speaker B's wife's pregnancy. Knowing that Speaker B's wife is pregnant provides context for why they might prefer staying in a cabin instead of traditional camping, as it's a more comfortable option for a pregnant woman. It also explains why they might only be considering attending the festival for one day. \n\nFurthermore, the fact that both Speaker A and B enjoy bluegrass music and are discussing festival logistics with a small baby is helpful to understand the nature of their conversation. The knowledge of Speaker B's feelings of jealousy towards Speaker A's ability to go out highlights the social dynamics between them, although it might be less directly useful for immediate response generation. Speaker A's occupations and preferences (guitar player, likes jam time) add depth to the character but are not directly necessary for the immediate next response.\n\nOverall, most of the information is useful and relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, and the MEMORY contains naturally connected sentences showing the previous interactions of both speakers."
