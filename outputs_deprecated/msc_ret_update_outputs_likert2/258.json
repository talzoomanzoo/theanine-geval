Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you? Speaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses. Speaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set? Speaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up. Speaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe? Speaker B: There is some weird chemical mix that I really do not mess with.  It is easy to clean up.  I try to stay away from this part of the movies.  I know what it should look like and that we want to keep everyone safe when using the fake blood. Speaker A: Chemicals!  Do the actors hate working with it then?  I can imagine they are a pretty high maintenance bunch.  Do they worry about the blood messing with their looks? Speaker B: Our actors are pretty amateur.  No big name ones so they are really good to work with.  Hey, how about you?  How is your interview practice going?  I am pretty sure you be excellent during it!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\n2. Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them.\n3. Speaker A is preparing for an upcoming interview and is nervous about it.\n4. Speaker A has recently received a call for a job interview and is excited about it.\n5. Speaker A prefers classic horror movies like Halloween or Friday the 13th over modern ones.\n6. Speaker A also likes mid-century design and is a fan of horror movies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you for asking! The interview practice is coming along. I'm getting more comfortable with it, but the nerves are still there. Your support means a lot. And it's great to hear that your actors are easy to work with; it must make the whole process smoother.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains some relevant information, particularly points 3 and 4, about Speaker A preparing for and being nervous about an upcoming interview. This relates to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B inquires about Speaker A's interview practice. However, the other points in the MEMORY, such as Speaker A's preferences for classic horror movies or mid-century design, and Speaker B creating horror movies with their dad, do not directly connect with the ongoing dialogue or offer clear causal relationships with the topics being discussed. While these details provide some background, they do not directly contribute towards generating the next response based on this specific dialogue context. Therefore, the MEMORY is moderately but not optimally helpful."
