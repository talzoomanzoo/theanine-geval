Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin! Speaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name?  Speaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls! \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Marmalade.\n2. Speaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten.\n3. Speaker B is not a cat person but ends up taking care of stray cats brought home by kids.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B have a light-hearted and humorous conversation about their pets and travels.\n5. Speaker A enjoys drinking tea and water.\n6. Speaker B is excited for the trip and looking forward to trying the best iced tea.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about speakers' previous interactions, but most of it lacks direct relevance to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The fact that Speaker A has a cat and was considering naming a kitten Marmalade is somewhat relevant, but the details about Speaker A enjoying tea or Speaker B's interest in iced tea do not contribute to understanding the current discussion about the kitten's name change to Pumpkin. Additionally, while there is mention of a light-hearted and humorous conversation about pets, it does not effectively connect past interactions with the current discussion about names. Overall, the relevancy and natural connection of MEMORY to the Dialogue Context is limited, leading to a low helpfulness score."
