Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive. Speaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price? Speaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music Speaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it. Speaker A: I'll keep trying! Have you had any luck lately? Speaker B: No I haven't! I keep hoping that I will so I can buy my dreamhouse but I know the chances are low. Speaker A: Would you move to the city? It'd be too much for me\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n3. Speaker B bought 20 lotto tickets with the same numbers, aiming to get a bigger share of the jackpot if they win.\n4. Speaker A bought 50 lotto tickets with different numbers to increase their chances of winning.\n5. Speaker B's children have been sick, and Speaker B also had a fever, possibly influencing their decision to buy 20 lotto tickets.\n6. Both speakers dream of having a city and country house or a summer and winter home.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I think I'd prefer a country house, actually. Somewhere peaceful and away from the hustle and bustle. A place to relax and unwind.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be helpful for Speaker B in generating a next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It adds details about both speakers' interest in the lotto, which is a topic that has come up in their conversation. Specifically, the MEMORY highlights their different strategies for buying tickets and suggests that Speaker B has family responsibilities that may influence their purchase decisions. Moreover, the dream of owning multiple homes mentioned in the MEMORY aligns with Speaker B's mention of wanting to buy a dream house.\n\nHowever, MEMORY could be better structured for clarity and causality. The connection between Speaker B's personal life (sick children and fever) and lottery ticket buying doesn't naturally flow and isn't directly discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which might make the MEMORY seem somewhat disjointed. To receive a higher score, the MEMORY content should be more closely aligned with the natural flow of conversation and directly related to ongoing dialogue to fully support Speaker B's next response generation."
