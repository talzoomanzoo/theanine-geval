Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing?

    "raw_prediction": "That's exciting to hear about your upcoming trip to Italy! I don't have any plans to go back to Italy at the moment, but I would love to visit Greece someday to immerse myself in the history and Greek mythology. California is also a great destination if you're considering other options for your trip!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY is quite helpful in generating a next response for Speaker B, as it contains relevant information connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY confirms that Speaker B has an interest in Greek mythology and Greece itself (points 1 and 5), which relates directly to the conversation topic initiated by Speaker A about sharing Greek mythology with Speaker B's daughter. Additionally, the fact that Speaker B has been to Italy before (point 4) connects to the inquiry about future Italy trips. There's a mention of Speaker A planning to travel to Italy and having interests in history (points 2 and 3), which is somewhat relevant, as it ties into the conversation about traveling. However, point 6 about California as a travel destination is less directly relevant to the current dialogue specific focus. Overall, the MEMORY provides a useful background to guide a response, but not all elements are equally connected or pivotal to the ongoing dialogue."
