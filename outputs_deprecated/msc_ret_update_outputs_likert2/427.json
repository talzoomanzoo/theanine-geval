Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing? Speaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha! Speaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes? Speaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe.  Speaker A: You make them sounds so fascinating. Will you take them with you to your college dorm? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel.\n2. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans.\n3. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n4. Speaker A's interest in neuroscience was further fueled by their experience in a research lab and being in the Eagle Scouts.\n5. Speaker A is interested in scuba diving and neuroscience, with experience in a research lab.\n6. Speaker B goes to Hawaii for scuba diving and is considering studying marine life or a different type of animal.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for understanding Speaker B’s character and interests, which can guide the generation of a response. Sentence 1 directly connects to DIALOGUE CONTEXT by mentioning the names of Speaker B’s pet snakes. Sentence 6 also relates since it suggests Speaker B's broader interest in animals, aligning with their fascination for reptiles. However, the other sentences primarily focus on Speaker A’s interests and background, which do not directly aid in creating a response to Speaker A's last question about taking the snakes to the college dorm. The MEMORY lacks a clear, natural connection between these past interactions and the current dialogue context, hence it does not score higher."
