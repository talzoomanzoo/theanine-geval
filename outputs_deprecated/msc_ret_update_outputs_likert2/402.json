Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n2. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n3. Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves by using technology or watching TV.\n4. Speaker A suggests taking naps during quiet times and mentions watching her grandkids.\n5. Speaker A enjoys watching Jeopardy with their grandchildren and cooking for them, with the busiest time being the weekend.\n6. Speaker B is a parent to a young son who keeps them busy throughout the day.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "Yes, it was a nice change of pace. Sometimes a quiet afternoon with a good book is just what I need after keeping up with my energetic grandkids.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It confirms that Speaker A has grandchildren and spends time watching them, which connects to the fact that they didn't watch them today. This provides context for why they had time to check out a new book. Additionally, mentions of the grandchildren being old enough to entertain themselves could potentially link to why Speaker A took a break. However, several details (like Speaker A's enjoyment of watching Jeopardy and cooking, or how Speaker B has a young son) are not particularly relevant to the immediate context and could clutter the focus. The causality and relevance are moderately clear in parts, so a middle score seems appropriate."
