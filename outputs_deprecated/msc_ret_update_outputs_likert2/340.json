Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it!

I love all my students, because they really get into the lectures and ask lots of questions. Yes, my job requires me to watch movies all the time, so that is how I find the best ones.

    "raw_prediction": "That's fantastic to hear about your Film Studies professor job! It must be so fulfilling to share your passion with eager students. My programmer job is going well, thank you for asking. It's always interesting to hear about your movie recommendations and how your job influences them.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that could help in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures a few key points: Speaker B's expertise in movies (\"Film Studies professor,\" \"knowledgeable about movies\"), and that Speaker A relies on Speaker B for movie recommendations. However, the MEMORY could be more helpful by providing more detailed information or insights directly related to the current discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's love for teaching and how it influences their movie choices, or more about the preferences and history of movies discussed between both speakers. The MEMORY could also benefit from being more structured or connected to provide a clearer snapshot of the speakers' interaction history and make the context for future dialogue more apparent."
