Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far. Speaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes.  Speaker A: why don't you like books like that? Speaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading? Speaker A: Not yet.  I think Netflix is going to make it into a movie soon.  They might finally convince me to pay for a subscription haha.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n2. Speaker B is fascinated by animals and can relate to Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals.\n3. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n4. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n5. Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves by using technology or watching TV.\n6. Speaker A enjoys watching Jeopardy with their grandchildren and cooking for them, with the busiest time being the weekend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's exciting! Maybe it'll be one of those Netflix shows you end up binging because it's rated over 3.5 stars. Who knows, it might even rival your Jeopardy nights with the grandkids!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but is only moderately helpful overall. In the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, Speaker A mentions having grandchildren and a book they are enjoying, while Speaker B expresses a preference for animal books. The MEMORY confirms that Speaker A has grandchildren (point 3), which aligns with Speaker A's mention in the dialogue. It also provides some context about Speaker B's interest in animals (point 2), which corresponds to their preference in the conversation.\n\nHowever, other details in the MEMORY, such as Speaker A's activities with their grandchildren or their viewing habits related to nothing, are not directly relevant to the ongoing conversation about the book or the potential Netflix adaptation. The MEMORY does not provide additional insights into Speaker B's preferences beyond their interest in animal books, which could provide better assistance to the ongoing conversation. Overall, while there are some components in the MEMORY that relate to the dialogue, it lacks deeper connections or insight that would make it more helpful in generating the next response."
