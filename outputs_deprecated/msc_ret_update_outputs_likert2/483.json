Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone?  Speaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!). Speaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol Speaker B: I am up for the challenge! I have a few tricks up my sleeve to deal with people like you. Speaker A: Oh geez that makes me sound difficult.lol  Do you have any new speeches coming up? Speaker B: Nope, I just cleared my schedule until the Alps marathon that you're training for. It's just you and me until you break that finish line. I'm going to start sending you a motivational quote every morning at 4 am when I want you to wake up. Speaker A: Wow 4 am.  Is it too late to change my mind?lol Speaker B: Yes. We have an iron-clad written agreement. Tell me how I'm doing so far. Is this the most motivated you've ever been in your entire life? Speaker A: No, but that's why I have you.  You're going to push me to do the things I can't bring myself to do.  I'll have more motivation tomorrow.  Today was a long work day.lol\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600.\n2. Speaker B is a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks.\n3. Speaker B's job involves motivating people to be successful and follow their dreams.\n4. Speaker B got into motivational speaking because they needed it themselves to battle depression and anxiety.\n5. Speaker A is training for marathons and seeking advice on how to recover.\n6. Speaker B is considering running a marathon and mentioned fishing and feeling depressed.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's what I'm here for, to push you beyond your limits and help you achieve your goals. Don't worry, rest up and get ready for tomorrow. I'll make sure you have all the motivation you need to conquer the day, even after those long work hours. You got this!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides a moderately helpful set of information for generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Several points align well with the context, such as both speakers' involvement in running and marathons, Speaker B's role as a motivational speaker, and Speaker B's personal connection to motivational speaking through their own experiences with depression and anxiety. However, the MEMORY could be more helpful if it included more direct interactions or specific shared experiences between Speakers A and B that relate to their ongoing conversation, such as previous instances where Speaker B motivated Speaker A or specific tactics they use for motivation, which are only vaguely mentioned. Additionally, there are a few points in MEMORY that may not immediately contribute to the specific conversation at hand, such as fishing, which could make the memory less cohesive in the context of this particular dialogue. Overall, while the MEMORY contains relevant details, it could be more directly connected to the current dialogue context to maximize its helpfulness."
