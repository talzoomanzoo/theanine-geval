Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play?  Speaker B: I don't know play instrument.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY does contain some relevant information that could potentially be helpful, such as Speaker B's interest in surfing and Speaker A's background with the beach and surfing. However, the connection between these memories and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is weak. The MEMORY lacks a strong causality or relevancy to the ongoing conversation about music and instruments. While there is a small link about surfing lessons, and Speaker B's interest in surfing mentioned in the dialogue, the rest of the memory, such as fishing and teaching Speaker A to fish and cook, are less relevant to the current context about music and surfing. Therefore, MEMORY provides limited helpfulness in generating a proper next response for the given context."
