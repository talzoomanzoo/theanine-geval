Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies! Speaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?   Speaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere! Speaker B: You have a point.  It is nice to see puppies wagging their tail and just following you!  Changing topics, do you have any recipes with asparagus?  You know, it's such a popular vegetable, but I just don't know how to prepare it. Speaker A: I don't have recipes but I know how to make a good grilled asparagus. Are you looking to bolster your chef book?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys grilling indoors and suggests grilled asparagus with lemon on it.\n2. Speaker A mainly cares for dogs at the animal shelter, but also cats, and loves when new puppies are brought in.\n3. Speaker A enjoys cooking, especially making fajitas, and also volunteers at animal shelters.\n4. Speaker B is interested in volunteering and prefers cats over dogs, especially kittens.\n5. Speaker B is interested in becoming a chef but hasn't had the time to apply for jobs.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B are excited about the idea of traveling the world and trying different cuisines.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I would love to add a grilled asparagus recipe to my chef book! It sounds like a delicious and healthy option. Maybe we can try it out together sometime.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information for Speaker B's next response and is mostly well connected. Sentences 1 and 3 are directly related to the current dialogue topic about cooking and preparing asparagus, which is useful for Speaker B seeking culinary advice. Sentences 2 and 4 offer context on their preferences for animals, tying into the initial discussion about puppies and kittens; they help explain their respective viewpoints on pets. Sentence 5, while not immediately tied to the current dialogue, does provide insight into Speaker B's interest in cooking, supporting the query about recipes. Sentence 6 is less directly related but indicates the speakers' shared interest in culinary experiences, which could be useful if the conversation continues in that direction. Overall, the MEMORY is structured cohesively, but a more direct relevance to the specific dialogue context could enhance the rating further."
