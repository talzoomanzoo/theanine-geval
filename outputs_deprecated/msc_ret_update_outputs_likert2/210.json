Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships! Speaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!   I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field? Speaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate? Speaker B: I have another year- so this year is really important I get internships and start making connections in the field.   I love going to the beach too.  What happened with your knees that now cause you so much pain?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is offering advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field.\n2. Speaker B is looking for internships in the sports medicine field and has asked professors for letters of recommendation.\n3. Speaker B is interested in sports medicine and enjoys surfing.\n4.

    "raw_prediction": "It's great that you're already planning ahead for internships. As for my knees, it's just wear and tear from years of hiking and being active. Surfing could be a good way for you to relax and network. Have you tried reaching out to any sports medicine clinics or local teams for internship opportunities?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant background information about the interests and aspirations of Speaker B, which are connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY includes details such as Speaker B's interest in sports medicine, their internship search, and their enjoyment of surfing. These can be leveraged by a language model when crafting responses that maintain the flow of conversation about career development and personal interests. Furthermore, the MEMORY mentions Speaker A’s enjoyment of hiking and certain physical limitations due to knee issues, connecting to the query Speaker B had about Speaker A's knee condition in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, some sentences in the MEMORY feel somewhat disjointed or repetitive without clearly demonstrated causality, like Speaker A’s suggestion about surfing and Speaker A's hiking habits, which do not strongly connect with the current ongoing discussion. Hence, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful but could be more cohesive and directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
