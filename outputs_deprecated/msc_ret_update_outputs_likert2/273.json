Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys Greek mythology and did a case study on Poseidon, the God of the Sea, Earthquakes, and Horses.\n2. Speaker B does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology.\n3. Speaker B has a child referred to as \"the little monster\" and is a parent.\n4. Speaker A is fascinated by the architecture of Italy and enjoys studying history, especially through reading and watching documentaries.\n5. Speaker B's daughter is lucky to grow up close to the beach, only a fifteen-minute walk away.\n6. Speaker B appreciates the idea of superhuman powers and is interested in historical events that involve such figures.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "Yes, she's doing well, thank you for asking! I have started introducing her to Greek mythology through children's books and animated shows. She's quite fascinated by the stories of gods and goddesses.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It clearly indicates that Speaker B enjoys Greek mythology (point 1) which directly relates to the context of whether they have shared this interest with their daughter. Point 5 about the daughter growing up close to the beach could imply an environment where stories about Poseidon might be fascinating to her, indicating the child might already have been introduced to Greek mythology. Points 2 and 6 show Speaker B's interests in history and mythology, which supports the likelihood of sharing this interest with their daughter. However, other details like Speaker A's interest in Italian architecture (point 4) are not directly relevant to guiding the next response related specifically to the daughter and Greek mythology, keeping it from a perfect score. Overall, the MEMORY is well-connected and mostly relevant, making it helpful in generating a response."
