Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is in a band and plays music, possibly a musician.\n2. Speaker A is part of a band that tours different countries for their music.\n3. Speaker A is in a band where they play the drums and write music, with 4 members including the singer who is their best friend.\n4. Speaker A enjoys eating fish, particularly salmon or tuna.\n5. Speaker B is willing to teach Speaker A how to fish and cook.\n6. Speaker A is allergic to strawberries.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides detailed and relevant information that could be beneficial for Speaker B to generate a response. It clearly outlines Speaker A's involvement in a band, their role as a drummer and songwriter, and their touring experience, which are all directly relevant to the question about instruments. This information is naturally connected and gives depth to Speaker A's musical background, which could guide Speaker B in asking more informed and engaging questions or offering related topics for conversation. However, points 4, 5, and 6 about Speaker A's food preferences and allergies, while potentially interesting, don't directly inform the current dialogue about musical instruments. Hence, the MEMORY is not fully optimized for the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, leading to a slightly reduced score."
