Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like. Speaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk? Speaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is a city dweller who walks to work instead of driving.\n2. Speaker B lives in the country, loves nature, and works with animals.\n3. Speaker B enjoys reading the Odd Thomas and Dark Tower series and finds inspiration for their artwork during nature walks.\n4. Speaker A asks about Speaker B's new artwork and acknowledges their need for inspiration.\n5. Speaker A is a fan of the Game of Thrones series and enjoys audiobooks.\n6. Speaker A recommends the new album by Highly Suspect to Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that Speaker B is someone who loves nature and works with animals, which ties into the nature walk conversation. Additionally, it mentions that Speaker B finds inspiration for artwork during nature walks, which could be a potential talking point for Speaker A in their response. However, many other sentences in MEMORY, like Speaker A's commuting habits, their preferences for Game of Thrones and audiobooks, and an album recommendation, do not strongly relate to the current context about the nature walk and do not provide a direct causality or developmental link to assist Speaker B in generating a more relevant response. Overall, the MEMORY has useful details, but its helpfulness is limited by extraneous, less relevant information."
