Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think? Speaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons Speaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use. Speaker B: I am a little scared of needles though. Were your tattoos painful? Speaker A: Most of them were not.  It really depends on where on your body you get them.  Most of mine are on areas that didn't hurt.  The one on my foot and the one behind my ear did hurt a good bit.  Where were you thinking about getting it? Speaker B: I hadn't really thought about it! Maybe upper arm or upper back? But I'm no tattoo expert. And I'd have to get permission from my wife first, LOL Speaker A: Definitely talk to her first.  I had a friend that didn't talk to his wife and just came home with a tattoo one day.  It led to a huge fight - both about the money he spent and not discussing it with her.  He slept on my couch for over a week!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father.\n2. Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\n3. Speaker A works at a coffee shop and is saving up for their next tattoo.\n4. Speaker B enjoys fishing and wishes their wife and sons could have joined them on the trip.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B have a conversation about their personal interests and trips they have taken for work.\n6. Speaker A works at a coffee shop that their mom owned.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information that can assist in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Notably, MEMORY lines 1 and 2 provide context about Speaker A's intentions and past interactions related to tattoos, which is immediately relevant to the conversation about tattoos in the dialogue. These details help understand Speaker A's perspective and reasoning behind getting a tattoo for their dad, and possibly for their mom. \n\nHowever, the rest of the MEMORY lines (3, 4, 5, and 6) are not directly relevant or connected to the current dialogue context. For instance, Speaker A's job at a coffee shop (lines 3 and 6), and Speaker B's fishing interests (line 4) do not tie directly into the conversation about tattoos. Line 5 provides a vague reference to mutual personal interests but lacks specifics that could contribute to the discussion at hand.\n\nThus, while the MEMORY partly supports the dialogue context by providing background information about tattoos relevant to Speaker A, the entire MEMORY's contribution is somewhat limited, reducing the coherence and relevance across other interactions noted here."
