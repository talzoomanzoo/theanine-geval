Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam? Speaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n2. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n3. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n4. Both speakers value good grades and believe it can lead to better job opportunities.\n5. Speaker B feels overwhelmed by their mother's strictness and is eager to finish school to escape it.\n6. Speaker A advises Speaker B to take breaks and prioritize their own happiness and well-being.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Don't be too hard on yourself. A B is still a good grade. It's great that you're already thinking about what you can do better next time. Just keep pushing yourself, and I'm sure you'll see even better results in the future.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides information that can be helpful in generating a contextually appropriate response. It reveals that Speaker B is studying sports medicine, which relates to the discussion about exams in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Moreover, it highlights Speaker B's pressure to maintain good grades due to their mother's expectations, which could influence how they respond to the questions about their exams. This understanding of Speaker B's background and their academic pressures can inform the language model in crafting a response that acknowledges these aspects. However, not all the points in the MEMORY are directly relevant to the specific context, thus not earning a perfect score. Still, most of the sentences are logically connected and provide a clear narrative that helps in understanding Speaker B's situation."
