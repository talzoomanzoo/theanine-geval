Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n2. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n3. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n4. Speaker A's schedule at the restaurant includes working doubles on Saturdays and 8-hour shifts on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.\n5. Speaker A enjoys the interaction with people at work and the variety of experiences that come with it.\n6. Speaker B loves the beach and Mediterranean food.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's awesome! I can't wait to see the new dish. Maybe next time I visit your restaurant, I'll have to try it out too.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker A's work environment and conditions, such as the fact that Speaker A works at a restaurant, enjoys the work despite its busyness (sentences 1, 2), and has a demanding schedule (sentence 4). This background could help Speaker B generate a response related to Speaker A's excitement about the new menu item and their restaurant job. However, many details like Speaker A's specific free meal allowance or regular interactions with people (sentence 5), while interesting, do not directly contribute to developing a relevant response to the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 6 about Speaker Bâ€™s interests does not relate to the dialogue context. Overall, the MEMORY provides some context for Speaker A's enthusiasm but doesn't strongly establish causality or clear relevance directly tied to the immediate situation of adding a favorite dish to the menu."
