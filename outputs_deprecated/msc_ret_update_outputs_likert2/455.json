Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue. Speaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad. Speaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has devices to keep bugs away and offers to share the product names with Speaker B.\n2. Speaker B regrets their green and purple color scheme and is willing to give away their purple furniture.\n3. Speaker A is looking to redecorate their house and likes purple furniture.\n4. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n5. Speaker A is looking forward to spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing furniture and home decor choices.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That color scheme sounds refreshing. I was also considering a neutral palette with pops of green or yellow. Your bug-repelling lamp sounds interesting, that would definitely come in handy during our barbecue night.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains sentences that are relevant and somewhat connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, Speaker A's mention of having devices to keep bugs away directly relates to the context where they discuss bringing bug spray due to bad mosquitos. Additionally, the discussion about color schemes and furniture is somewhat mirrored in MEMORY with entries about Speaker A and B regretting and liking certain color schemes and furniture.\n\nHowever, while MEMORY entries about furniture and home decor are related, the connection could be more explicitly evident. The MEMORY does offer relevant information but misses a stronger, clearer linkage or causality between specific past interactions and the ongoing conversation about the barbecue, guitar, color schemes, and bug issues. The sentences are somewhat naturally connected, which is why it scores a 4, but they are not perfectly seamless to merit a score of 5."
