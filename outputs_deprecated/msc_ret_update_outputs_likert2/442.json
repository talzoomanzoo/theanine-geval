Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class and enjoys it.\n2. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts.\n3. Speaker A is a martial arts teacher and student and is pursuing an athletic training degree in college.\n4. Both Speaker A and Speaker B are interested in martial arts and enjoy learning new things.\n5. Speaker A is a college student who teaches jiu-jitsu and is lactose intolerant.\n6. Speaker B is busy debugging software and is a runner.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides several useful pieces of information connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While it mentions Speaker A's involvement and enjoyment in martial arts, it also highlights Speaker B's related interest by mentioning their enrollment in a martial arts history class. This information is relevant as it suggests a shared interest between the speakers and can inform a natural next response emphasizing mutual interests. Additionally, the memory shows natural connections between Speaker A and B's activities and experiences related to martial arts, which could enrich their conversation. However, the mention of Speaker A's lactose intolerance and Speaker B's running and software debugging is less connected to the immediate context, which slightly detracts from the memory's relevance. Overall, the memory is generally helpful but could be more focused on the immediate context for a higher score."
