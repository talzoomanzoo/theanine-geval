Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n2. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n3. Speaker B is a professional in a practice, where it is illegal for them to have relationships with clients.\n4. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n5. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n6. Speaker A is married and has been for four years.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful information for generating a next response. Specifically, the fact that Speaker B is a therapist and has been working in their own practice for about six years (1 and 4) is directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Speaker B talks about their career decision. These details can help Speaker A respond meaningfully by potentially building on the topic of Speaker B's career. However, other pieces of information, such as Speaker A being married and knowing about horses or Speaker B's interest in Freudian theories and football, do not directly contribute to the current conversation's themes or flow. The MEMORY lacks a coherent structure that connects these aspects in a causally relevant way to the dialogue, reducing its overall helpfulness."
