Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer? Speaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys going to museums and trying different foods.\n2.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful information regarding the preferences and plans of both speakers, which could help in generating a relevant response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it mentions Speaker A's interest in museums and music concerts, as well as planning a trip to São Paulo, which aligns with the current topic of art museums in the dialogue. Additionally, it notes that Speaker B has already attended a concert and is planning more based on band announcements, which can be tied to their interest in music events. While the MEMORY does not specifically address Speaker B's immediate plans for art museums, it does suggest B's knowledge and recommendations concerning the Museum of Art of São Paulo, which could be helpful in the conversation. The MEMORY logically connects the shared interest in concerts and museums, though some sentences (such as the one about living in the city) are more tangential. Overall, the MEMORY contains relevant and coherent information that can enhance the dialogue."
