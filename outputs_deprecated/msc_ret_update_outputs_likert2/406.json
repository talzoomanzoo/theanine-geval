Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far. Speaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes.  Speaker A: why don't you like books like that? Speaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is fascinated by animals and can relate to Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals.\n2. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n3. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n4. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n5. Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves by using technology or watching TV.\n6. Speaker A was influenced by Alex Trebek and Ken Jennings to develop a love for books and reading.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides a moderate level of helpfulness for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains relevant information that Speaker B is fascinated by animals (sentence 1) and that Speaker A has grandchildren and sometimes watches them (sentences 4 and 5), which can be connected to the current conversation about books and grandchildren. However, other parts of the MEMORY, such as Speaker A's Netflix habits (sentence 3) and influence by Alex Trebek and Ken Jennings (sentence 6), do not directly contribute to developing the current dialogue topic about books or animal interests. Additionally, while some sentences are somewhat connected to the context, they do not clearly establish a cause-and-effect relationship or development in the interaction about books and movies, which could make it more helpful. Overall, the MEMORY provides a basis for continuing the conversation, but its utility is limited by the presence of less relevant information."
