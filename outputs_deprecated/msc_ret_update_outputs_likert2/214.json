Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships!

    "raw_prediction": "I've been fortunate to visit Italy, Spain, Germany, and the UK. Each country has its own charm and beauty. France and Ireland must have been wonderful to explore. It's great that you've had the chance to travel and experience different cultures.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but not all of it is useful for generating the next response. It includes information about Speaker B's interest in internships in sports medicine and how their professors are supportive, which might help in building a response related to internships. However, there are inaccuracies such as Speaker A suggesting surfing as a way to make connections in the medical field, which was not part of the context. Additionally, the MEMORY lacks in areas of discussing travel experiences and beach activities, which would have been helpful based on the context. Overall, the connections between past interactions and current conversations are not well-represented."
