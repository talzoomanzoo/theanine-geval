Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden. Speaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways? Speaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there? Speaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot.  Speaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden? Speaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends. Speaker A: That sounds nice! So how is your job going? Speaker B: Always interesting, that's for sure! I have been training to nurse on a new floor, so that'll give me a change of scenery. Speaker A: Does that add a lot of extra work to your plate? Speaker B: At the moment, yes. I'll be in Pediatrics, which has always been my passion. It's a completely different environment than the ER.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n4. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n5. Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n6. Speaker B's parents still live in Sweden, and they find it expensive to travel there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information that is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 2 and 3 are directly related, confirming that Speaker A indeed has a cousin in Sweden, which is mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 4 is marginally useful as it suggests why Speaker B might have interest or knowledge about Sweden, complementing Speaker B's statement about loving local beach spots in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 5 provides context on the financial aspect of traveling to Sweden, which ties back to Speaker A's attempt to plan financially. However, several sentences are less pertinent, such as sentence 1, which inaccurately implies both speakers are planning to travel together, and sentences 4 and 6, which don't provide clear utility in the current conversation. The coherence and relevancy could be improved for a higher score."
