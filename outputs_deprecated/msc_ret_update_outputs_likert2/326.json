Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume. Speaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment.  Speaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully.\n2. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next.\n3. Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n4. Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks.\n5. Speaker A volunteers at a hospital and enjoys making origami crafts, specifically a 3D modular swan with glue.\n6. Speaker B is interested in making origami animals and finds the idea cute.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Definitely! Your success is inspiring. I think I might give it a try soon. Maybe I'll start with something simple like a paper crane. Thank you for offering to teach me!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful information to generate a response. It indicates Speaker A's enthusiasm and skill for origami, which connects to the dialogue context of them winning an origami contest. It also mentions that Speaker B is interested in origami animals, aligning with Speaker A's question about Speaker B trying origami. The mention of Speaker A offering to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks can tie into the dialogue if Speaker B expresses interest in learning. However, some sentences might have inconsistencies or redundant information, such as Speaker A making a Lotus flower already and also planning to make it next, which slightly impacts the natural flow. Overall, the MEMORY is relevant and connected to the context, aiding in crafting a response."
