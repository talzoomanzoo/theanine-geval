Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself! Speaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food? Speaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too? Speaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid.\n2. Speaker A mentions having dogs and Speaker B admires them for their peaceful nature.\n3. Speaker B has two terrier dogs as pets.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B share a love for music and plan to have a house concert with their pets.\n5. Speaker B asks Speaker A if they have had a pet raccoon before.\n6. Speaker A has a pet raccoon and has a friend who found baby raccoons.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Sid surprisingly doesn't have much of an interest in human food, which is a relief. I guess I lucked out there! But he does love to bask in the sunlight near the window, it's adorable.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains information that is partially relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it mentions Speaker A's pet raccoon named Journey, which directly relates to the incident of Journey eating the pizza. Additionally, the mention of Sid, a bearded dragon, connects to the final question Speaker B asks about Sid getting into food, though the MEMORY doesn't indicate whether Sid ever tries to get into food.\n\nHowever, there are unrelated details such as the house concert with pets, dogs' peaceful nature, and previous mention of a pet raccoon, which don't provide additional context or causality related to the current conversation about pets getting into food.\n\nOverall, MEMORY has some relevant portions but needs better organization or more directly related events to be very helpful in generating the next response."
