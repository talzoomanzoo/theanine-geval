Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it. Speaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout.\n2. Speaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat.\n3. Speaker B is a member of the boy scouts and works at a fast food place\n4. Speaker B plans to earn the Eagle Scout badge for college applications.\n5. Speaker B is busy with scouts, school, work, and tennis, but willing to take vacation days for the retreat.\n6. Speaker A is involved in church activities and mentioned a church retreat\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds really valuable for kids to learn. Maybe I should look into getting them involved in Boy Scouts. Hey, speaking of retreats, are you still up for joining the youth retreat next month?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a range of relevant details that can aid in generating a proper response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes Speaker B's long-term involvement with the Boy Scouts and notes their commitment to progressing to an Eagle Scout, which aligns with Speaker B's comments about the skills and activities acquired through scouting. Furthermore, Speaker A's appreciation for Speaker B's involvement and the mention of a youth retreat could be useful for developing conversational continuity or discussing future engagements.\n\nHowever, some details in the MEMORY, such as Speaker B's work at a fast food place and their involvement in tennis, though potentially useful, do not directly connect to the current context about Boy Scouts and survival skills. Nonetheless, the MEMORY captures a snapshot of relevant past interactions and commitments that could naturally lead to the evolution of their conversation regarding camping and retreats. This provides a solid foundation for generating a coherent next response, justifying a high score but short of perfect due to minor tangential elements."
