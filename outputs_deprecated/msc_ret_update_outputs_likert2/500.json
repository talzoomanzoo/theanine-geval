Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive. Speaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price? Speaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music Speaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\n3. Speaker A bought 50 lotto tickets with different numbers to increase their chances of winning.\n4. Speaker B bought 20 lotto tickets with the same numbers, aiming to get a bigger share of the jackpot if they win.\n5. Speaker B's children have been sick, and Speaker B also had a fever, possibly influencing their decision to buy 20 lotto tickets.\n6. Speaker A enjoys the peace and quiet of country life, the fresh produce, and fresh air.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That would be amazing! Imagine winning the lotto and being able to enjoy more music on a brand new iPhone without worrying about the cost. It's a nice thought to have, isn't it?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that can be useful to generate responses in the ongoing conversation, specifically regarding the mention of buying lotto tickets, which connects to Speaker B's joke about winning the lotto to help pay for the iPhone. The memory outlines the speakers' shared interest in the lottery and details their strategies, allowing Speaker A to potentially further engage on this topic. However, not all sentences in the MEMORY contribute directly to the dialogue context, such as Speaker B's family being sick or Speaker A enjoying country life, which feel disconnected. The memories about the lotto strategy are somewhat helpful, but the causality and natural flow within the context are not fully realized or explored. Some parts feel like disconnected details rather than a naturally occurring conversation."
