Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens? Speaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month Speaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.  Where are you going on vacation?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend.\n2. Speaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss hobbies and interests, with Speaker A enjoying gardening and reading, and Speaker B enjoying visiting the zoo.\n4. Speaker A prefers cockatoos over kittens as pets.\n5. Speaker A has been to the zoo before and enjoys seeing exotic birds.\n6. Speaker A is focused on saving money and not planning to have children in the near future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that could be useful for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, points 1 and 2 are somewhat related to the context of Speaker B considering adopting a kitten, which may influence the vacation-related conversation. However, the MEMORY also includes pieces of information that are not directly relevant to the immediate dialogue context, such as hobbies and interests which do not contribute significantly in continuing the conversation about vacations or kitten adoption. The connections and causality between certain items in the MEMORY do not appear strong, particularly for the present dialogue context, leading to a middle-range score."
