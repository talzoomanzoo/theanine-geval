Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it! Speaker B: I'm glad you liked it. My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to? Speaker A: I recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca. It was super cute and made me want to go visit Italy, but that was too expensive, so instead I booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month. What about you? Speaker B: I have been relaxing with the kids as much as I have. My husband has been busy with work, so we haven't had time for anything big. I would love to visit Italy some day though if we get the chance. Have you ever been to Italy before?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has seen the Disney movie 'Luca' recently.\n2. Speaker B's kids enjoyed watching 'Luca' and said it was good.\n3. Speaker B's husband enjoys Disney sports movies, such as 'Miracle'.\n4. Speaker B's kids enjoy watching Disney movies, which Speaker B also finds good.\n5. Speaker B enjoys watching movies with her kids.\n6. Speaker A has booked a \"Hawaii Sunset\" tour for next month, being excited about it being their first time.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "No, I've never been to Italy before, but watching Luca definitely made me want to go. Hopefully, you'll get the chance to visit Italy in the future! Until then, I'm really looking forward to my Hawaii sunset tour. I'll be sure to share all the details with you when I get back!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information for a language model to generate a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes details about Speaker A and Speaker B's interests in Disney movies, which is relevant since the conversation mentions two Disney movies, \"Miracle\" and \"Luca.\" Memory 1 accurately reflects what was said by Speaker A in the dialogue. Memory 3 relating to Disney sports movies suggests a useful context for discussing films. However, the MEMORY fails to provide a clear causal connection between various points, which limits its helpfulness. It also contains some redundant information, like the enjoyment of Disney movies by Speaker B and her kids, which is mentioned multiple times in different ways but doesn't directly relate to the latest discussion about the travel destinations or further movie recommendations. The excitement Speaker A feels about the Hawaii tour is conveyed, although it could be naturally linked better with the discussion. Overall, though MEMORY contains relevant points, the lack of clear interconnections and some repetition limits its full potential in aiding with the conversation."
