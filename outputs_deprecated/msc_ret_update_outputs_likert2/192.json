Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make? Speaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days.

    "raw_prediction": "Birria tacos are delicious! They're a traditional Mexican dish made with tender, flavorful stewed meat typically served in a crispy taco shell with melted cheese. It's definitely worth trying if you enjoy Mexican cuisine. I can show you how to make them sometime if you'd like!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful context for understanding Speaker A and B's preferences and activities. It mentions that Speaker A enjoys cooking, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as they are discussing cooking and trying new foods. This information could help Speaker A generate a response about their shared interest in cooking. Additionally, knowing that Speaker B values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe ties back to the conversation about garlic chicken. However, other details in MEMORY, such as Speaker A's interest in drumming and surfing, do not have direct relevance to the current dialogue. The connections between the sentences in MEMORY are not fully developed to provide a continuous narrative or create strong causal links with the ongoing conversation."
