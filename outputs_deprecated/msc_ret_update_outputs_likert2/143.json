Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n2. Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys.\n3. Speaker B has a young daughter who is 8 years old and is becoming independent.\n4. Speaker B's daughter likes monkeys and is starting to assert her independence.\n5. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n6. Speaker B is away from their child and glad that the pets are with them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, she had a great time! She especially loved seeing the monkeys at the zoo.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant context for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It informs us that Speaker B is a parent who is actively pushing for a school field trip to the zoo because their daughter, who is 8 years old, likes monkeys and is becoming independent. This background information can help Speaker B respond by elaborating on their daughter's interest in the zoo post-trip, aligning with the question from Speaker A about whether the daughter liked the place.\n\nHowever, the relevance of other details is limited or less connected to the dialogue, such as the fact that Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo or that Speaker B is glad pets are with them while away from the child. These points do not directly contribute to the elaboration of Speaker B's response to the current dialogue context. Therefore, while some helpful details are present, the memory is not fully utilized or tightly connected."
