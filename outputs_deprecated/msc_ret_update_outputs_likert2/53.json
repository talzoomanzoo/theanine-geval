Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job! Speaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. Speaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?   Speaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone. Speaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you? Speaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know. Speaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient!  Speaker A: Wow, that gives me a completely different perspective. You'd really be ok with seeing me? You don't think it would be a conflict of interest since we're friends? Speaker B: No not at all but if you didn't feel comfortable talking to me I can recommend a couple of my colleagues who are just as brilliant\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n2. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n3. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n4. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n5. Speaker B is a professional in a practice, where it is illegal for them to have relationships with clients.\n6. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B could pay a fee to a ranch to take care of a horse.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's really reassuring to know. Thank you for being so open to helping me. I'll definitely consider it, and maybe I'll take you up on that offer. It's good to have options.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant pieces of information that could help in the continuation of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, it confirms Speaker B's background as a therapist and provides additional context about Speaker A's interest, which is horses â€“ this could tie into Speaker A's mention of finding therapy in riding horses. Furthermore, understanding Speaker B's experience in his field (six years in own practice) could be relevant if the dialogue continues into discussing professional experience or expertise. However, other memory points, such as Speaker B's interest in the Chiefs or the illegality of relationships with clients, are not directly pertinent or helpful in developing the current dialogue context and making natural connections in the conversation about therapy. Hence, the MEMORY is moderately helpful but not fully connected to the ongoing conversation."
