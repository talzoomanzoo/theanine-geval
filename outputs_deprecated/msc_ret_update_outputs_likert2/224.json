Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself! Speaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food? Speaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too? Speaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also? Speaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways? Speaker B: They've been better as I left my previous job so I'm spending more time with them, how do you manage to work full time and still keep those animals happy? Speaker A: I think working at the zoo so long has helped. Why did you leave your last job. Was that the one you were working in the warehouse? Sorry to hear about your dogs, it can be hard managing older animals.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mentions having dogs and Speaker B admires them for their peaceful nature.\n2. Speaker B has elderly terriers and is planning to leave their part-time job for a break before starting a new one.\n3. Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid.\n4. Speaker A works at a zoo and is willing to help Speaker B get an entry-level position there.\n5. Speaker A mentions that entry-level positions at the zoo involve cleaning enclosures and feeding less dangerous animals but offer decent pay, training, benefits, and assistance with schooling.\n6. Speaker A works at a zoo and has tried playing music for the white tigers and home concerts for their pets.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, it was the warehouse job. I just felt like I needed a change of pace before starting something new. And yes, caring for elderly pets definitely requires more time and attention. How did you end up working at the zoo in the first place?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that can potentially aid in generating a suitable response for Speaker B. For example, it mentions that Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey, which directly relates to the conversation about Journey eating a piece of pizza. Additionally, it notes that Speaker A works at a zoo, which could relate to their management of animals, something that has been part of the dialogue context. However, much of the MEMORY includes information that is not directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A playing music for white tigers or offering to help Speaker B get a position at the zoo. These points don't clearly connect to the dialogue's current focus and therefore do not directly contribute to developing the conversation on how Speaker B should manage their elderly dogs or furthering the discussion of Speaker A's pets. Furthermore, there is no indication in the MEMORY of Speaker B's admiration for the peaceful nature of Speaker A's pets, making it partially misaligned with the context. However, the sentence structures in the MEMORY are clear and coherent, allowing for some understanding of the relationship between Speaker A's background and the conversation's flow."
