Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam? Speaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A. Speaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now? Speaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done.  Speaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on? Speaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study? Speaker B: Ah, English should be easier than History. Sure, I can help you. What do you need to do exactly? Write an essay? Speaker A: Yeah, we have to write an essay and we have a spelling component towards the end of the exam, I sure could use a little help! Speaker B: No problem! I like correcting and editing essays. Although, it seems like your English is pretty good. I doubt you even need much help.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n2. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n3. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n4. Both speakers value good grades and believe it can lead to better job opportunities.\n5. Speaker B feels overwhelmed by their mother's strictness and is eager to finish school to escape it.\n6. Speaker A advises Speaker B to take breaks and prioritize their own happiness and well-being.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you for the offer! I appreciate your confidence in my English skills, but a second pair of eyes is always helpful. Plus, your expertise in sports medicine might bring a fresh perspective to my writing.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about the general academic pressures both speakers face and their values regarding grades, which can be tangentially related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about exams and studying. However, most of the specific details in MEMORY, such as Speaker B's sports medicine training and the relationship with their mother, do not directly help Speaker A generate the next response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the continuity and relevancy of some memories to the specific context of preparing for an English exam are limited. The connection between past interactions and the current conversation about English exams and finding proper support is not clearly demonstrated. Therefore, the MEMORY provides limited helpful information for generating a relevant and coherent response."
