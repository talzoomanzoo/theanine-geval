Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately? Speaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me. Speaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway? Speaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day! I'll make it as fun as possible. Speaker B: I will someday. just not in the summer when all the bugs are out! Where do you go hiking the most? Speaker A: I like to go hiking in the local trails here. I am familiar with them and there's so many routes that I can take. Sadly, the bugs are as bad here as they are anywhere else..... Speaker B: They can't be that bad in the fall right? I hope? Do you camp most every weekend? Speaker A: A least a couple of times a month. Sometimes, yeah, I go every weekend to relax. Being in nature is so relaxing to me. And nah the bugs aren't too bad in the fall and winter. There's a beautiful river along one trail that I bet you'd love to see.  Speaker B: That sounds like it would be relaxing. I would probable be okay if we didn't run into any wolves, bears etc. Have you ever came across any predators when you were camping?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys camping trips and looking for wild animals in the woods.\n2. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n3. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n4. Speaker A is comfortable around animals in the woods but admits a bear would make them jumpy.\n5. Speaker B dislikes bugs and is not a fan of camping, hiking, or the outdoors.\n6. Speaker A enjoys hiking, birdwatching, and spotting rare animals.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I have encountered some smaller predators like raccoons and foxes, but thankfully no wolves or bears yet. I always make sure to follow proper safety precautions and keep my distance from any potentially dangerous animals. It's all part of the thrill of being out in the wild, though I admit a bear encounter would definitely make me a bit jumpy!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for Speaker A to generate a relevant response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. There are specific elements in the MEMORY that are directly relevant to the conversation. For instance, the information that Speaker B dislikes bugs and is not fond of the outdoors connects to their reluctance to join outdoor activities in the summer (Memory #5). The MEMORY also highlights Speaker A's interest in hiking and comfort around animals, which relates to their enjoyment of local trail hiking mentioned in the context (Memory #1, #4, #6). However, some parts of the MEMORY, such as Speaker B recently enjoying a long hike (Memory #2), do not align with the current context where Speaker B talks about not enjoying outdoor activities. Additionally, some details like planning to do a part of the Appalachian Trail (Memory #3) may not be immediately relevant to the given context. Therefore, MEMORY is not perfect but fairly helpful, earning a score of 4."
