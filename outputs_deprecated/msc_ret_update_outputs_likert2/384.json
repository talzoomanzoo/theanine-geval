Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think? Speaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons Speaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use. Speaker B: I am a little scared of needles though. Were your tattoos painful? Speaker A: Most of them were not.  It really depends on where on your body you get them.  Most of mine are on areas that didn't hurt.  The one on my foot and the one behind my ear did hurt a good bit.  Where were you thinking about getting it? Speaker B: I hadn't really thought about it! Maybe upper arm or upper back? But I'm no tattoo expert. And I'd have to get permission from my wife first, LOL\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father.\n2. Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\n3. Speaker A works at a coffee shop and is saving up for their next tattoo.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B have a conversation about their personal interests and trips they have taken for work.\n5. Speaker A works at a coffee shop that their mom owned.\n6. Speaker B enjoys fishing and wishes their wife and sons could have joined them on the trip.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Upper arm or upper back would be great spots for a tattoo! It's always good to consider your spouse's opinion too. It's a big decision, but it sounds like you're on the right track.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for Speaker A to generate a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The information that Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father, aligns with Speaker Aâ€™s intention to get a new tattoo for their mom. The detail that Speaker A works at a coffee shop, particularly one that their mom owned, might add sentimental value to the conversation, although it is not directly related to tattoos. Additionally, the reflection of a broader conversation about personal interests, as mentioned in MEMORY, might offer some context to understand their current dialogue dynamics. However, much of the MEMORY, such as the details about Speaker B's interests in fishing or their wife's and sons' involvement, doesn't directly tie into the tattoo discussion. Additionally, some aspects, like Speaker A saving for their next tattoo, could be potentially integrated into the conversation but are not directly relevant to the immediate discussion about tattoo locations or pain. Overall, MEMORY ties partially into the context and could be refined to reveal more direct causality or focus on the tattoo subject."
