Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?

    "raw_prediction": "My favorite zoo to visit is the San Diego Zoo. It's such a wonderful place with a wide variety of animals to see. Have you been there before?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information regarding both Speaker A and Speaker B's interest in the zoo. It mentions Speaker A's frequent visits to the zoo and their specific interest in animals like tigers and monkeys, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It also outlines Speaker B's involvement with the zoo, regarding family discounts and their daughter's interest, which could be helpful in understanding Speaker B's perspectives and motivations. However, the MEMORY lacks a clear and direct causal connection to the specific questions and statements in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as specific favorite zoos or camping preferences. Additionally, the suggestion of taking pets to the zoo (point 6) seems less relevant and slightly disconnected from the conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, the information in MEMORY is somewhat helpful but could be more directly connected to the ongoing dialogue, hence a score of 3."
