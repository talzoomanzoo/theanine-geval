Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college? Speaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position.  Speaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it? Speaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days.  Speaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living. Speaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime? Speaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play. Speaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n2. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.\n3. Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n4. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n5. Speaker A is a fan of Arsenal and enjoys watching international teams play.\n6. Speaker A is seeking career advice from a guidance counselor and is open to suggestions.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains information that is somewhat connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and provides context that could be helpful in generating Speaker A's next response. However, it falls short of scoring higher because it lacks natural connection and causality between events. Here's the breakdown:\n\n- Points 1, 2, and 3 about Speaker A being an active soccer player, especially as a striker, are potentially relevant as they indicate that Speaker A is deeply involved in soccer, which can motivate them to help Speaker B re-engage with the sport, as per their promise to reserve field time and bring friends. However, specific details about an upcoming match or scoring well aren't directly connected to the conversation about playing casually with friends.\n\n- Point 4 about Speaker B playing in college is directly relevant because it establishes Speaker B's past involvement in soccer, connected to their statement about not having played in a while and thus suspecting a casual game might be best.\n\n- Point 5 about Speaker A being an Arsenal fan could be a point of shared interest in the sport, but isn't directly relevant to the logistics of a casual soccer game or the discussion about it.\n\n- Point 6 is not particularly relevant to the current soccer-related discussion, as it diverges into career advice territory unrelated to the conversation.\n\nOverall, there is some contextual information that can aid in forming a response in line with the conversation, but it isn't as seamlessly linked or directly applicable to the discussion's causal flow as it could be."
