Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play?  Speaker B: I don't know play instrument.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provided includes some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly about Speaker B's interest in surfing (points 1 and 2) and about their interaction with Speaker A (points 3 and 4). MEMORY point 1 is particularly relevant as it directly relates to Speaker B's interest in learning to surf, which is a topic discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Point 2 also fits within this theme as it mentions Speaker B's intentions related to surfing. However, there are other pieces of information in the MEMORY that are not directly relevant to the ongoing conversation about fishing or learning different skills, such as points 5 and 6, which detracts from the overall helpfulness for generating a next response. The connection between MEMORY points is not particularly strong, as they come across as individual facts rather than a narrative of past interactions, leading to a middle-of-the-road score."
