Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you. Speaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them Speaker A: IN MY HOME?! A TREE? That was not at all what I was thinking. Do they grow well indoors? I am intrigued.  Speaker B: Well if you want to make it like a proper garden experience then I would suggest going all in, and go for the best most authentic looking items you could get  Speaker A: Wow! Ok! This is sounding like a bigger undertaking! Should I embrace bugs in the home if they help the plants or am I getting wild? Speaker B: Well from my experince bugs do the complete opposite and don't help at all, so avoid that at all costs! Fertilizers are the way to go to help with growth. Speaker A: Oh man. I have lots to learn. What is the lifespan of a plum tree? Speaker B: around 10 to 15 years but if you take care of them I'm sure you could get 20 out of it. Speaker A: Now we are also talking commitment! This is not how I expected my day to go! I am excited, yet so nervous!  Speaker B: It doesn't take too much time to do per day so after school give it a little water and that should keep them in great way. Speaking off school how are you getting on? Speaker A: Ok! I am putting my fate in your hands on this one. School is fine. I don't really pay attention to anything except band class.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing.\n2. Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden.\n3. Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more.\n4. Speaker A is a student who likes English in school and plays in the marching band.\n5. Speaker A's parents are teachers.\n6. Speaker A jokes about space weeds and expresses a desire to see space.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Band class can be a great escape from the academic side of things. It's nice to have something you enjoy so much. And remember, with your commitment to the garden, you'll soon find yourself enjoying the rewards of your hard work.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but lacks strong coherence in connecting the past interactions to the current context. \n\n1. The fact about Speaker A struggling with gardening is relevant as it matches the current dialogue where Speaker A is seeking suggestions and expressing nervousness about gardening. It reflects their lack of experience and curiosity about trying something new, like having a garden indoors.\n\n2. Speaker B's knowledge about plants and gardening is useful and complements the dialogue context, as Speaker B provides suggestions and advice about plum trees, fertilizers, and the potential challenges with bugs.\n\n3. Information about Speaker A being a student and their interest in the marching band touches upon the current context briefly when Speaker A mentions not paying attention to much except band class.\n\nHowever, MEMORY contains details that don't seem directly related to the current interaction, such as Speaker B's mention of weight gain and working more in the garden, and Speaker A's parents being teachers. These points could help expand on the characters if included naturally but appear isolated in the MEMORY.\n\nOverall, while there is some relevant information present, most of the MEMORY sentences do not clearly connect or contribute to the causality in this particular interaction."
