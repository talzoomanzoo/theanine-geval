Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue. Speaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has devices to keep bugs away and offers to share the product names with Speaker B.\n2. Speaker A is looking forward to spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights.\n3. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy barbecuing and have a love for pets.\n5. Speaker B plans to bring a new marinade and a six pack of beer for the gathering.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing furniture and home decor choices.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'd love to help you with your living room color scheme! And don't worry, I'll bring my bug repellent devices to keep those pesky mosquitoes away while we enjoy the music and barbecue.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful context that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly for generating a follow-up response. Several elements in MEMORY align with the upcoming barbecue mentioned in the context:\n- Sentence 1 is useful, as it relates to the bug spray Speaker B mentioned, indicating Speaker A has solutions for dealing with bugs.\n- Sentence 2 and 3 give a sense of Speaker A’s anticipation and plans for evenings with grilling and socializing, which ties into the gathering being discussed.\n- Sentence 5 provides additional detail that enhances the context of the gathering with Speaker B bringing a marinade and beer, supporting the theme of barbecuing.\n\nOverall, these sentences offer contextual data that can shape a realistic and coherent continuation, despite some details being tangential (e.g., sentence 6 around furniture and home decor). They tell a story of past interactions and anticipate future actions in the context of social gatherings, which can guide Speaker A’s response effectively."
