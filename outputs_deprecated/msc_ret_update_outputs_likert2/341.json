Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it! Thank you for the recommendation. Speaker B: Of course. I recommend that movie to everyone I meet. I think I've watched it over one hundred times. So what is the next movie on your list to watch soon? Speaker A: Yeah it was great and I will also recommend to people when they ask what movie is good. So next is another one you recommended which is coming to America. What’s the next movie your going to watch?  Speaker B: There is a horror genre movie that was released just this week which I'm going to watch tonight. It is called \"Girl Next.\" Speaker A: Oh that sounds interesting, I will look into that and put it on my list. How has your job been going? Is there where you get all these great ideas for what to watch?   Speaker B: My Film Studies professor job has been going absolutely great lately. I love all my students, because they really get into the lectures and ask lots of questions. Yes, my job requires me to watch movies all the time, so that is how I find the best ones. Is your programmer job going all right lately? Speaker A: That sounds amazing. Super lucky to have students that really enjoy what they are learning about and I’m sure that’s down to the way you teach and what you teach them. I’m so glad it is all going well for you. Yeah it is going much better now, I’m really getting in the swing of things thank you for asking. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is knowledgeable about movies and provides recommendations based on Speaker A's preferences.\n2. Speaker B used to teach Film Studies and carefully chooses what movies to watch.\n3. Speaker A is interested in watching movies, mentioned Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman.\n4. Speaker A relies on Speaker B for movie suggestions, mentioning a preference for comedies.\n5. Speaker B enjoys watching suspense films, action, SF, horror, westerns, drama, and occasional good comedy.\n6. Speaker B has kids and enjoys watching movies with them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate your kind words. Teaching film studies is truly my passion, and I'm glad it shows in my students' enthusiasm. I'm thrilled to hear that things are going better at your programmer job. Finding your stride in a new role can take some time, but it sounds like you're getting there. If you ever need a break from coding, I have a great comedy recommendation for you!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides a decent amount of relevant information to help Speaker B generate a proper next response, but there are some gaps that affect its helpfulness. The information in MEMORY is helpful because it mentions that Speaker B is knowledgeable about movies, which aligns with their profession as a Film Studies professor and their extensive movie-watching habits mentioned in the context. Furthermore, it notes that Speaker A relies on Speaker B for recommendations, which is connected to the context where Speaker A expresses appreciation for a previous movie recommendation. \n\nHowever, some of the details in MEMORY are either implied or not fully aligned with the specific conversation context. For instance, Speaker A's preference for comedies, as mentioned in MEMORY, is not directly relevant to the current conversation, which focuses on horror and general movie recommendations. Additionally, while it's noted that Speaker B enjoys watching movies with their kids, the current context doesn't cover family-oriented content. Overall, while MEMORY provides some relevant insights, it lacks a stronger connection and detailed relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, leading to a moderately helpful score."
