Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately? Speaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me. Speaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway? Speaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day! I'll make it as fun as possible. Speaker B: I will someday. just not in the summer when all the bugs are out! Where do you go hiking the most?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n2. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n3. Speaker A leads hikes for the group they camp with, which are usually an hour or two long.\n4. Speaker A is nervous about the Appalachian Trail hike, as they don't usually do full day hikes.\n5. Speaker A enjoys camping trips and looking for wild animals in the woods.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy being outdoors, but Speaker B prefers the fresh air over being in the mud and rain.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I understand, bugs can definitely be a nuisance. I mostly lead hikes in the local trails near our camping spot, but I'm planning a big trip this summer along the Appalachian Trail. It's going to be a challenge for me, but I'm excited to explore new terrains.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Several entries relate directly to hiking, which is the current topic of discussion between Speaker A and Speaker B. For example, entry 3, \"Speaker A leads hikes for the group they camp with, which are usually an hour or two long,\" provides information about Speaker A's experience and might be helpful in crafting a response about their hiking experiences. However, some entries, like entry 1, \"Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it,\" are contradictory to the claim in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Speaker B expresses that they are not a fan of the outdoors. This inconsistency detracts from the helpfulness. Additionally, some entries in the MEMORY, such as entry 6, mix compatible but broad information without strong relevance or a natural connection to the conversation about an upcoming hike, rather than about outdoor general preferences. Overall, the MEMORY offers some relevant details, but not all align well, and it lacks clarity in the progression or causality of events connected to the current dialogue context, thus it earns a middle score."
