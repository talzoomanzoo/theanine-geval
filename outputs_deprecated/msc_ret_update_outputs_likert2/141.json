Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job. Speaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career. Speaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday. Speaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud. Speaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach? Speaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option. Speaker A: Yes I think history is interesting, too! Both of those subjects would be great because there are probably lots of teaching jobs. What kind of history do you like? Speaker B: I love all sorts of history. Right now I am really getting into the weeds of World War II. There's so much to unpack. Speaker A: For sure! So much happened and it really affected how the world is today. I like learning about the history of places where I have lived, it's really interesting. Speaker B: That sounds really cool! What have you learned about where you currently live?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n3. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n4. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n5. Speaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\n6. Speaker B is part of a local amateur soccer team and used to play World of Warcraft a lot in high school and college.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that could potentially aid Speaker A in generating a response. For instance:\n\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science in robotics, which connects with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A mentions wanting to teach robotics someday.\n\n2. Speaker B's consideration of becoming a college professor in linguistics is tangentially related to the context of teaching, although their expressed current interest in teaching English or history is not directly addressed.\n\nHowever, many sentences in MEMORY do not naturally connect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT or exhibit clear causality or relevancy:\n\n- There is no mention of Speaker Bâ€™s current interest in history, which is a significant part of the dialogue.\n- Information about Speaker B volunteering and being involved in soccer and gaming history is not immediately relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making those aspects less helpful.\n  \nOverall, while MEMORY does provide some useful background information, the connection and relevance to the specific dialogue exchange are not strong enough for a higher rating."
