    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume. Speaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment.  Speaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon? Speaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think? Speaker A: It depends on what you are trying to make out of origami, you can make some super complicated stuff, there's actually special paper that you can get for it! You may have seen origami be used in the hospital for some breathing aperatus! Speaker B: That's amazing. I had no idea, but that totally makes sense. Do you have to practice a lot -- sort of a use it or lose it kind of thing? Speaker A: Yea, I think for the more complicated origami it's kind of a use it or lose it but for the simple stuff you can usually take a couple months of and still remember to do it! Did you see origami in Japan? Speaker B: Not up close, but I noticed a lot in shop windows in certain areas. I love Japan -- they're so welcoming. One of our acquaintances GAVE me a kimono. She said it's customary to try to share their culture. Kind of different from America in my opinion.   Speaker A: Oh, that sounds wonderful. It's impressive how much things that came from there and how giving a culture they are. America is definetly a lot different from them, have you visted different states in America? Speaker B: Oh yes. I live in North Carolina, but I've been to almost every state. Alaska was by far my favorite, but I'm kind of a loner and it feels like a lot of people there are, so maybe I just relate. But the scenery and landscapes are unbelievably beautiful. What's your favorite place you've been to?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A wishes to visit the country where origami was originally created, possibly Japan.\n2. Speaker B has visited Japan and found it to be an amazing country.\n3. Speaker B was recommended volunteering by Speaker A and has traveled to Japan and Italy, enjoying the art and food.\n4. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully.\n5. Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n6. Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's fascinating that you've traveled to so many states! My favorite place I've been to is definitely Japan. The culture, the scenery, and the overall atmosphere just left a lasting impression on me. I hope you get a chance to visit Japan one day too, I think you'd really enjoy it based on your love for origami and appreciation of different cultures.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides useful background information about Speaker A's interest and skills in origami, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT regarding Speaker A's achievement in an origami contest. Details like Speaker A's self-learning of origami and their offer to teach Speaker B are relevant and can aid in further discussions about origami. Additionally, Speaker B's travel experience to Japan, mentioned in MEMORY, connects to the ongoing conversation about origami's cultural context. However, some entries, such as those about Speaker B's travels to Italy and volunteering recommendation, may not directly impact the current dialogue about origami and cultural experiences. The MEMORY could benefit from more direct causal or sequential connections between points to flow better and enhance its helpfulness."
