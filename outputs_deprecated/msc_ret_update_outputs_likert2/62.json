Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like. Speaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk? Speaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous. Speaker B: That sounds amazing! Did you bring a pet? I love doing the harder trails with my dog. Sometimes, it's very peaceful to get away from everything. Speaker A: No, I don't have any pets; my apartment seems too small for a dog and I would worry about them being lonely all day when I'm at work. I was thinking about getting a pair of cats, but I haven't committed yet. How nice fo ryou to have company when you're walking though! What kind of dog do you have? Speaker B: Cats can be nice! I used to have cats, but am allergic to them and had to give them to my friend. I have an Australian Kelpie who is a rescue. She is very energetic and smart! Speaker A: I had cats as a child and I think that they're a bit easier to care for than dogs, especially in the city. I am a dog lover as well though; Australian Kelpies are gorgeous! What is her name? Does she walk well off-leash? Speaker B: Yes, cats are very smart and clean. Mine used to bring me a mouse to throw for her, just like a dog! And if you have 2 cats, they play with each other! Mine would run up and down the halls in the middle of the night, haha. Her name is Kyrie, and she walks off leash and is very obedient. Dogs might be hard to keep in your small apartment though, since Kyrie likes to play in the field, run with cars along the fence row, and herd goats. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B lives in the country, loves nature, and works with animals.\n2. Speaker A is a city dweller who walks to work instead of driving.\n3. Speaker B gets along somewhat with their sister.\n4. Speaker A also enjoyed reading 'Redwall' growing up and keeps an eye out for similar books.\n5. Speaker B enjoys reading the Odd Thomas and Dark Tower series and finds inspiration for their artwork during nature walks.\n6. Speaker A is a fan of the Game of Thrones series and enjoys audiobooks.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Kyrie sounds like such a spirited companion! It must be wonderful having her by your side during your nature walks. It's true, a dog might be a bit challenging to keep in my apartment, but I do admire the energy and loyalty they bring. Do you find that spending time with Kyrie helps inspire your artwork in any way?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some potentially relevant background information about the speakers, which could be useful for a language model to generate a response. For instance, knowing that Speaker A is a city dweller and walks to work gives some context about their lifestyle, which aligns with their concerns about having a pet in a small apartment. Similarly, Speaker B's enjoyment of nature and working with animals is relevant to the conversation about walking dogs and hiking. However, the MEMORY lacks direct reference to the specific dialogue context, which revolves around pets, nature walks, and living situations. Also, some details, like the reading interests and family dynamics (with sister), do not directly contribute to generating a relevant response based on the current dialogue context. The connections between these pieces of information are not clearly demonstrated, hence a lower score in terms of helpfulness."
