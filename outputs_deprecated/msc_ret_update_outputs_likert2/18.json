Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun! Speaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim.  Speaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you  Speaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises. Speaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you? Speaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it. Speaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car? Speaker B: Yes, there are several. Hope we could meet and You possibly teach me about computer programming.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n2. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n4. Speaker A is planning a snorkeling trip and has signed up for several trips.\n5. Speaker A plans to travel to the Caribbean for their next trip.\n6. Speaker A enjoys the food and the adventure of cruises.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a plan! We can combine your love for punk music, swimming, and programming while exploring new cities. It will be a fun and educational experience for both of us.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant points that could aid in generating the next response. For example, points 1 and 3 directly tie into the Dialogue Context, reflecting the conversation about swimming lessons and the potential cruise. However, some statements, like points 4 and 6, are not relevant to the current dialog context and do not aid in the conversation about swimming, programming, or the Caribbean trip. The MEMORY would be more helpful if it focused more on the immediate discussion topics in the dialogue context."
