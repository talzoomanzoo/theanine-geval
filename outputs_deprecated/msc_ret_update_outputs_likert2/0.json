Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n2. Speaker A is worried about gas mileage and asks about the fuel efficiency of Speaker B's car.\n3. Speaker B received a new car from their mom and plans to drive during spring break.\n4. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n5. Speaker B's new car is black, and it is their first new car after driving pre-owned cars before.\n6. Speaker A is older and mentions having blue hair already.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "No, I actually decided to drive instead of flying. I received a new car from my mom, so I'm excited to take it on a road trip during spring break.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, sentences 1 and 3 are relevant to the context of travel and might be useful for Speaker B's response regarding plane tickets. Sentence 1 indicates that Speaker B is going on a trip and has not started packing yet, which could relate to their plane ticket purchase status. Sentence 3 provides additional context about Speaker B receiving a new car, which may be relevant if they are considering driving instead of flying.\n\nHowever, other sentences in MEMORY are less directly tied to the plane tickets topic and may not benefit the response generation as much. For example, sentences 2, 5, and 6 discuss car details and Speaker A's characteristics, which are not directly related to the plane ticket purchase. Overall, MEMORY is somewhat helpful, but only some sentences contain relevant and naturally connected information pertaining to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
