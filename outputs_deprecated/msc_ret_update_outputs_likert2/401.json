Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n2. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n3. Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves by using technology or watching TV.\n4. Speaker A suggests taking naps during quiet times and mentions watching her grandkids.\n5. Speaker A is older and babysits their grandchildren about four days a week and most weekends.\n6. Speaker A enjoys watching Jeopardy with their grandchildren and cooking for them, with the busiest time being the weekend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful information that helps understand Speaker A's typical activities, which could inform Speaker B's response. For instance, knowing that Speaker A didn't watch their grandkids today allows for a reaction or inquiry about what other activities they decided to pursue. Points 1, 5, and 6 are particularly relevant because they mention speaker A's usual routine involving their grandchildren, which contrasts with today's activities and provides context for their decision to read a new book. Additionally, the connections between points (e.g., routine activities, watching TV, naps) are naturally presented, thus contributing meaningful context. However, some points like 2 and 3, although relevant, add slightly less to the immediate conversational context, focusing on broader habits instead of directly linking to the current situation. Overall, the MEMORY is helpful for generating a properly informed next response."
