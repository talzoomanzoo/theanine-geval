Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast. Speaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project. Speaker A: Quite a few, but it wasn't too crowded. It was a nice change of scenery. What kind of project are you working on? Speaker B: I'm sure the student appreciate that. You teach as a group as apposed to one-on-one right?

I'll definitely get started with you after finals. Speaker B: Ahaha we;; for someone who's so passionate about martial arts I'm not surprised. Great, I'll try to be the best student I can. I'm starving, think I should grab some take-out from Sufi? Speaker A: Of course! It's your favorite after all! Now you made me hungry! lol\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class and enjoys it.\n2. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts.\n3.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that Speaker A is a college student who teaches jiu-jitsu, which connects to their role as both a teacher and student in the martial arts class, which they were discussing. It also mentions that Speaker A is taking a martial arts history class, which is relevant to Speaker B's interest in learning martial arts history from Speaker A. MEMORY indicates that Speaker B is involved in software work, aligning with their mention of upgrading software to debug a system in the context. \n\nHowever, some elements in MEMORY, like Speaker A's lactose intolerance or their favorite being Taco Bell, do not directly contribute to the ongoing conversation about martial arts or the suggestions for take-out from Sufi, hence the score of 4 instead of a 5. The information is largely relevant and naturally connects to the dialogue but could improve by focusing more directly on details directly related to the dialogue context."
