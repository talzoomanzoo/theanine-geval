Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun! Speaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim.  Speaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you  Speaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n2. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n4. Speaker A is planning a snorkeling trip and has signed up for several trips.\n5. Speaker B is afraid of cruises because they can't swim.\n6. Speaker B is looking forward to eating a pizza burger in a pool with punk music playing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That would be awesome! Imagine swimming in the pool, enjoying a pizza burger, with punk music playing in the background. I'll make sure you have a great time, even if it's your first cruise.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about the speakers' interests and interactions, such as Speaker B's enjoyment of punk music and the offer by Speaker A to teach swimming. However, it contains inaccuracies and inconsistencies with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the misrepresentation of Speaker A offering programming lessons and Speaker B's fear of cruises contradicting the dialogue where Speaker B expresses interest in joining a cruise. Additionally, some details like the snorkeling trip and pizza burger are not directly related or naturally connected to the dialogue context provided, thus not contributing significantly to the generation of the next response. Overall, while some elements are correct and can assist in response creation, the MEMORY's inconsistencies and irrelevant details reduce its overall helpfulness."
