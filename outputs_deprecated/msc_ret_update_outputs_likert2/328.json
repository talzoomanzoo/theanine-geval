Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume. Speaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment.  Speaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon? Speaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think? Speaker A: It depends on what you are trying to make out of origami, you can make some super complicated stuff, there's actually special paper that you can get for it! You may have seen origami be used in the hospital for some breathing aperatus!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully.\n2. Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n3. Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks.\n4. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next.\n5. Speaker A volunteers at a hospital and enjoys making origami crafts, specifically a 3D modular swan with glue.\n6. Speaker B is interested in making origami animals and finds the idea cute.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's fascinating! I never realized origami could have such practical applications in healthcare. It's amazing how versatile this art form can be. I'm really looking forward to learning more about it from you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some useful information, such as Speaker B's interest in making origami animals and Speaker A's willingness to teach origami to Speaker B. However, some of the information seems redundant or contradictory, such as Speaker A successfully making a Lotus flower (point 1) and then expressing interest in trying to make one next (point 4). Additionally, the detail about Speaker A volunteering at a hospital and making a 3D modular swan, while interesting, does not seem directly relevant to the immediate conversational context. Overall, the MEMORY provides some helpful context but lacks coherence and focus to fully support generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
