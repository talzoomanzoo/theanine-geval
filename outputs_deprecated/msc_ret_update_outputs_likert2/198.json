Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college? Speaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position.  Speaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n2. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.\n3. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n4. Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n5. Speaker A is a fan of Arsenal and enjoys watching international teams play.\n6. Speaker B started looking for jobs towards the end of college to secure a job for after graduation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I do miss it sometimes, especially the rush of making a crucial save. But I still enjoy watching games and cheering for my favorite teams. Speaking of which, how's your training going for the upcoming match?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some background information that is somewhat helpful in shaping a response for Speaker B given the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It confirms Speaker B’s past experience with intramural soccer (Sentence 3), which is directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Speaker B mentions playing as a goalkeeper. This could be useful if Speaker B wants to expand on his past experiences in college soccer or share more about his passion for soccer clubs like Manchester United. However, the other sentences in the MEMORY primarily focus on Speaker A’s interests in soccer, which are not directly relevant to producing Speaker B’s next response. Additionally, Sentence 6 about Speaker B's job search is off-topic and unrelated to the context of the conversation. While some helpful elements are present, the MEMORY overall lacks a cohesive connection to the specific soccer discussion at hand."
