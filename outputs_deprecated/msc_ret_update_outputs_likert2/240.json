Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B shared tips on repelling mosquitos using sprays with 20% DEET and other active ingredients.\n2. Speaker B gets scared by bugs and creepy crawlies in the outdoors.\n3. Speaker B dislikes bugs and is not a fan of camping, hiking, or the outdoors.\n4. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n5. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n6. Speaker A enjoys camping trips and looking for wild animals in the woods.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's a smart move! Those bracelets can be really handy, especially if you're going to be out in the woods for a while. I'm glad to hear you're taking precautions to keep those bugs at bay.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information that can assist a language model in generating a response for Speaker B. The memory notes that Speaker B has shared mosquito repellent tips (Sentence 1), which is directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A mentions loading up on repellent. There is a clear causality and relevancy established here between Speaker B's past advice and Speaker A's actions. Although some of the additional sentences, such as Speaker B's fear of bugs (Sentence 2) and dislike of camping (Sentence 3), do not directly support a next response, they add context to Speaker B's perspective and possible responses. Speaker Bâ€™s mixed feelings about the outdoors could influence their response, making the MEMORY more helpful. Sentence 5 about Speaker B enjoying a hike additionally suggests an openness to outdoor activities, which provides depth to their character. Overall, while not every sentence directly supports the next conversational turn, the memory as a whole is relevant and linked coherently to the context."
