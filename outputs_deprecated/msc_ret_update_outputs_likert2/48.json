Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job! Speaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. Speaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?   Speaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n2. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n3. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n4. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B could pay a fee to a ranch to take care of a horse.\n5. Speaker B lives in the city and is interested in having a horse in the future.\n6. Speaker B is concerned about the cost of owning horses, including medical fees and expenses like horse shoes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "It's interesting that you find therapy in riding horses. Horses can be incredibly therapeutic animals. Maybe exploring your love for horses and how it ties into your past could be a valuable avenue to explore in therapy.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains several disjointed pieces of information about both Speaker B and Speaker A, some of which may have potential relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but do not provide a substantial or coherent connection to it. For instance, the MEMORY includes details such as Speaker B's interest in psychology, football, and potentially owning a horse, and Speaker A's knowledge about horses. These details have loose links with the discussion on therapy and personal interests in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as animals being therapeutic or dealing with unresolved issues, but they are not articulated in a way that clearly contributes to generating a proper next response.\n\nMoreover, the MEMORY contains fragmented points that lack causality or relevancy directly tied to the conversation in the context. While they offer background information, they don't clearly demonstrate how these past interactions help in addressing the current topic of discussion, thus limiting their utility in guiding the dialogue further in a meaningful way."
