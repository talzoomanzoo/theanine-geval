Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes.  Speaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me. Speaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house.  Speaker B: Understandable. Have you ever tried contacting animal control? That's how I got Bandicoot. I was working that day and animal control came by explaining about needing fosters for raccoons. I thought it was weird, so I did it and began to work at the small raccoon cafe that is part of the zoo. I love it.  Speaker A: That is a good idea.  Maybe they could help move them to a safer area.  I have a lot of traffic around and they could get hit if they are coming to my place all the time.  Have you been able to teach your raccoon any tricks? Speaker B: The only trick I was able to teach him, that I deeply regret, was how locks worked. I thought it was cool at first, you know, to see a raccoon unlock a door. And now, I regret it so much. I've had to change the layout of my apartment and put deadbolts on my doors so that Bandicoot can't get out. And, he is sneaky about it. One time, he unlocked the pantry and was eating some cookies! It's like having a toddler that never grows up. Speaker A: That is bad I guess.  Do you keep all of your chemicals, poisons, and medications up and locked?  I would hate to think what might happen if Bandicoot got into any of that.  Hey, when you drive do you lock him up in a cage or let him wander around in the car?  That could be dangerous for you driving and he freaks out.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly.\n2. Speaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n3. Bandicoot was a rescue and has been at the Raccoon Cafe since he was a baby.\n4. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n5. Speaker A is worried about the raccoon potentially eating the bearded dragon.\n6. Speaker B owns a raccoon named Bandicoot and a bearded dragon named Bob.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I've made sure to childproof my apartment as much as possible, especially when it comes to dangerous items. I keep all chemicals, poisons, and medications securely locked away in cabinets Bandicoot can't access. As for car rides, I have a designated secure carrier for him. It's definitely safer for both of us that way, especially since Bandicoot can get a little too curious during drives.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's history with raccoons and how Bandicoot, the raccoon, was rescued and taken care of. It also highlights that Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets and has been interested in training the raccoon, which ties into the conversation about animal behavior and the challenges Speaker B faces with Bandicoot. However, some pieces of information are less directly relevant to the current dialogue, such as the mention of the bearded dragon, which is not discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, while MEMORY connects to the situation with Speaker A's raccoon problem, it doesn't provide extensive causal or connected development related to the ongoing conversation. Overall, the memory is somewhat helpful, but some parts could be better connected to the dialogue."
