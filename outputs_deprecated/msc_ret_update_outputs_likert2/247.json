Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately? Speaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me. Speaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway? Speaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day! I'll make it as fun as possible. Speaker B: I will someday. just not in the summer when all the bugs are out! Where do you go hiking the most? Speaker A: I like to go hiking in the local trails here. I am familiar with them and there's so many routes that I can take. Sadly, the bugs are as bad here as they are anywhere else..... Speaker B: They can't be that bad in the fall right? I hope? Do you camp most every weekend?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n2. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n3. Speaker B dislikes bugs and is not a fan of camping, hiking, or the outdoors.\n4. Speaker A enjoys camping trips and looking for wild animals in the woods.\n5. Speaker A leads hikes for the group they camp with, which are usually an hour or two long.\n6. Speaker A is nervous about the Appalachian Trail hike, as they don't usually do full day hikes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I actually try to camp as often as I can during the summer months. It's a great way to disconnect and recharge. Plus, I love looking for wild animals in the woods. But I totally get your aversion to bugs. Maybe we can plan a camping trip for the cooler months when the bugs are less active.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it highlights Speaker B's dislike for bugs and the outdoors, which is relevant since it was mentioned in the conversation. Additionally, both Speaker A's enthusiasm for hiking and leadership in outdoor activities are noted, which aligns with the discussion about Speaker A leading a hike recently.\n\nHowever, there are elements in the MEMORY that do not directly relate to the current context, such as Speaker A's plans for the Appalachian Trail, which has not come up in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the MEMORY could be more cohesive, as the connection between sentences is not always clear. The MEMORY provides partial relevant information but lacks complete and naturally connected sentences that detail past interactions related to the current conversation."
