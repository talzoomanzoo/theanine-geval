Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin! Speaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name?  Speaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls!  Speaker B: I see what you meant. Plus the color is beautiful orange. I want to see them together, even I am not a cat person they must be cute together at that time. Once the kitten grows up, situation gonna change to me. How are they, they are doing well? Speaker A: Marmalade is orange too but this is better because the baby is sassy and climbs up my leg to sit on my shoulder. I don't understand how you are not a cat person when you have such a large heart for stray kittens. Speaker B: hehe you're right. But i can't explain that why I am not a cat person to you sorry. How's the weather like today, still good weather to have iced tea out there? Speaker A: It's beautiful. I'm sitting outside while the Spice Girls are chasing bugs in the grass. What did your kids name your cats?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Marmalade.\n2. Speaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten.\n3. Speaker B is not a cat person but ends up taking care of stray cats brought home by kids.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B have a light-hearted and humorous conversation about their pets and travels.\n5. Speaker A usually leaves their cats with a friend while traveling.\n6. Speaker A is from a city known for great iced teas and prefers unsweetened iced tea.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information that adds context to the conversation, such as Speaker A considering the name Marmalade for a new kitten and Speaker B's relationship with cats, which is discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memory explains Speaker B's non-preference for cats despite taking care of strays, which connects to the dialogue context where Speaker B discusses being impressed by the kittens. The memory also hints at the playful tone of their interactions. However, the memory lacks direct connections or explanations for specific events in the dialog, particularly the final question about Speaker B's kids and cats. Overall, the memory is moderately helpful but lacks detailed relevancy to all points in the dialogue."
