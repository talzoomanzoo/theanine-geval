Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing?

I'll be staying with some of them while I'm over there. I have never been to Greece....I'd like to go though. Maybe I'll add it to my itinerary! Maybe we could plan to be in Greece at the same time?!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology.\n2.

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a fantastic idea! It would be amazing to explore Greece together, especially with our shared interest in Greek mythology. Let's definitely coordinate our travel plans and make it happen. Greece is truly a magical place full of history and mythology waiting to be discovered.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides generally helpful information for generating a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, especially with regards to Speaker B's interests and background. The key points about Speaker B's interest in Greek mythology and the potential trip to Greece are relevant and connected to the current conversation, assisting in guiding future dialogue about travel planning, shared interests, and potential travel alignments with Speaker A. However, there are some points that are off-topic or not useful for steering the current context, such as the specific case study on Poseidon or the suggestion of California as a destination, which do not directly contribute to the progression of the conversation about Italy and Greece travel planning. Despite these less relevant details, the MEMORY sufficiently aids in understanding Speaker B's motivations and preferences, making it quite helpful overall."
