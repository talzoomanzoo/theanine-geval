Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it. Speaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it. Speaker A: Cool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot. What is your favorite part about camping? Speaker B: I love being out in the wilderness and sleeping under the stars in the fresh air. It makes you realize how beautiful life is and how small we really are in comparison to the universe.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat.\n2. Speaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout.\n3. Speaker B is busy with scouts, school, work, and tennis, but willing to take vacation days for the retreat.\n4. Speaker B plans to earn the Eagle Scout badge for college applications.\n5. Speaker B is a member of the boy scouts and works at a fast food place\n6. Speaker A is involved in church activities and mentioned a church retreat\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like such a peaceful experience. Nature has a way of putting things into perspective, doesn't it? It's great to hear how much you enjoy it. You know, our church retreat also focuses on connecting with nature and finding inner peace. You might find it to be a nice complement to your scouting adventures.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides mixed usefulness for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Some pieces of information are helpful, such as Speaker B's involvement with the Boy Scouts and their current status as a Life Scout, as it aligns with the context of discussing the Boy Scouts and camping experiences. This can help Speaker A understand Speaker B's expertise and commitment to scouting activities.\n\nHowever, much of the MEMORY focuses on Speaker B's personal schedule, plans to earn the Eagle Scout badge, their job, and Speaker A's involvement in church activities, which aren't directly relevant or causally linked to the immediate conversation about camping skills and Speaker B's favorite part of camping. These do not necessarily provide details that would enhance the immediate context or naturally flow from the existing dialogue.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY has some relevant and helpful information but also contains portions that don't connect strongly to the development of the dialogic interaction around camping activities and skills."
