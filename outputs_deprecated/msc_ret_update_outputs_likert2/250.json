Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately? Speaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me. Speaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway? Speaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day! I'll make it as fun as possible. Speaker B: I will someday. just not in the summer when all the bugs are out! Where do you go hiking the most? Speaker A: I like to go hiking in the local trails here. I am familiar with them and there's so many routes that I can take. Sadly, the bugs are as bad here as they are anywhere else..... Speaker B: They can't be that bad in the fall right? I hope? Do you camp most every weekend? Speaker A: A least a couple of times a month. Sometimes, yeah, I go every weekend to relax. Being in nature is so relaxing to me. And nah the bugs aren't too bad in the fall and winter. There's a beautiful river along one trail that I bet you'd love to see.  Speaker B: That sounds like it would be relaxing. I would probable be okay if we didn't run into any wolves, bears etc. Have you ever came across any predators when you were camping? Speaker A: Oh I've seen bears and even a mountain lion. Luckily, it was a far away encounter and they didn't know that we were there. As soon as I saw them we changed directions fairly quickly but quietly. Don't worry, I've only seen it a handful of times in my time camping.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys camping trips and looking for wild animals in the woods.\n2. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n3. Speaker A is comfortable around animals in the woods but admits a bear would make them jumpy.\n4. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n5. Speaker A enjoys hiking, birdwatching, and spotting rare animals.\n6. Speaker B dislikes bugs and is not a fan of camping, hiking, or the outdoors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's quite the wildlife encounter! I'm glad you knew what to do in those situations. I definitely would have been on edge if I saw a bear or mountain lion. It must have been an adrenaline rush!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information to the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, points 1, 3, and 6 relate to the themes discussed, such as camping, hiking, and encountering wild animals. These points could help in generating responses about Speaker A's comfort with animals or Speaker B's hesitance due to bugs. However, some memories like point 2 (Speaker B going on a long hike) and 4 (Speaker A's plans for the Appalachian Trail) are neither mentioned nor suggested in the dialogue, making them somewhat disconnected. The MEMORY highlights general interests and tendencies but lacks specific connections or continuity with the current context. More detailed memories directly relevant to the conversation's progression would enhance its helpfulness."
