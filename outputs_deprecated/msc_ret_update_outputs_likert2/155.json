Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it! Speaker B: I'm glad you liked it. My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's husband enjoys Disney sports movies, such as 'Miracle'.\n2. Speaker B's kids enjoy watching Disney movies, which Speaker B also finds good.\n3. Speaker B recommends Speaker A to watch 'Miracle'.\n4. Speaker B's kids enjoyed watching 'Luca' and said it was good.\n5. Speaker B enjoys watching movies with her kids.\n6. Speaker A also enjoys watching sports movies on Disney.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY contains several points relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, especially concerning Speaker B's liking for Disney movies and the recommendation of the movie 'Miracle'. These are helpful for Speaker A to continue the conversation about movies. However, the connections between these points could be stronger.\n\n1. Key points like Speaker B's husband and kids enjoying Disney movies are relevant but fragmented. \n2. The history of recommending 'Miracle' and the enjoyment by Speaker A’s family directly ties into the context, but its connection with other memories isn’t clear.\n3. The mention of 'Luca' and general enjoyment of Disney movies can facilitate further discussion, but aren't directly linked to the dialogue or driving a clear narrative.\n4. The fact that Speaker A enjoys Disney sports movies like 'Miracle' could be included more seamlessly for better coherence and engagement in dialogue extension.\n\nOverall, the memory helps provide context and facilitate conversation but lacks fluid connection and causality throughout the points."
