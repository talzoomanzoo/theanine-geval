    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing? Speaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from? Speaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there. Speaker B: That's great. I have gotten my pets from the shelter and they seem happy I brought them home. I have a hard time saying no to them which is why I have so many pets. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs. Do you have a name in mind for your cat?  Speaker A: I've thought of a lot of  names, but in the end it will probably depend on the breed and the sex.   Speaker B: That's true. Is pilates hard? I've always wanted to try it but I don't know if it will be too difficult. Speaker A: No, I don't think it's hard.  I actually enjoy it.  It's more fun than work, at least to me. You should give it a try! Speaker B: Maybe I will. Do you think I can start at home by watching Youtube videos, or do I need to go to a Pilates class?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions.\n2. Both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy the company of their pets and think they are smart and playful.\n3. Speaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals, discovered love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets.\n4. Speaker A reads a novel a week, lives in the city, and goes to pilates class.\n5. Speaker A is interested in getting a dog and likes Akitas.\n6. Speaker B thinks pit bulls are lovely and has one that is kind and sweet.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Starting with Youtube videos at home is a great idea to get a feel for Pilates! It's a good way to see if you enjoy the exercises before committing to a class. Plus, you might even be able to involve your pets in the workout somehow, knowing how creative you are with them!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information that could aid Speaker A in generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, the fact that Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions (Memory 1) aligns with the ongoing conversation about pets and their personalities. Additionally, the detail that Speaker A goes to pilates class (Memory 4) links to the recent topics in the context. However, the MEMORY also includes several pieces of information that are not directly useful for the current conversation (e.g., Memory 3 and Memory 5 about painting and liking Akitas respectively). These details are somewhat relevant to their broader discussion about pets and hobbies but are not clearly connected or causally related to the specifics of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, MEMORY has some pertinence but lacks strong interconnectedness and focus."
