Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on! Speaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar. Speaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general? Speaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts. Speaker A: How's learning to bake going in general, especially now that you're off desserts? Speaker B: I one of those people how have to fail a couple of times before I get the hang of it, but I'm getting there.  Have you and the kids had any chance to go skiing lately? Speaker A: Water skiing? Yes, last weekend. It was so much fun! Speaker B: (sorry my typing sucks)  That's awesome. I wish had access to a boat, but who knows, maybe one day.  Speaker A: Boating is so fun. You could go wakeboarding more often if you had your own boat. And no more boat rental fees or hassle. Speaker B: I actually saw a drone the at will pull you in the water. It's the craziest thing.   Speaker A: That must be a huge drone!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is excited to join Speaker A's family for a water skiing trip and wants to learn from Speaker A's kids.\n2. Speaker A loves boating and water sports, mentioning that they are better at water skiing than wakeboarding.\n3. Speaker B expresses interest in trying water skiing next.\n4. Speaker A has been water skiing for 15 years and has 3 kids who also water ski.\n5. Speaker B enjoys snowboarding but will focus on wakeboarding as summer approaches.\n6. Speaker A takes their boat out every day and wishes they had a houseboat.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, those drones for water sports are pretty cool. They can make wakeboarding or water skiing more accessible without needing a boat. Maybe that could be a fun alternative for you to try out!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that could assist in generating a proper response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, it requires some points to clearly connect with the conversation. \n\n1. Memory Point #1: Speaker B's excitement to join for a water skiing trip ties into the previous dialogue where Speaker B expresses interest in boating and water sports.\n2. Memory Point #3: Speaker B's interest in trying water skiing is coherent with their interest in watersports, as mentioned in the context about wishing they had access to a boat.\n3. Memory Point #5: Speaker B focusing on wakeboarding aligns with their previous expression of interest in boating-related activities.\n\nThe lack of connection between some memory points with the context (like snowboarding, or wishing for a houseboat which is mentioned) could be more connected to the context. Thus, while some parts are relevant, the full potential of connections between dialogue context and memory points could be further enhanced."
