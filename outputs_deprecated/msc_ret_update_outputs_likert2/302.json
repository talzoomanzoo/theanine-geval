Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some insights into Speaker A's preferences and interests (such as enjoying Brazilian food and salsa dancing), but it does not directly enhance the ability to generate a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY does not effectively connect back to the ongoing conversation about specific foods, movies, or healing methods. There is some relevant information that could potentially be linked, like Speaker B's interest in healing, but itâ€™s not clearly developed or naturally connected in a way that demonstrates relevance or causality to the current dialogue. The presence of non-sequitur information, like A's love for water or salsa dancing, further reduces its immediate helpfulness."
