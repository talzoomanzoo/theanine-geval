Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies! Speaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?   Speaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere! Speaker B: You have a point.  It is nice to see puppies wagging their tail and just following you!  Changing topics, do you have any recipes with asparagus?  You know, it's such a popular vegetable, but I just don't know how to prepare it. Speaker A: I don't have recipes but I know how to make a good grilled asparagus. Are you looking to bolster your chef book? Speaker B: I sure am!  Grilled asparagus does sound good.  Do you pair the grilled asparagus with your fajitas?  What do you prefer, chicken or beef fajitas?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys cooking, especially making fajitas, and also volunteers at animal shelters.\n2. Speaker A enjoys grilling indoors and suggests grilled asparagus with lemon on it.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B are excited about the idea of traveling the world and trying different cuisines.\n4. Speaker A mainly cares for dogs at the animal shelter, but also cats, and loves when new puppies are brought in.\n5. Speaker B is interested in volunteering and prefers cats over dogs, especially kittens.\n6. Speaker A is more interested in science than music, while Speaker B enjoys listening to Black Sabbath and grilling meat.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I usually pair the grilled asparagus with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice on top for a zesty flavor. As for fajitas, I'm more of a chicken fajitas person myself. The combination of tender chicken with saut√©ed peppers and onions always hits the spot for me. How about you, do you lean towards chicken or beef fajitas?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY offers a rich background that provides contextually relevant information for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes Speaker A's volunteer work at animal shelters (related to the discussion about cats and puppies), their cooking preferences such as making fajitas and grilling asparagus (relevant to the query about asparagus dishes). The MEMORY shows natural connections, such as Speaker B's interest in grilling meat and gardening, while also noting personal tastes like their preference for music and pets, which may be useful for broadening future dialogue topics. Despite its helpfulness, there could be more direct ties or cause-and-effect scenarios from past interactions that pertain specifically to the ongoing discussion, thus the score is not a 5."
