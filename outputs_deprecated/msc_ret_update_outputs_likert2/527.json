Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer? Speaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to? Speaker A: The museum has all sorts of galleries.  It has a sculpture garden outside.  I mostly like the impressionist paintings.  I like Van Gogh.  Was your concert outdoors? Speaker B: Yes. That way they could have a fireworks show too. I love fireworks. Have you ever seen the fireworks at the Disney castle? Speaker A: No, but I have been to Disney World in Florida.  I love fireworks too.  I want to get married on the 4th of July.  That was we will have a national holiday and fireworks for us every year!  It sounds like you've been to Disneyland? Speaker B: No, but I thought you might have since you lived in LA for awhile. Did you get to see any live Disney music performances while you were at Disney World? Speaker A: No, we rode a lot of rides that broke down.  We had to be rescued from the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.  It was stuck.  Someone put on waders and pushed us to the side to climb out. Speaker B: Oh no! Hopefully your trip to the art museum is much better than that. Did your boyfriend go to Disney World too? Speaker A: No, I had a cousin that I went with.  We stayed in a hotel in Miami too and I got so sunburned on the beach!  I'm sure the art museum will be good if it isn't too crowded.  Was your concert crowded?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A loves Disney music.\n2. Speaker A enjoys going to museums and trying different foods.\n3. Speaker A is planning to visit the Museum of Art of São Paulo next week with their boyfriend.\n4. Speaker A is interested in music concerts and planning a trip to Sao Paulo.\n5. Speaker A and their boyfriend also look forward to having some refreshing beers by the beach.\n6. Speaker B is waiting for bands to announce their summer tour schedule to plan which shows to attend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "The concert wasn't too crowded actually. It was just the right amount of people to enjoy the music and the fireworks. Hopefully, the art museum won't be too crowded either. It sounds like you had quite the adventure at Disney World and Miami with your cousin!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information that can be useful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it mentions Speaker A's interest in museums and music concerts, which aligns with the current topics of conversation in the dialogue. However, the specifics in MEMORY about the Museum of Art of São Paulo and travels with the boyfriend are not directly relevant to the current context, where the conversation focuses more on past visits to Disney World and recent concert experiences. The mention of waiting for summer tour schedules by Speaker B is tangentially relevant since concerts have been discussed. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it included information specifically linking these past preferences or activities to the current conversation, such as mentioning fireworks or past Disney experiences. Overall, MEMORY provides some useful insights but lacks a stronger connection to the current dialogue."
