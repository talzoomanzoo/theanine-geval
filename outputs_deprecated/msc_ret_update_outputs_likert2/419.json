Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin! Speaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name?  Speaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls!  Speaker B: I see what you meant. Plus the color is beautiful orange. I want to see them together, even I am not a cat person they must be cute together at that time. Once the kitten grows up, situation gonna change to me. How are they, they are doing well? Speaker A: Marmalade is orange too but this is better because the baby is sassy and climbs up my leg to sit on my shoulder. I don't understand how you are not a cat person when you have such a large heart for stray kittens. Speaker B: hehe you're right. But i can't explain that why I am not a cat person to you sorry. How's the weather like today, still good weather to have iced tea out there? Speaker A: It's beautiful. I'm sitting outside while the Spice Girls are chasing bugs in the grass. What did your kids name your cats? Speaker B: ohh so nice sounds like you are enjoying the weather. Still we are discussing about that. Did not name them yet. Also I want to put them back since I am not a big fan of cat\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Marmalade.\n2. Speaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten.\n3. Speaker B is not a cat person but ends up taking care of stray cats brought home by kids.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B have a light-hearted and humorous conversation about their pets and travels.\n5. Speaker A usually leaves their cats with a friend while traveling.\n6. Speaker A is from a city known for great iced teas and prefers unsweetened iced tea.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Maybe your kids will come up with some creative names for the cats! Who knows, they might end up naming them after famous iced teas from my city!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The details about Speaker A's cat and the potential names for the kitten, like Ginger and Marmalade, directly connect to the conversation about cats and naming. It also mentions that Speaker B is not a cat person, which is relevant as Speaker B expresses confusion about not being a cat person in the dialogue. However, the MEMORY could be improved by mentioning Speaker A's preference for \"Pumpkin,\" as it is the chosen name in the dialogue. Other parts of the MEMORY, like Speaker A's travels or their car, are less relevant to the conversation at hand, which is predominantly focused on cats and weather. Additionally, the causal connection between the events in the MEMORY could be more explicitly articulated to achieve a higher score."
