Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice.  Speaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with? Speaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think? Speaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work.\n2. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker.\n3. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n4. Speaker A recommends the pressure cooker for its efficiency and ease of use, suggesting it to Speaker B.\n5. Speaker A has given a pressure cooker as a gift and uses it for recipes like lamb shanks.\n6. Speaker B's husband is a great cook and Speaker B is not skilled in cooking.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, shrimp fried rice typically includes eggs, so it's a fantastic recipe to incorporate your homegrown eggs. It's a delicious and satisfying dish that's relatively easy to make in a pressure cooker. Let me know if you need any tips or guidance when you're ready to give it a try!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe memory provides helpful insights relevant to the dialogue context, particularly regarding Speaker B's interest in cooking and Speaker A's knowledge of and recommendation for using a pressure cooker. These details help build a basis for why Speaker A would suggest shrimp fried rice as a starting recipe, given the context of easy cooking with the pressure cooker. There is some repetition, as points 1 and 6 both mention Speaker B's husband's cooking skills, although the connection and causality between Speaker B learning to cook and her husband's interest are clear. The memory could be even more helpful if it further elaborated on Speaker B's specific goals or constraints related to cooking. Overall, the memory supports a well-contextualized response generation by representing the development of past interactions between the speakers and their interests."
