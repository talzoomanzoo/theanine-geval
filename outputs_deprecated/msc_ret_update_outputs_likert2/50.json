Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job! Speaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. Speaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?   Speaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone. Speaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you? Speaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n2. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n3. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n4. Speaker B lives in the city and is interested in having a horse in the future.\n5. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n6. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B could pay a fee to a ranch to take care of a horse.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Therapy is definitely a process that can have a completion point, especially when specific goals or issues have been addressed and resolved. It's all about working towards personal growth and healing. And remember, just like riding horses, therapy can also be a form of self-care and support.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but there is a lack of explicit connections or causality that would make it more helpful. Hereâ€™s why it received a score of 3:\n\n1. Relevant Information: MEMORY points 1, 2, 3, and 5 are somewhat related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Memory point 2 is specifically helpful, as it confirms Speaker B is a therapist, which aligns with the context of their conversation. Memory point 3 aligns with Speaker A's comments about their limited psychology knowledge. Memory point 5 gives background on Speaker B's experience and how they currently run their practice, linking to their conversation about therapy.\n\n2. Limited Causality and Relevance: The MEMORY does not explicitly connect these elements to current dialogues or provide foreseeable topics that could be immediately helpful for producing a continued response. \n\nOverall, while there are some relevant details, the memory lacks a more cohesive narrative or explicit causal connections to the current dialogue. This impacts the helpfulness, resulting in a mid-range score."
