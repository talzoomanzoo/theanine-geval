Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet?  Speaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name? Speaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended.  Speaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along! Speaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them. Speaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n2. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n3. Speaker A is interested in training tips for the kittens and is open to adopting one despite having a parrot.\n4. Speaker A suggested the name Zhao for one of the kittens.\n5. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n6. Speaker A's parrot Tasha has seen cats before and ignores them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains helpful information, but also has some points that don't contribute directly to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n1. MEMORY items 1 and 2 are directly relevant as they reflect Speaker A's intent to adopt a rescue kitten and their existing pet, Tasha the parrot, and link well with the context.\n2. MEMORY item 6 complements the context by providing additional info about Tasha's previous interactions with cats, which could be helpful for future responses about adopting kittens.\n3. MEMORY items 3 and 4 provide additional context about Speaker A’s openness to kitten adoption and name suggestions which could be valuable in a broader dialogue but aren’t directly tied to the current context-specific conversation about adoption or the parrot-cat dynamic.\n4. MEMORY item 5, about Speaker B’s paperwork and Mandarin names considerations, offers a nice background detail but isn’t directly linked to what’s happening in the current dialogue. \n\nOverall, while some transition smoothly into the context, others seem disjointed or less consequential to the immediate scene presented, making them not as helpful for generating a direct response."
