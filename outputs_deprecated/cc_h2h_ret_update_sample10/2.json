    "prediction": "Explanation: Both responses express agreement with the parent's sentiments about the value of listening during tough times. However, Response 2 adds an additional layer by mentioning the reciprocal support the child feels for the parent, which emphasizes the ongoing relationship built on listening and understanding. This aligns closely with the context of being a good listener and fostering support during difficult moments. Therefore, Response 2 is more consistent with the theme of mutual support and the importance of listening ingrained in the past memory of parental interaction. \n\nChoice: 2"
