Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue.\nSpeaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad.\nSpeaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is in the process of renovating their house to meet their living standards with their pets. Speaker A suggests ways to incorporate the purple sofas into the existing light green paint in the room, leading Speaker B to regret their green and purple color scheme and be willing to give away their purple furniture. \nSpeaker B is looking for furniture shop to buy furniture, has two dogs, and works near a mall. Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing furniture and home decor choices, which causes them to plan to meet up to discuss the furniture exchange. Speaker A, who has devices to keep bugs away, offers to share the product names with Speaker B, who wants to bring bug spray for their barbecue meeting. \nSpeaker A and Speaker B both enjoy barbecuing and have a love for pets. They acknowledge their lack of expertise in interior decorating, which leads them to plan to meet up to discuss the furniture exchange. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "I had considered a gray and navy color scheme as well. Your lamp sounds like it will be really helpful to keep the bugs away during our barbecue.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for Speaker B to generate a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It indicates that Speaker B is in the process of renovating their home and engaging with Speaker A on furniture and decor choices, which aligns with the ongoing dialogue about color schemes and bug solutions. The MEMORY ties in past interactions, such as mistakes made in a previous color scheme and plans for a furniture exchange, which are pertinent for further discussion in the dialogue. Additionally, there is mention of a shared interest in barbecuing and dealing with insects, which supports the context of their upcoming barbecue meet-up. Although some details are not directly needed to generate the next response (e.g., Speaker B having two dogs or working near a mall), these are naturally phrased and do not disrupt the overall flow and relevancy of the MEMORY. Overall, the MEMORY successfully provides contextual cues that develop the speakers' past interactions and are supportive of the current dialogue."
