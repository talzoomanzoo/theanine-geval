Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer?\nSpeaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to?\nSpeaker A: The museum has all sorts of galleries.  It has a sculpture garden outside.  I mostly like the impressionist paintings.  I like Van Gogh.  Was your concert outdoors?\nSpeaker B: Yes. That way they could have a fireworks show too. I love fireworks. Have you ever seen the fireworks at the Disney castle?\nSpeaker A: No, but I have been to Disney World in Florida.  I love fireworks too.  I want to get married on the 4th of July.  That was we will have a national holiday and fireworks for us every year!  It sounds like you've been to Disneyland?\nSpeaker B: No, but I thought you might have since you lived in LA for awhile. Did you get to see any live Disney music performances while you were at Disney World?\nSpeaker A: No, we rode a lot of rides that broke down.  We had to be rescued from the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.  It was stuck.  Someone put on waders and pushed us to the side to climb out.\nSpeaker B: Oh no! Hopefully your trip to the art museum is much better than that. Did your boyfriend go to Disney World too?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys living in the city for the accessibility to food, live music, and museums. This is why Speaker A is planning to visit the Museum of Art of São Paulo next week with their boyfriend. \nSpeaker B enjoys living in the city for the accessibility to food, live music, and museums.

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, my boyfriend came with me to Disney World. He loved the roller coasters, but not so much the long lines.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains some information that could be potentially helpful but in a very limited capacity. The mention that Speaker B enjoys live music connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Speaker B talks about attending concerts and having fireworks. However, the connection is not developed clearly, as the MEMORY repeats itself with little added relevance to the context. Also, the mention of Speaker A planning a visit to the Museum of Art of São Paulo does not contribute to the current dialogue, which discusses other aspects of art museums and Disney experiences. The last sentence of MEMORY about waiting for Disney music tours is somewhat relevant but lacks structure and context to be clearly helpful. Overall, the MEMORY does not provide a strong, coherent cue for generating the next response, leading to a low helpfulness score."
