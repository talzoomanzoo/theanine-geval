Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her?\nSpeaker B: Hi there, hope you are wlll and managing to save up for your Italy trip?  Thank for asking about the Greek mythology study, we are doing very well. It helps because i am so passionate about it and hope to get to the Greek islands soon\nSpeaker A: Yes I have been saving up for another trip to Italy! I can't wait. It's planned for next Spring. Do you have any plans to go back to Italy in the future?\nSpeaker B: I would love to get back to Italy but need to save up and the hopeful priority is to Greece this year.  You have friends in Europe are you in contact to see what plans you can make?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has expressed interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology. Speaker A is planning to travel to Italy alone for Spring Break and has friends from Europe meeting up with them. Speaker B has tried surfing before but is not very good at it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I've been in touch with my friends in Europe. We're working on coordinating our schedules for when I visit. It should be a great time!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some helpful information regarding Speaker B's interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B mentions wanting to visit the Greek islands. It also mentions Speaker A's travel plans to Italy and their contacts in Europe, which is relevant as Speaker A discusses saving up and planning a trip to Italy. However, the part about Speaker B trying surfing is not relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and doesn't help in generating the next response. The sentences are fairly structured, but the memory could be improved by excluding irrelevant information and better connecting all relevant details to the dialogue context to increase its helpfulness score."
