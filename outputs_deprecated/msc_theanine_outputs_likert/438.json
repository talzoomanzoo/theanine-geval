Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\nSpeaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it.\nSpeaker A: Cool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot. What is your favorite part about camping?\nSpeaker B: I love being out in the wilderness and sleeping under the stars in the fresh air. It makes you realize how beautiful life is and how small we really are in comparison to the universe.\nSpeaker A: I miss doing that! I have done lots of picnics with my family but it's been a long time since I've slept in a tent! Looking forward to it again when the kids are older. Where was the last place you went?\nSpeaker B: We went up to an island in the middle of nowhere in Canada. There were lots of bears and huge moose!\nSpeaker A: Wow, that sounds like such an adventure! I love to visit Canada. I have seen moose but never a bear! That must have been scary!\nSpeaker B: Yes, it is quite scary. We could also hear the wolves howling at night, luckily we didn't come across them though. One thing to note about bears, is they just want to come and scrounge for our food, so we learned to safely pack it away and hang it up high in a tree.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is actively involved in tennis and church activities, which leads them to suggest that Speaker B join a church retreat in the future. Speaker B, who has been dedicated to Boy Scouts for several years and is currently a Life Scout, is invited by Speaker A to participate in a youth retreat. Speaker B, aspiring to become an Eagle Scout, is interested in joining the church retreat suggested by Speaker A. Despite feeling lonely as a stay-at-home mom, Speaker B is considering using their saved vacation days to participate in the retreat, balancing their busy schedule involving scouts, school, work, and tennis.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That must have been an unforgettable experience with all those wild animals around! Safety is always a top priority when camping.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context that can be useful for the dialogue. It illustrates Speaker B's involvement with Boy Scouts, which aligns with the discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about survival skills and camping. Additionally, it shows Speaker B's aspiration to become an Eagle Scout, which further solidifies their expertise in scouting and camping activities, relevant to the conversation about outdoor adventures. However, the MEMORY also includes information about a church retreat and Speaker B's personal circumstances, like being a stay-at-home mom and managing a busy schedule, which are not directly relevant to the current dialogue about camping and survival skills. While this additional information provides background context about Speaker B, it does not contribute directly to the generation of the next immediate response in the current dialogue. The MEMORY's helpfulness would be higher if more focus was placed on the relevant aspects of scouting and camping experience that are more directly tied to the conversation."
