Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens?\nSpeaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month\nSpeaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.  Where are you going on vacation?\nSpeaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there!\nSpeaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and has a preference for seeing pandas and penguins, as well as exotic birds. They have been to the zoo before and go with their sister. On the other hand, Speaker A prefers cockatoos over kittens as pets.\n\nSpeaker A and Speaker B discuss their hobbies and interests, with Speaker A enjoying gardening and reading, while Speaker B enjoys visiting the zoo. Speaker B's girlfriend shares the same enjoyment of pandas and penguins at the zoo, and they visit the zoo every few weeks. Additionally, Speaker A's sister is a dog person with a yellow lab. Speaker B is willing to be a cool uncle to his sister's future children but does not want kids of his own.\n\nSpeaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and also loves visiting the zoo. Speaker A, on the other hand, enjoys seeing pandas, penguins, and exotic birds at the zoo and usually goes with their sister. Furthermore, Speaker A expresses a preference for cockatoos over kittens as pets.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've been to the San Diego Zoo a couple of times before, it's really impressive with a wide variety of animals.",
    "prediction": "3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information that could potentially be helpful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the content is not very well-connected to the context, which makes it moderately helpful.\n\n1. The MEMORY mentions Speaker A's enjoyment of the zoo and preference for seeing pandas, penguins, and exotic birds, which aligns with Speaker B's mention of visiting the zoo in San Diego. This connection can be considered helpful in furthering the conversation about Speaker B's vacation plans and zoo visit.\n\n2. The MEMORY references Speaker B’s similar enjoyment of visiting the zoo and their girlfriend's same interests, which relate to the context where Speaker B mentions their excitement about visiting the zoo. This part is somewhat relevant.\n\n3. The discussions about pets (preferences for cockatoos and kittens) and hobbies are not directly related to the current conversation about the vacation and zoo visit. These parts are less helpful for generating the next response and do not enhance the understanding of immediate dialogue context.\n\nOverall, while the MEMORY includes some relevant aspects aligning with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, the lack of clear connection and relevance to Speaker B’s vacation makes it moderately helpful. More concise and directly relevant memory would score higher."
