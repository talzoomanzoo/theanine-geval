Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B's mom is a nurse and busy with work, which led Speaker B to become a therapist, mentioning the ups and downs of the profession. Speaker B is concerned about the cost of owning horses, including medical fees and expenses like horse shoes, and is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n\nSpeaker A is involved in horse breeding and taking care of horses, working at a stable and enjoying being around horses. Speaker A mentions that horses often hurt themselves while exercising, leading to potential medical costs.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I do still enjoy being a therapist, but it definitely has its challenges. It's rewarding to help people navigate through their struggles.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some relevant context for generating a next response, primarily related to Speaker B's motivations and experiences as a therapist, which connects back to the question about deciding to become a therapist in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, a significant portion of the MEMORY is focused on the topic of horses, which is not directly relevant to the current conversation about therapy. While Speaker B's mention of \"ups and downs of the profession\" and the connection to their mom being a nurse is helpful, the inclusion of details about horse ownership and Freudian theories seems tangential and doesn't directly contribute to the development of the dialogue context focused on therapy. The MEMORY could be more useful if it concentrated more on Speaker B's experiences and feelings related to being a therapist and less on the unrelated details about horses. Overall, the MEMORY does provide some relevant context but lacks a strong focus or integration with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, leading to a moderate helpfulness score."
