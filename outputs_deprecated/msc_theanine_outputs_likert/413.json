Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin!\nSpeaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name? \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is excited for the trip and looking forward to trying the best iced tea.\nSpeaker A has a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Pumpkin.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "I thought Pumpkin was a better fit for the new kitten's personality.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The last part of the memory explicitly references a kitten and the name \"Pumpkin,\" which is directly related to the dialogue where Speaker A discusses naming a kitten \"Pumpkin.\" This offers context for why Speaker A might change the kitten's name from \"Marmalade\" to \"Pumpkin.\" \n\nHowever, the part of MEMORY mentioning that Speaker B is excited for a trip and looking forward to trying iced tea is not relevant to the current dialogue context about the kitten's name. This memory, although naturally structured and clear, does not contribute to the ongoing conversation about the kitten's name.\n\nOverall, while not all of the MEMORY is related to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, it does provide relevant background information regarding the decision about the kitten's name, which can help the language model generate a proper response."
