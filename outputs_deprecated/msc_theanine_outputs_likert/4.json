Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break, and is going on a trip to Costa Rica for 2 weeks. \nSpeaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one. \nSpeaker B dyed their hair with henna and enjoys experimenting with different hair colors, planning to touch up their hair for the summer due to sun and pool damage.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds fascinating! Learning about history can be so enriching. Do you have any other historical fiction recommendations?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information about Speaker B's upcoming trip to Costa Rica, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B discusses their travel plans. This helps maintain continuity and provides context for the current conversation. However, the remaining details in the MEMORY about Speaker B's excitement for Easter weekend, spring break, hair dyeing, and Speaker A's past spring breaks do not directly contribute to the current dialogue context. These additional details, while naturally phrased, are not immediately helpful for generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as they don't relate to the mention of books and historical interests raised by Speaker A. Hence, while some relevant information is present, the MEMORY could be improved by including more directly pertinent details or connections to the ongoing conversation, which would result in a higher score."
