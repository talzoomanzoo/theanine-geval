Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\nSpeaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call!\nSpeaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip? \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is a librarian and loves kids, mentioning having 3 children. This makes Speaker A busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. Consequently, Speaker B, who has a lot of kids all grown up with kids of their own, enjoys spending time with their grandkids at the park. This led Speaker B to take their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've been thinking about it, and I believe it could be a wonderful tradition for all of us. The kids seemed to enjoy it, and it's a great way to bond with nature.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a good amount of helpful information for generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It conveys relevant details about the relationship and past interactions between Speaker A and Speaker B. The MEMORY highlights that Speaker A is busy with work and has difficulty finding time for family, which aligns with their comment about needing technology to keep in touch. Additionally, the MEMORY provides context for Speaker B's interest in spending time with their grandkids, which ties into their suggestion of an annual fishing trip, a topic mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY shows a clear development in Speaker B's relationship with their grandkids, connecting their past fishing experience to the idea of making it an annual event. This information is structured in a way that naturally informs the conversation and response generation. Although the MEMORY is missing some specific dialogue references or connections, it still provides significant context that the language model can use to craft a meaningful response."
