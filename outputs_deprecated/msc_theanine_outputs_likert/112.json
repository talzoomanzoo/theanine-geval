    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok? \nSpeaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish?\nSpeaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys working at the restaurant due to the interaction with people and the variety of experiences it brings. This includes getting two free meals per week and taking home leftover baked goods. Speaker A also owns a restaurant and recently dealt with a fire incident, but managed to put it out. Despite the busy schedule, Speaker A finds joy in working there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about Speaker A working at a restaurant, which is partially relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A is excited about a dish being added to the menu at their workplace. The MEMORY mentions Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant, which relates to the positive tone of Speaker A in the dialogue. However, the MEMORY also includes additional information about Speaker A owning another restaurant and a recent fire incident, which are not directly relevant to the current conversation about the Chicken parmesan dish. The connection between MEMORY and DIALOGUE CONTEXT could be clearer, and while the MEMORY offers some helpful context, much of it may not directly aid generating a specific response to the current dialogue about the new dish. The sentences are structured in a way that tells us about Speaker A's past interactions with their workplace, providing some useful background information but not directly enhancing the continuation of this specific conversation."
