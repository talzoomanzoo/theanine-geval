Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is involved in horse breeding and taking care of horses, which has caused Speaker B to work in their own therapy practice for about six years. \nSpeaker B, a therapist and football fan supporting the Chiefs, mentions the ups and downs of the profession, and wants to live in the city and have a horse in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've always been interested in helping others and psychology, so becoming a therapist felt like a natural fit for me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: While the MEMORY provides some background information about Speaker B’s profession and interests, it does not effectively support the generation of a response to Speaker A's specific question about becoming a therapist. The MEMORY includes details about horse breeding and Speaker B’s future aspirations, but these do not directly relate to the context of how Speaker B decided to pursue a career in therapy. There is an indirect connection through Speaker A’s involvement with horses possibly influencing Speaker B’s living arrangements, but this is not sufficient to provide a clear causal understanding or relevant context for the question asked in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The information about being a football fan also lacks relevancy and connection to past interactions regarding therapy. Thus, the MEMORY does not offer helpful, naturally connected cues for developing a dialogue response."
