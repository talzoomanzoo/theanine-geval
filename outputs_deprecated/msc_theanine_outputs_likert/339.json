    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it! Thank you for the recommendation.\nSpeaker B: Of course. I recommend that movie to everyone I meet. I think I've watched it over one hundred times. So what is the next movie on your list to watch soon?\nSpeaker A: Yeah it was great and I will also recommend to people when they ask what movie is good. So next is another one you recommended which is coming to America. What’s the next movie your going to watch? \nSpeaker B: There is a horror genre movie that was released just this week which I'm going to watch tonight. It is called \"Girl Next.\"\nSpeaker A: Oh that sounds interesting, I will look into that and put it on my list. How has your job been going? Is there where you get all these great ideas for what to watch?  \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys watching a variety of movie genres with their kids, including suspense films, action, SF, horror, westerns, drama, and occasional good comedy. This influences Speaker B to provide recommendations to Speaker A based on their preferences, such as mentioning Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "My job has been going well, thank you for asking. I do get some recommendations from work, but mostly I just enjoy exploring different genres on my own.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information about Speaker B's broad interests in movie genres. This context can assist in tailoring responses or recommendations based on potential shared interests. However, this MEMORY does not strongly connect or develop past interactions specifically related to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The mention of recommending \"Pulp Fiction\" aligns with the dialogue, yet it lacks detailed connections or causality to the specific conversation about watching \"Girl Next\" or thoughts on current job influences in movie choices. While the memory is well-structured, it misses precise contextual cues for the ongoing dialogue, perhaps impacting the potential for a more dynamic interaction."
