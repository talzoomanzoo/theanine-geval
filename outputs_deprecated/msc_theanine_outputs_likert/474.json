    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it?\nSpeaker B: Yes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see. \nSpeaker A: I definitely will, this sounds like such an amazing trip. How long has it been since you've been there yourself?\nSpeaker B: I was in Greece last two years ago.   I am excited to go again soon!    At somepoint I would like to take a cruise around the islands there.  It seems like a neat way to see all the Islands in an easy way.   Have you ever taken a cruise?\nSpeaker A: Only once before when I was very young, so I don't remember much. It sounds like such a relaxing way to enjoy the day, though. Maybe we can plan a cruise together sometime.\nSpeaker B: That would be fun!  I go to Europe a lot so maybe a cruise in the Caribbean would be nice.  I would like to see Saint Lucia and Saint Thomas. \nSpeaker A: Oh, Europe? I'm already sold on the idea, sounds like a blast! I've never had a negative experience in Europe. Should we visit some of the capital cities?\nSpeaker B: I would like to go to Paris.  Since I live in Amsterdam I could take the train down.  I have seen much and Italy and Greece but would love to go to Paris.  Have you been there before? \nSpeaker A: Only once, and I had a really great time there. The buildings were so beautiful and the food was delicious. Do you like French food?\nSpeaker B: I do like French food- but it is very rich.  I especially love French desserts like macarons.   I would like to see the museums in Paris. \nSpeaker A: That's a good idea! I definitely haven't seen enough of them. Should we bring anyone else along on our trip?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A's mother being a pediatrician causes Speaker A to have kids and be familiar with Greek mythology. This leads to Speaker B and their kids being excited about their upcoming trip to Greece. \nSpeaker B enjoying being outside and reading Star Wars novels is the same topic as Speaker B being excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loving Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian. This leads to Speaker B planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five, recommending visiting the Parthenon, Acropolis of Athens, and the beach on Corfu Island in Greece. \nSpeaker B wanting to bring three kids causes Speaker A to have kids and be familiar with Greek mythology. This makes Speaker A want to travel around Europe, visiting capital cities of each country, and react by booking a plane ticket to Rome on a whim, leaving in two weeks.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "We could invite some friends or family to join us on our European adventure. The more, the merrier!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains some information that could be related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's interest in visiting Greece and recommending certain places like the Parthenon and Acropolis of Athens. However, the connections between the statements in MEMORY and their relevance to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT are not clearly articulated, making it challenging for the language model to utilize this information effectively for generating a proper next response. The sentences in MEMORY are not naturally structured and tangled with unrelated details (e.g., Speaker A's mother being a pediatrician, Star Wars novels), which obscures the context and does not reflect the development of interactions between Speaker A and Speaker B in the given conversation. As a result, MEMORY does not provide a comprehensive or coherent connection to the ongoing dialogue, diminishing its helpfulness."
