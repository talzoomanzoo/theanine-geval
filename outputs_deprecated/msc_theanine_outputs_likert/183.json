Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know. \nSpeaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like.\nSpeaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too.\nSpeaker B: Nice! Is anyone coming with you?\nSpeaker A: Just my doggy Drunky.  You never know,  I might meet a nice lady out there. \nSpeaker B: Totally.  There will be a bunch of women there and it'll be easy to strike up conversations.  Just be confident and I'm sure you could walk away with a bunch of numbers.\nSpeaker A: Oh, I definitely will. Thanks for the motivation. Is this going to me your first festival?\nSpeaker B: No, I used to go to them all the time.  This will be my first one in a while and probably my last since my wife and I are about to have our baby.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is not going out drinking much due to their wife's pregnancy. Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day. Speaker B's wife is pregnant and has three more months to go until the due date. \nSpeaker A owns a Subaru Legacy and mentions having a baby on the way. Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's exciting, it will be a memorable experience for you before the baby arrives. Enjoy the festival while you can!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does contain some information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it mentions Speaker B's wife's pregnancy, which is consistent with the final line in the dialogue where Speaker B mentions that this might be their last festival because they are about to have a baby. This provides important context for understanding Speaker B's consideration of attending the festival and offers a reason for their limited future participation. However, there are also some less relevant or inconsistent details, such as mentions of Speaker A having a baby on the way, which is not referenced in the provided dialogue. This reduces the overall cohesiveness and relevance of the MEMORY in relation to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY could be improved by focusing more on relevant details that directly support the development of events and interactions in the dialogue."
