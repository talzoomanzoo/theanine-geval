Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is getting a portrait done of themselves and their brother, interested in couponing deals. Speaker B is a painter and is working on a portrait for Speaker A. Speaker B has 5 dogs of different breeds and has rats as pets but didn't include them in the portrait. Speaker B is busy with school and taking care of their five dogs, so working at a doggy daycare would be too much. Speaker B is working on other portraits and taking care of a sick dog. Speaker B is an artist, did a painting for Elton John and has student debt from art school. Speaker A is getting their portrait painted by Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides pertinent information that helps understand the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It clearly establishes that Speaker B is a painter working on a portrait for Speaker A, which directly relates to Speaker A's mention of the portrait's progress. Additionally, it conveys Speaker B's responsibilities and distractions, such as their school obligations, pet care, and other painting commitments, which could influence the timeline or quality of the portrait. Furthermore, knowing Speaker B's experience, such as painting for Elton John, offers an understanding of their capabilities. However, while the MEMORY contains many relevant facts, the organization and emphasis on these details could be improved to better aid the language model in generating the subsequent response."
