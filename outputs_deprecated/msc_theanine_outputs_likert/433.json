Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\nSpeaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it.\nSpeaker A: Cool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot. What is your favorite part about camping?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout. This involvement has led Speaker A to appreciate Speaker B's dedication and invites them to a youth retreat. Speaker B wants to earn the Eagle Scout badge for college applications.\nSpeaker B is busy with scouts, school, work, and tennis, but is willing to take vacation days for the retreat. Additionally, Speaker B is considering attending a local community college for the first couple of years.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "My favorite part about camping is being able to disconnect from the busyness of everyday life and just enjoy nature.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for the language model to generate a proper response in the context of a conversation about Boy Scouts and camping. It effectively conveys the background of Speaker B, highlighting their extensive experience (7-8 years, currently a Life Scout) and their future goals (earning the Eagle Scout badge for college applications). This information is useful in responding to Speaker A's interest in Boy Scouts, as it establishes Speaker B's credibility and sincere involvement with the organization. The mention of Speaker B's being busy yet willing to take vacation days for a retreat also demonstrates their commitment, adding relational depth. Furthermore, speaking about college intent gives a fuller picture of Speaker B's life, adding a natural flow to the conversation even if it isn't immediately relevant to camping. Overall, the memory is well-structured and directly connected to the dialogue context, making it quite helpful for generating informed responses."
