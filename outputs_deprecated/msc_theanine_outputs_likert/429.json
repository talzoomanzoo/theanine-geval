    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing?\nSpeaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha!\nSpeaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes?\nSpeaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe. \nSpeaker A: You make them sounds so fascinating. Will you take them with you to your college dorm? \nSpeaker B: I'll be living off campus, so absolutely. How about you? Are you staying in the dorms?\nSpeaker A: I'm glad your taking them with you. My mum wants me to stay in dorms. But I think I just want my own place, less drama and more freedom that way.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is a student planning to go to college next year and wants to study neuroscience. Speaker B mentions studying Neuroscience classes next year, hinting at being a student. Speaker A plans to work with humans in neuroscience to help cure neurological diseases. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies. \nSpeaker A is working on becoming an Eagle Scout and volunteers at a research lab. Speaker B mentions studying Neuroscience classes next year, hinting at being a student. Speaker B is excited about taking neuroscience classes next year. Speaker B's classes related to neuroscience will start next year. \nSpeaker B recently divorced their wife and loves to scuba dive in Hawaii when not working. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "Living off campus does sound like a great way to have your own space. Plus, you can have your snakes with you!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information that are relevant and potentially helpful to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it includes details about Speaker B having two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel, which directly aligns with the context of the dialogue where Speaker B discusses their snakes. It also mentions Speaker B studying neuroscience and being a student, which ties into the broader context of their college plans discussed in the dialogue. Additionally, MEMORY captures Speaker A's college aspirations and their involvement in volunteering and research, which can provide useful background information. However, some data in MEMORY, such as Speaker B's divorce and scuba diving interests, are unrelated to the current dialogue context around snakes and college plans, making it less cohesive. Overall, while the MEMORY includes relevant information for the dialogue context, it could be more naturally structured to highlight the relevant interactions and connections between the speakers."
