Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company? Do you build computers or work on programming?\nSpeaker B: I do like my job. My job is to troubleshoot issues between the hardware and software, so I get to work with both.\nSpeaker A: That sounds interesting. That's great that you love your job, not many people do.\nSpeaker B: Love is a strong word! I do like it though. There have been jobs I hated and I'm great full not be in that place. Hows you job going?\nSpeaker A: Its going good. Its summer so we are really busy right now. I am just grateful to be back at work. How long have you worked for your company?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys Disney World more than their child, and Speaker A enjoys reading books about ice cream, Disney World, and computers, which causes Speaker A to be open to meeting for lunch and flexible with food choices. Speaker A works for a small local business with a demanding schedule, which is hindering their ability to meet for lunch, but they are still open to it. Speaker B wants to change careers but is unable to until their child graduates, while Speaker A is considering quitting their job to work at Disney World for happiness and is also interested in a career in dentistry.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some potentially relevant background information about Speaker A and Speaker B, but it is not directly connected to the dialogue context. There is information about their preferences (e.g., Speaker B enjoying Disney World and Speaker A enjoying reading about certain topics) and job situations (e.g., Speaker B wanting a career change and Speaker A considering a job at Disney World), but these do not directly relate to the current conversation about their current jobs and workplace experiences. The memory seems somewhat disjointed from the specific conversation at hand, and the details do not naturally support the next potential responses in the dialogue context. Overall, the MEMORY could be more helpful if it included more directly relevant information about the speakers' interactions or attitudes towards their jobs specifically."
