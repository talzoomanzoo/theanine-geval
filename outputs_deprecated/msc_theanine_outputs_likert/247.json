Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not!\nSpeaker B: Have you been hiking lately?\nSpeaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me.\nSpeaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway?\nSpeaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day! I'll make it as fun as possible.\nSpeaker B: I will someday. just not in the summer when all the bugs are out! Where do you go hiking the most?\nSpeaker A: I like to go hiking in the local trails here. I am familiar with them and there's so many routes that I can take. Sadly, the bugs are as bad here as they are anywhere else.....\nSpeaker B: They can't be that bad in the fall right? I hope? Do you camp most every weekend?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks, which has led to them planning several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail. They also lead hikes for the group they camp with, which are usually an hour or two long, but Speaker A is now nervous about the Appalachian Trail hike, as they don't usually do full day hikes. Additionally, Speaker A is a personal trainer who loves camping in remote areas and is comfortable around animals in the woods, although they admit a bear would make them jumpy.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I wish I could camp every weekend! But with my schedule, I usually try to go at least once a month. It's a great way for me to unwind and recharge.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful information that could help generate responses in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking, which aligns with their interest displayed in the current conversation. More specifically, it notes that Speaker A is leading hikes and planning trips, indicates their level of comfort with animals in the woods, and hints at their role as a personal trainer. However, the MEMORY lacks some direct connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as any recent hiking trips or bug-related concerns - even though it highlights Speaker A's plans and skills, some of the details may be extraneous for the current conversation. Though structured, the phrases do not always portray past interactions between speakers clearly enough to offer substantial context or cues. Therefore, the MEMORY is moderately helpful but could be improved with more specific links between past interactions and the current dialogue."
