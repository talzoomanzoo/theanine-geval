Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet? \nSpeaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name?\nSpeaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \nSpeaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along!\nSpeaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them.\nSpeaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me!\nSpeaker A: Hahaha. Yes I agree its too hot to get a long hike in. I've been on some short ones, but the bugs eat me alive. I like to hike in the fall when the bugs are dying off and its a little cooler.\nSpeaker B: Ah yes, that's my favorite time of year. Oh and speaking of Tasha, I'm still amazed she knows Mandarin. Have you been learning more of the language?\nSpeaker A: I've been learning a little more. I try to learn a few things a day. Tasha's reactions to my talking to myself in Mandarin is funny, she looks confused most of the time.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a pet parrot named Tasha who speaks Mandarin and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten. \nSpeaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities. \n\nSpeaker B lives in the city they grew up in, loves animals, and has a cat that recently had a kitten. \nSpeaker A has a pet named Tasha who speaks Mandarin and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's impressive how quickly animals adapt to different languages. Tasha must keep you entertained with her reactions to your Mandarin practice.",
    "prediction": "**Helpfulness Score: 3**\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information but also contains repetitive and slightly irrelevant details. \n\n1. Relevant Information: \n   - Speaker A has a pet parrot named Tasha who speaks Mandarin. This aligns well with the dialogue context where Speaker A mentions Tasha speaking Mandarin.\n   - Speaker A is interested in adopting a rescue kitten, which is relevant to the initial parts of the dialogue context where adopting kittens is discussed.\n\n2. Redundant Information:\n   - The MEMORY repeats details about Speaker A's interest in adopting a kitten and Tasha speaking Mandarin.\n   - Information about Speaker B filling out adoption paperwork, considering kitten names in Mandarin, having a cat who had a kitten, and living in their hometown are not directly beneficial for generating a response in the given dialogue context.\n\n3. Lack of Connection:\n   - There is no strong connection or development of interaction between the speakers in the MEMORY as it mostly lists individual facts about each speaker separately rather than integrating or showing causality between their past interactions.\n\nOverall, while the MEMORY gives some contextually relevant information, it is largely redundant and includes unrelated details, affecting its overall helpfulness in guiding the dialogue continuation."
