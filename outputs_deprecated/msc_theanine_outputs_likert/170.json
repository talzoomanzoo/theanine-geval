Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me?\nSpeaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week?\nSpeaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day\nSpeaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through\nSpeaker A: Actually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to it. Do you think I will need to rent a car when I'm there, or is it possible to walk and bike in the summer? I always picture huge amounts of snow but I'm not sure if it's like that all year round.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A invited Speaker B to visit and mentioned looking into flights, causing Speaker A to plan to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit.\n\nSpeaker A invited Speaker B to visit and mentioned looking into flights, causing Speaker B to plan to visit Speaker A and be interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n\nSpeaker B is interested in visiting Alaska and mentions getting blackout curtains due to the midnight sun, causing Speaker B to find flights that work for their schedule and price and will be visiting Speaker A in a couple of weeks, which in turn causes Speaker A to be excited about the trip.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "You might not need to rent a car, it's definitely possible to walk and bike around here in the summer. The snow melts pretty quickly once summer hits.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, especially regarding Speaker B's plans to visit and interest in attending concerts. However, some parts of the MEMORY are less relevant or off-topic, such as the mention of petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour, which haven't been discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the information about Speaker B getting blackout curtains isn't directly relevant to the current conversation. The memory does a fair job of providing a background to the speakers' past interactions, but it could be more focused on details that directly connect with the dialogue context, such as the discussion of flights, weather, or the necessity of renting a car."
