Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \n\nMEMORY:\n- Speaker A, a runner who dislikes traveling but has visited 20 countries, wants to improve their mile time and train for a marathon. This causes Speaker A to seek advice on marathon training and recovery. As a result, Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and scheduling a beach meeting at 0600.\n\n- Speaker B, who travels frequently for work and misses their wife and kids, wants to work on improving their mile time and train for a marathon like Speaker A. This causes Speaker A to seek advice on marathon training and recovery. Speaker B is considering running a marathon and has mentioned fishing and feeling depressed, which is a similar topic to Speaker A's marathon training.\n\n- Speaker A, a runner who dislikes traveling but has visited 20 countries, wants Speaker B to get into motivational speaking. This change occurred after Speaker B ran a marathon and found it tough but rewarding. Speaker B got into motivational speaking as a way to battle depression and anxiety, a topic they joked about while mentioning fishing and feeling depressed.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad you enjoyed the speech. I might know someone who could help with that. Let me check and get back to you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains several pieces of information that offer helpful context for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memories outline the shared interests in marathons and motivational speaking between Speakers A and B, and detail how these interests have intertwined in their past interactions.\n\nThe connections between the details are clearly demonstrated: Speaker A and B both want to improve their mile times and are interested in marathon training. This aligns with the current dialogue, where Speaker A is inquiring about the success of a motivational speech and is humorously asking if Speaker B can motivate them and their friend to run. The fact that Speaker B got into motivational speaking as a way to cope with depression also provides useful context for generating a response related to motivation and running, as mentioned by Speaker A.\n\nThe memories are presented in a logically structured manner, providing background information that directly pertains to the topics discussed in the dialogue context. This makes it easy for a language model to process the memories and identify relevant cues, particularly relating to running, motivational speaking, and mutual support in training for marathons. Even the extra details, such as past conversations about fishing and depression, are naturally presented, offering depth to Speaker B's character and their motivations.\n\nOverall, the memory achieves coherence and connection in terms of the past interactions shared between the speakers and relates to the given context. This quality contributes to the score of 4."
