    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\nSpeaker A knows how to swim since the age of 5 and offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\nSpeaker B does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies; looking forward to eating a pizza burger in a pool with punk music playing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information regarding Speaker B's enjoyment of punk music and their interest in swimming, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about the playlist featuring punk music. It also reveals that Speaker B does not know how to swim, which corresponds to their hope of learning to swim mentioned in the context. Additionally, the MEMORY mentions Speaker A's swimming skills and willingness to teach Speaker B, which could be beneficial in generating a realistic response.\n\nThe connections between these details are clearly emphasized, demonstrating relevance and development related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the detail about eating a pizza burger in a pool seems less directly relevant to the current context and slightly detracts from the focus, which prevents a perfect score. Overall, the MEMORY is well-organized and mostly helpful for generating an appropriate next response."
