Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing?\nSpeaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from?\nSpeaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A wants a family portrait from Speaker B, who is an artist, did a painting for Elton John, and has student debt from art school. Speaker B is currently working on a portrait for Speaker A and also working on other portraits while taking care of a sick dog.\n\n2. Speaker B's prices for a portrait have changed to starting at $5000 to pay for college tuition. Speaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals, discovered love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets, thinks pit bulls are lovely, and has a kind and sweet pit bull. Speaker B also likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions. Speaker A is considering getting kittens and thinks rats can be smart.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's wonderful! Shelter cats are the best. I can't wait to see which one you choose for your family portrait.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful background about Speaker A and Speaker B's relationship, specifically regarding the portrait work and their shared interest in pets. This is somewhat helpful as it gives context to Speaker A's question about the new cat and Speaker B's interest in painting pets. However, much of the MEMORY is tangential and not directly relevant to the specific dialogue context at hand. Details such as the past work for Elton John, college tuition, or specific prices for portraits don't directly apply to the current conversation. Additionally, some of the information, such as Speaker B's opinion on pit bulls and Persian cats or the idea of pets having interactions, doesn't clearly contribute to helping generate a response in the current context. The structure of MEMORY is coherent, but could be more focused on directly applicable information to earn a higher score."
