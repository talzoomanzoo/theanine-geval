Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\nSpeaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call!\nSpeaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip? \nSpeaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery\nSpeaker B: Yes I think that's a great idea, how is work at the library? \nSpeaker A: Busy, and demanding because we are short staffed. While there seems to be little need for a library these days, I find that we have less staff to get everything done\nSpeaker B: Well if you ever need someone to come and help for a couple of hours here and there, give me a call, you know how much I love to be in the library anyway\nSpeaker A: I will keep that in mind as we do have volunteer hours available. How is your family doing these days?\nSpeaker B: Well I would be happy to help. My family are all great thank you for asking I took the grandkids to the park again we had a great time. How's your family doing? \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, having a lot of kids who are now grown up and have kids of their own, causes Speaker A to be busy with work and unable to spend as much time with their own kids as they would like. Speaker B, in contrast, wants to spend time with their grandkids at the park and enjoys it. This causes Speaker B to like the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature. Additionally, Speaker A has children and grandchildren, with at least one child interested in learning the flute.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "My family is doing well, thank you for asking. It's great to hear that you had a wonderful time at the park with your grandkids.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context that is relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's enjoyment of spending time with their grandkids and the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition. These are relevant to the conversation about family and the fishing trip in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY also inaccurately suggests that Speaker A's busyness with work is due to Speaker B having a lot of kids, which is not mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY could be improved by focusing on more relevant interactions and mentioning Speaker A's library work and challenges or the volunteer offer by Speaker B. The information about children and grandchildren, while useful to understand the dynamic, is presented in a way that could be better structured or more directly connected to specific elements in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, the MEMORY provides some helpful context but lacks clarity and precision to receive a higher score."
