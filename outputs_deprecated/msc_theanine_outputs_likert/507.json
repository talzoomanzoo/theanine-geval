Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive.\nSpeaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price?\nSpeaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music\nSpeaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it.\nSpeaker A: I'll keep trying! Have you had any luck lately?\nSpeaker B: No I haven't! I keep hoping that I will so I can buy my dreamhouse but I know the chances are low.\nSpeaker A: Would you move to the city? It'd be too much for me\nSpeaker B: I would love to be able to have a country house and a city house to be able to come and go to each one as I please. doesn't that sound like a dream come true?\nSpeaker A: It would be convenient for seeing concerts in the city, yes. I'm not used to the business, though\nSpeaker B: Yeah I understand that. Have you listened to any new blues songs lately?\nSpeaker A: I've started a playlist but haven't had time yet. Any recommendations for female blues performers?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B have a friendly interaction and part ways on a positive note. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B and their family could stay over at the farm after the concert, as they both dream of having a city and country house or a summer and winter home. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win, as they both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot. \n\nSpeaker A has never been to college and values the peaceful life of working on the farm. Speaker B expresses interest in potentially moving out of the city and enjoying a more peaceful life on the farm, as they both dream of having a city and country house or a summer and winter home.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "How about checking out artists like Etta James or Koko Taylor? They have some amazing blues songs that you might enjoy.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker A and Speaker B's mutual interest in having both city and country homes, which ties into the discussion in the dialogue about winning the lottery and the dream of owning multiple homes. The idea of a peaceful life on a farm also connects with the conversation about the hustle and bustle of city life. This shared dream and lifestyle aspiration offer context for their conversation, reinforcing their friendly relationship and similar values.\n\nHowever, some parts of the MEMORY are less directly related to the ongoing dialogue, such as the mention of strategies for playing the lotto, which were not explicitly discussed in the dialogue. Additionally, the fact that Speaker A hasn't been to college, while interesting, doesn't directly pertain to the topic at hand in the Dialogue Context.\n\nOverall, MEMORY provides relevant context and background that can aid in generating Speaker B's next response, but it includes some extraneous details that are less connected to the immediate dialogue context."
