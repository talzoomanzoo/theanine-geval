Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys painting and taking naps, but is not entirely satisfied with their current job and wishes it was more rewarding. They have a government job that pays the bills but dreams of working in interior design. Speaker B also feels conflicted about their government job, likening it to having tenure as a college professor.\n\nSpeaker A recently moved to a new city and has two older brothers. The change in location has made job searching challenging for Speaker A, who hopes to settle in the new city soon with a steady income. They are currently preparing for an upcoming interview and feeling nervous about it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I have considered it, but I worry about the stability and financial security of pursuing a creative career full time.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives insight into Speaker B's feelings about their current job and their dream of working in interior design, which directly relates to Speaker A's question about pursuing something creative and fulfilling. Additionally, the MEMORY provides background on Speaker A's recent move and job search struggles, which, while not directly related to the question, could be contextually relevant for generating a response. The MEMORY is structured in a way that clearly outlines past interactions and helps identify important contextual cues, thus aiding the generation of a proper response. However, the MEMORY could be slightly more connected or detailed in certain aspects to warrant a perfect score."
