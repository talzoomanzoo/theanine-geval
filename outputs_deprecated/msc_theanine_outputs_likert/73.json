Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play? \nSpeaker B: I don't know play instrument.

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": " I learned to surf when I was a kid, just spending a lot of time in the water. It's all about practice and patience, like learning any new skill.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information that could be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, especially around the topic of surfing. Speaker B asks how Speaker A learned surfing, and the MEMORY notes that Speaker A grew up on the beach in California, loves morning surfing, and is good at it. This provides a solid basis for Speaker A to elaborate on their surfing experience. However, the rest of the MEMORY other than the detail about surfing doesn't closely relate to the immediate dialogue around instruments and music, limiting its helpfulness score. Additionally, repetitive details about Speaker A's surfing habits, in the MEMORY, do not add value. The mention of Speaker A enjoying eating fish is irrelevant to the dialogue context, showing a disconnect, yet it is phrased naturally. For these reasons, a score of 3 is appropriate."
