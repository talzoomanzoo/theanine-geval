Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for.\nSpeaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for?\nSpeaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\nSpeaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise? \nSpeaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows.\nSpeaker A: That sounds wonderful! You'd get to just be out in nature all day. Sounds like a great job, especially if you're a bit introverted like me. That's why hiking is my favorite -- a good solitary activity. \nSpeaker B: Yes, I agree. What kind of hours would this new job have?\nSpeaker A: It's third shift, which isn't the greatest, but it pays a bit more than the other shifts, and I think I'll like getting off early in the morning. Then I can just go down and get in my hammock and have a nice relaxing moment after work. \nSpeaker B: Would you feel safe being out there all alone, possibly falling asleep? That just sounds a bit risky.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys camping, hiking, and is kind, caring, and hopeful for group equality. Speaker A plans to potentially visit the Columbia Trail and Ken Lockwood Gorge for a camping and hiking trip. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n\nSpeaker B enjoys camping, hiking, and is kind, caring, and hopeful for group equality. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking, mentioning setting up a hammock at their campsite. Speaker A and Speaker B have gone hiking together before and plan to meet up for another hike. Speaker A suggests bringing water for the hike and mentions having a picnic at the top of the mountain.\n\nSpeaker A does not care about voting and plans to send their parents a postcard. Speaker A is looking for a job and new camping gear, specifically a hammock. Speaker A will use the money earned from the store to buy the hammock online.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've thought about that. I plan to set up my hammock in a safe spot and not too far from the house, so I'll be cautious. Plus, I can always set an alarm to make sure I wake up on time.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains useful information to support the language model in generating responses, such as Speaker A applying to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail, their interest in camping and hiking, and looking for a hammock. However, there is mention in DIALOGUE CONTEXT of Speaker A applying for a job, which could benefit from the job-related memory entries. Additionally, it contains memories of Speaker B's interests and characteristics, which might not be directly relevant to generating the next response based on the current dialogue context. Despite this, the memory is mostly relevant and naturally structured. It lacks a direct connection to the current concern about safety while resting in a hammock, which is an immediate topic of the conversation. Overall, the memory is somewhat helpful but doesn't closely align with and expand on all aspects of the ongoing dialogue."
