Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not!\nSpeaker B: Have you been hiking lately?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys camping and hiking as free activities, which has led to them planning several camping trips for the summer and doing a part of the Appalachian Trail. Speaker A, who works as a personal trainer leading hikes, is nervous about the Appalachian Trail hike as they don't usually do full day hikes. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it, which is similar to Speaker A's love for camping and hiking.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Not lately, but I'm planning a few camping trips for the summer.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for generating a proper response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker A enjoys hiking and camping, which aligns with their action of using mosquito repellents for outdoor activities. Additionally, it notes that Speaker A is planning a hike on the Appalachian Trail and feels nervous about it due to their inexperience with full-day hikes. This detail about Speaker A's nervousness is particularly relevant as it offers an opportunity to connect with Speaker B's question about recent hiking experience.\n\nThe MEMORY also indicates Speaker B's recent hiking experience and enjoyment, which can further enhance the interaction as both speakers share a common interest in hiking. The overall context provided by MEMORY aligns well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and is phrased clearly, making it easy for a language model to identify and utilize relevant cues. However, while it provides good background information, the MEMORY could be slightly more concise and interconnected to achieve a perfect score."
