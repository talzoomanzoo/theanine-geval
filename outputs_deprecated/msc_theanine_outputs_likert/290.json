Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \nSpeaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with?\nSpeaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point.\nSpeaker A: Yes, it contains eggs.  I think you would do well with the fried rice. It's best to cook the rice the day before.  \nSpeaker B: I didn't know that. Why cook the rice beforehand? Is it better to age rice or something?\nSpeaker A: The rice needs to be cool before adding to the pan.  Are you able to take a passenger along in you truck?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys cooking and baking, possibly considering turning it into a business. This interest in cooking leads Speaker A to primarily cook Indian food and bake a lot of rice dishes. Speaker A also bakes muffins and bread but is conscious of their impact on their weight. Additionally, Speaker A recommends the pressure cooker for its efficiency and ease of use, suggesting it to Speaker B who is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker A enjoys cooking and baking, which aligns with them recommending recipes to Speaker B. Furthermore, Speaker A's experience with rice dishes can provide them credibility in advising on the fried rice recipe, which is relevant to their discussion in the context. The suggestion about the pressure cooker also connects to the context where Speaker A talks about cooking rice with it. However, the MEMORY does not fully serve the dialogue because it does not directly address Speaker A's specific experience with Asian cuisine or shrimp fried rice and lacks specificity in the past interactions between the two speakers concerning their cooking discussions. Overall, while MEMORY provides some helpful context about Speaker A's cooking interests, it could be more directly tied to the specifics of the current context to achieve a higher score."
