Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is planning to retire down south on a beach for warm weather, having visited Alaska and describing it as beautiful, and suggesting cheap flights to Anchorage. This led Speaker B to find flights that work for their schedule and price, resulting in them planning to visit Speaker A in a couple of weeks. Speaker A has then invited Speaker B to visit them and is excited about the upcoming trip. \nSpeaker B, who enjoys warm days, cool mornings, and eating poached eggs, is now interested in visiting Alaska and considering getting blackout curtains due to the midnight sun. This interest led Speaker A to invite Speaker B to visit and mention looking into flights. As a result, Speaker B is now planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in activities like going to a concert, petting a wolf, and going on a glacier tour. \nSpeaker A, who drives a smart car and used to have a long commute in Alaska, has visited the state and found it beautiful, suggesting cheap flights to Anchorage. This suggestion led Speaker B to find suitable flights, resulting in them planning to visit Speaker A soon. Speaker A is looking forward to the visit and has extended an invitation to Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I found some good flights that work for my schedule. I'm excited to visit you soon!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY provides detailed and coherent background information that is directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures the primary topic of conversation—Speaker B visiting Speaker A—and outlines the progression of events leading up to the current dialogue turn. The MEMORY contains clearly connected sentences explaining past interactions, such as Speaker A's invitations and suggestions of cheap flights, Speaker B's scheduling considerations, and their shared excitement about the upcoming trip. The information is well-structured, demonstrating causality and relevancy, which would aid a language model in generating a contextually appropriate and informed next response. Even the peripheral details about Speaker A's retirement plans and Speaker B's preferences are cohesively integrated, helping the model understand the broader context of their conversation."
