Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is studying sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school, causing Speaker A to struggle to maintain good grades and find gym to be the only subject they excel in.\nSpeaker B is on their way to college and studying sports medicine, resulting in Speaker A wishing to get better grades and being hopeful for a soccer scholarship, while Speaker B has been getting all A's in the sports medicine class.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B studying sports medicine and the pressure to maintain straight A's, which might affect their performance in exams. However, the MEMORY also includes information about Speaker A, such as their struggle with grades and aspirations for a soccer scholarship, which may not be directly relevant or helpful for Speaker B's response to the exam question. The sentences in MEMORY are somewhat connected in terms of the academic and sports themes, but they are not very clearly structured with respect to their relevance to Speaker B's experience or response to the exam question in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
