Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. \nSpeaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me.\nSpeaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house. \nSpeaker B: Understandable. Have you ever tried contacting animal control? That's how I got Bandicoot. I was working that day and animal control came by explaining about needing fosters for raccoons. I thought it was weird, so I did it and began to work at the small raccoon cafe that is part of the zoo. I love it. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is interested in animals, specifically raccoons and bearded dragons. \nSpeaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it. \nSpeaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly. \nSpeaker B's garbage has a lock to prevent animals from getting into it, especially during windy weather. \nSpeaker B works at a Raccoon Cafe and takes care of Bandicoot, a raccoon.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains relevant details about both speakers that connect to the ongoing conversation about raccoons. The MEMORY informs us of Speaker A's interest in raccoons, which aligns with their discussion about dealing with raccoon problems. Speaker B's involvement with raccoons and employment at a Raccoon Cafe is also relevant to the conversation. The aspect of Speaker B taking care of a raccoon named Bandicoot ties into the suggestion that raccoons can become pets. These details help in understanding the speakers' perspectives and provide a backdrop for generating informed responses. However, the statement about Speaker A being interested in bearded dragons does not contribute specifically to the current context, and the mention of a garbage lock being related to Speaker B is inaccurately placed; Speaker B's garbage issues are not discussed in the context. Despite these minor discrepancies, the MEMORY is mostly coherent and supportive of the dialogue's themes."
