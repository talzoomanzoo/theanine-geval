Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin!\nSpeaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name? \nSpeaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls! \nSpeaker B: I see what you meant. Plus the color is beautiful orange. I want to see them together, even I am not a cat person they must be cute together at that time. Once the kitten grows up, situation gonna change to me. How are they, they are doing well?\nSpeaker A: Marmalade is orange too but this is better because the baby is sassy and climbs up my leg to sit on my shoulder. I don't understand how you are not a cat person when you have such a large heart for stray kittens.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten, which they enjoy taking on trips. Speaker A has a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Marmalade. \nSpeaker B loves dogs and is excited for the trip, looking forward to trying the best iced tea.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I guess I just never had a strong connection to cats growing up, but I can definitely appreciate their playful nature. Pumpkin sounds like quite the character already!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some context that is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A having a cat named Ginger and considering naming a new kitten Marmalade, which relates to the conversation about naming the kitten Pumpkin. However, the information about Speaker A having a Subaru and taking the kitten on trips, as well as Speaker B loving dogs and looking forward to a trip for iced tea, does not provide helpful information directly related to the ongoing conversation about the kitten's name and the characteristics of Speaker A's cats. The MEMORY lacks details on the past interactions between the speakers that could contribute more specifically to understanding the context of the current dialogue."
