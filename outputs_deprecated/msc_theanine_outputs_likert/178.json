Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know. \nSpeaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like.\nSpeaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys Mexican food and drinks, and plays music for fun. This interest leads to Speaker A frequenting live band venues and playing music at home. The topic of music is also shared with Speaker B, as both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n\nSpeaker A owns a Subaru Legacy and mentions having a baby on the way, causing Speaker B's wife to be pregnant and currently in the second trimester while still working. Due to the pregnancy, Speaker B's wife is considering attending a local festival for just a day. This topic of family planning is further explored when Speaker A expresses uncertainty about settling down with a partner and having kids.\n\nEven though Speaker A does not live in Mexico, they enjoy Mexican food and women. This preference contrasts with Speaker B, who is not going out drinking much due to their wife's pregnancy. Both Speaker A and Speaker B, however, engage in discussions about the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great plan! It'll be nice to have everyone together for the festival.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that both Speaker A and Speaker B have a shared interest in bluegrass music, which is directly connected to the context of discussing a Bluegrass show and accommodations. Additionally, it provides context on Speaker B's wife's pregnancy, which is relevant to the discussion about comfortable accommodations and camping. The MEMORY also mentions that both speakers have discussed the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby, providing further contextual clues that relate to planning for the Bluegrass festival. The sentences are naturally structured, and the causal relationships are clear, allowing the language model to easily identify valuable context for generating a response. However, some unrelated personal preferences (e.g., Mexican food and women, Subaru Legacy) are included, which slightly detracts from the direct relevance. Thus, the MEMORY is quite helpful but not perfectly focused, resulting in a score of 4."
