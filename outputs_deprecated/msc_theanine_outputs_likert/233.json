Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet? \nSpeaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name?\nSpeaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \nSpeaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along!\nSpeaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A, a country girl who loves animals and is a lacto-ovo vegetarian, has a pet named Tasha who speaks Mandarin. Speaker B, who lives in the city they grew up in and loves animals, has two sick kitties and recently received a rescue kitten. Speaker A, with a pet parrot named Tasha and red hair that makes them stand out, is interested in adopting a rescue kitten despite having a parrot.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Tasha sounds like quite the character. It would definitely be interesting to see how she interacts with the new kittens!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker A has a pet parrot named Tasha, which aligns with their concerns about whether Tasha would get along with the kittens. The fact that Tasha speaks Mandarin, although not immediately relevant to the current dialogue, expands on the character background and adds depth to the conversation. The MEMORY also notes Speaker A's interest in adopting rescue kittens, which is directly connected to the dialogue where they mention looking into adopting kittens. Speaker B's background with sick kitties and a rescue kitten ties into the earlier parts of the conversation where they recommend adopting kittens. Overall, the MEMORY effectively connects to the past and current interactions between the speakers, presenting the information cohesively and logically."
