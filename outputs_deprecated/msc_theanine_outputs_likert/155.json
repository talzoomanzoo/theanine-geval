Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it!\nSpeaker B: I'm glad you liked it. My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys watching movies with her kids. This includes romance and horror movies, which their kids do not enjoy. Speaker B also finds Disney movies good, especially as a small escape into a new world. Speaker B's husband, on the other hand, enjoys Disney sports movies like 'Miracle'.\nSpeaker B is a stay-at-home mom, which causes her kids to enjoy watching Disney movies, something that Speaker B also finds good. The movie 'Miracle' is about the 1980 U.S. hockey team.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides moderately helpful information for generating a proper next response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights that Speaker B enjoys watching movies with her kids and that her husband specifically enjoys Disney sports movies, such as 'Miracle'. This is directly relevant to the context where Speaker A mentions watching 'Miracle' as per Speaker B's suggestion. The MEMORY also mentions Speaker B's role as a stay-at-home mom and her preference for certain movie genres, although these details are less directly relevant to the specific conversation at hand. Overall, the MEMORY is well-structured, providing a clear picture of Speaker B's personal context and preferences in relation to movies, which aids in understanding her past interactions with Speaker A."
