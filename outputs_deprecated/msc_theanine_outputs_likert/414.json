Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin!\nSpeaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name? \nSpeaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls! \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A used to have a Mini car, which is smaller compared to Speaker B's Subaru, but now Speaker A has a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Marmalade. \nSpeaker A usually leaves their cats with a friend while traveling, but now Speaker B ends up taking care of stray cats brought home by kids. \nSpeaker A has a kitten from their cat and enjoys taking them on trips, and Speaker B is excited for the trip and looking forward to trying the best iced tea.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: While the MEMORY provides some information, much of it is not directly relevant or helpful for generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker A's history with cars and their decision regarding a kitten's name, which is somewhat related since there's a reference to the kitten's name. However, the rest of the MEMORY discusses other details about travel and care for cats, which do not directly connect to the current dialogue about the kitten's name change. The details are somewhat fragmented and don't show a clear development or connection to the context, making it difficult for a language model to extract useful cues from it. Thus, it lacks helpfulness in guiding the next response."
