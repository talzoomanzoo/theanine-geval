Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\nSpeaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call!\nSpeaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip? \nSpeaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery\nSpeaker B: Yes I think that's a great idea, how is work at the library? \nSpeaker A: Busy, and demanding because we are short staffed. While there seems to be little need for a library these days, I find that we have less staff to get everything done\nSpeaker B: Well if you ever need someone to come and help for a couple of hours here and there, give me a call, you know how much I love to be in the library anyway\nSpeaker A: I will keep that in mind as we do have volunteer hours available. How is your family doing these days?\nSpeaker B: Well I would be happy to help. My family are all great thank you for asking I took the grandkids to the park again we had a great time. How's your family doing? \nSpeaker A: They are good. I wish I coudl spend more time with them but my job is keeping me busy. I do hope they take up some hobbies that involve the outdoors or something more creative.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B mentioning having grandkids implies they are older and have a family of their own. Speaker B enjoys spending time with their grandkids at the park, causing them to like the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\nSpeaker A being busy with work and unable to spend as much time with their kids as they would like makes Speaker A want to spend more time with their family. Speaker B enjoying time with their grandkids at the park triggers Speaker A to wish their family would take up hobbies involving the outdoors or something more creative.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I understand, family time is precious. Maybe you can plan some outdoor activities with them in advance to make sure you all get to spend quality time together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a decent amount of helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures the essence of the conversation, explaining the dynamics between the two speakers regarding the topics they discussed. It notes Speaker B's fondness for spending time with grandkids and connection to outdoor activities, which is relevant to the conversation about the fishing trip and spending quality family time. Additionally, the MEMORY touches on Speaker A's busyness with work and desire for their family to engage in outdoor or creative hobbies. These points closely follow the conversations in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and provide context for the language model to generate an informed response. However, while the information is relatively concise and connected, there could be more explicit connections or details about past interactions to provide a full context, which is why it does not score a perfect 5."
