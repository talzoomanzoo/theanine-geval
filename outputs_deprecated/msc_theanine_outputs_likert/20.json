Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\nSpeaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car?\nSpeaker B: Yes, there are several. Hope we could meet and You possibly teach me about computer programming.\nSpeaker A: That would be great too. I like to program in several different languages. Do you have a preference?\nSpeaker B: No, I'm just getting started so I don't have a preference. Maybe you could show me what you prefer and we could start there.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B works as a shipping clerk at warehouse for 15 hours a week. Speaker A just started a new job in computer programming. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming. \nSpeaker B does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming. \nSpeaker B enjoys cruising in their car while listening to punk music. Speaker A enjoys the food and the adventure of cruises. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Perfect, we can start with Python, it's a great language to begin with. I'll show you the basics.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information that can aid Speaker A in generating an appropriate next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY mentions key aspects like Speaker A's willingness to teach Speaker B swimming and programming, which directly aligns with the current dialogue about these topics. It also highlights Speaker B's interest in punk music, a detail that is relevant to the playlist discussed. Additionally, MEMORY contains information about Speaker B's interest in car cruising and possible cruising adventures with Speaker A, which matches the dialogue's mention of the Caribbean cruise. While not every sentence in MEMORY is directly related to the dialogue context, the overall structure is naturally connected and provides useful contextual cues for developing the conversation. Therefore, it deserves a score of 4, as it effectively summarizes their past interactions and valuable contextual details."
