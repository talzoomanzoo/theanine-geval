    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. \nSpeaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, who works as a zoo keeper and enjoys it, has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it. Speaker B also considers raccoons intelligent and funny, and believes they can make good pets if cared for properly. Additionally, Speaker B's garbage has a lock to prevent animals from getting into it, especially during windy weather. Speaker B has a dog named Bandicoot and is willing to bring him over for extra company.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm a bit hesitant to befriend them. I'll see how the sheeting works first. By the way, how is Bandicoot adjusting to being at the zoo with you?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It reveals that Speaker B is a zoo keeper who takes an interest in raccoons, which aligns with their suggestion of befriending raccoons. This connection shows a consistent development in Speaker B's character and their interactions with raccoons. Additionally, the MEMORY mentions Bandicoot, Speaker B's dog, who is also referred to in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, reinforcing the context even more. While the information about Speaker B's garbage lock and their willingness to bring Bandicoot over might not be directly relevant, it is naturally phrased and does not hinder understanding. Overall, MEMORY enhances the context and supports the dialogue, although it could be slightly more concise."
