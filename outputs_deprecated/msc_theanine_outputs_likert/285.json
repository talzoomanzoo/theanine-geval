Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \nSpeaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys cooking and baking, possibly considering turning it into a business. Speaker A primarily cooks Indian food and bakes a lot of rice dishes. Speaker A owns a farm and enjoys cooking and baking. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\nSpeaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work. Speaker B's husband is a great cook and Speaker B is not skilled in cooking. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker. Speaker B also mentions having a farm with animals like chickens, ducks, pigs, goats, and growing crops like corn, strawberries, and pumpkins.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I would recommend starting with a simple and delicious recipe like a chicken curry or a vegetable stir-fry. It's a great way to get comfortable using the pressure cooker.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful context for the language model to generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes relevant information about Speaker A's enjoyment and experience in cooking, especially using a pressure cooker, which directly relates to the current conversation about pressure cooker recipes. It also mentions Speaker A's focus on Indian cuisine, which can help align the recommendation of Asian recipes. Additionally, the MEMORY gives insight into Speaker B's husband's cooking preferences and skills, which is relevant since the conversation is about finding recipes for him. The detail about both speakers having farms adds more to their background but isn't directly related to the current dialogue. The MEMORY is well-structured, connecting past interactions effectively and providing sufficient context about the dialogue, but some parts of the MEMORY, like farming details, are less relevant, keeping the score from being a perfect 5."
