Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read.\n\nMEMORY:\n- [Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix.] - (SameTopic) - [Speaker A enjoys watching movies with their grandchildren.] \n- [Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix.] - (SameTopic) - [Speaker A enjoys watching Jeopardy with their grandchildren and cooking for them, with the busiest time being the weekend.]\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It indicates that Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books, which is directly related to the context where Speaker A mentions reading a book. Additionally, the memory highlights Speaker A's interest in watching Netflix and spending time with their grandchildren, which could be relevant for further dialogue. The two memory entries are connected, providing a clearer picture of Speaker A's interests and routine. However, there is some repetition between the entries, which slightly detracts from the score. Overall, the MEMORY is quite useful, with naturally structured sentences that effectively convey past interactions and interests of Speaker A."
