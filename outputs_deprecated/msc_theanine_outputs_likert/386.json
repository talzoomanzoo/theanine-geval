Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons\nSpeaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use.\nSpeaker B: I am a little scared of needles though. Were your tattoos painful?\nSpeaker A: Most of them were not.  It really depends on where on your body you get them.  Most of mine are on areas that didn't hurt.  The one on my foot and the one behind my ear did hurt a good bit.  Where were you thinking about getting it?\nSpeaker B: I hadn't really thought about it! Maybe upper arm or upper back? But I'm no tattoo expert. And I'd have to get permission from my wife first, LOL\nSpeaker A: Definitely talk to her first.  I had a friend that didn't talk to his wife and just came home with a tattoo one day.  It led to a huge fight - both about the money he spent and not discussing it with her.  He slept on my couch for over a week!\nSpeaker B: Oh no! Yeah, you don't want to spring something like that on your spouse. I don't think you mentioned before, are you married?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest because Speaker A works at a coffee shop that their mom owned.\n2. Speaker A wants to work at a coffee shop and is saving up for their next tattoo because Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father.\n3. Speaker A wants to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest because Speaker A's favorite tattoo is the one dedicated to their late father, saying \"for you I shall live\".\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm not married, but I have seen firsthand how important communication is in a relationship, especially when it comes to tattoos.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A's intention to get a tattoo in honor of their father, which aligns with the discussion in the context about getting tattoos for parents. However, the MEMORY is somewhat repetitive, with several similar sentences offering slight variations in detail. The connection to the topic of honoring parents through tattoos is present, but the details about working at a coffee shop and the specific slogan are not directly relevant or helpful in generating the next response about the current conversation's direction. Additionally, the MEMORY lacks the natural development and connectivity to broader aspects of the conversation, making it less helpful overall."
