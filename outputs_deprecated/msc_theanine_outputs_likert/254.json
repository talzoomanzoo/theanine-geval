Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\nSpeaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\nSpeaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\nSpeaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A used to help their father on a farm in the past, while Speaker B's dad works on smaller projects and has never been involved in a major Hollywood film. Speaker B now creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\n\n2. Speaker B's father was involved in producing horror movies, which influenced Speaker B's favorite genre. Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them. Speaker A also likes mid-century design and is a fan of horror movies.\n\n3. Speaker B's father was involved in producing horror movies, which influenced Speaker B's favorite genre. As a result, Speaker B's dad's work on smaller projects allows him more free time for hobbies like fishing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That must have been quite a shocking moment on set! It sounds like working on horror movies involves some unexpected twists and turns.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but is not perfectly aligned or structured for maximizing usefulness. The MEMORY mentions Speaker B's involvement in horror movies, which directly connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where they discuss making horror movies. This helps provide background on Speaker Bâ€™s interest in horror films and adds depth to the conversation. However, the MEMORY doesn't go into much depth about the creative aspect or how Speaker B came to work in horror films. Additionally, some details, such as Speaker A's interest in mid-century design or the fathers' background, might not be directly relevant to the current conversation and can confuse the context. The structure of the MEMORY can aid in understanding some of the past interactions, but it needs to be more focused and relevant to score higher."
