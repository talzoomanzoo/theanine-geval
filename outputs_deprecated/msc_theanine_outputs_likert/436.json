Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\nSpeaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it.\nSpeaker A: Cool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot. What is your favorite part about camping?\nSpeaker B: I love being out in the wilderness and sleeping under the stars in the fresh air. It makes you realize how beautiful life is and how small we really are in comparison to the universe.\nSpeaker A: I miss doing that! I have done lots of picnics with my family but it's been a long time since I've slept in a tent! Looking forward to it again when the kids are older. Where was the last place you went?\nSpeaker B: We went up to an island in the middle of nowhere in Canada. There were lots of bears and huge moose!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A wants more children and feels lonely due to their husband's frequent traveling. Speaker A suggested that Speaker B join one of the church retreats in the future. Speaker B appreciates Speaker A's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat. Speaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout.\n\nSpeaker B is not yet in college but hopes to become an Eagle Scout. Speaker A is involved in church activities and mentioned a church retreat. Speaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat. Speaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout.\n\nSpeaker B is not yet in college but hopes to become an Eagle Scout. Speaker B has not taken any vacations recently but has vacation days saved up. Speaker B is busy with scouts, school, work, and tennis, but willing to take vacation days for the retreat. Speaker B is considering attending a local community college for the first couple of years.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "Wow, that sounds like quite the adventure! I'm sure your scouting experiences will make for great stories to share with the kids.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information that could be helpful for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly about Speaker B's involvement in scouting, their appreciation for Speaker A's involvement, and Speaker B's aspirations to become an Eagle Scout. These details can aid Speaker A in crafting a response that acknowledges Speaker B's past experiences and expresses shared interests in such activities. However, much of the MEMORY focuses on details about church activities and Speaker A's personal feelings, which are not directly related to the ongoing dialogue about camping and survival skills. The MEMORY also excessively repeats some details, such as Speaker B's aim of becoming an Eagle Scout and their involvement duration in the Boy Scouts, which does not add new value to the conversation. Additionally, the MEMORY includes speakers' college and work plans which are irrelevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, the helpfulness is moderate."
