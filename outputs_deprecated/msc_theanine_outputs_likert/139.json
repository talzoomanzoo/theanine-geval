Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\nSpeaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach?\nSpeaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option.\nSpeaker A: Yes I think history is interesting, too! Both of those subjects would be great because there are probably lots of teaching jobs. What kind of history do you like?\nSpeaker B: I love all sorts of history. Right now I am really getting into the weeds of World War II. There's so much to unpack.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, majoring in linguistics and aspiring to turn it into a practical job, causes Speaker A to be interested in teaching computer science, particularly in the field of robotics.\nSpeaker B, living with their mom and currently in college, wants to pursue a masters degree after finishing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. This leads Speaker B to feel limited in job opportunities but also sparks an interest in studying linguistics.\nSpeaker B, majoring in linguistics and hoping to turn it into a practical job, wants Speaker A, who is studying computer science and aims to develop apps for differently abled youth, to be interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "World War II is such a fascinating period to study. The impact it had on the world is immense. Have you considered specializing in a particular aspect of history for your teaching career?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided offers some context about Speaker B's background and aspirations, particularly their major in linguistics and potential career paths such as becoming a college professor. However, the MEMORY includes incorrect information such as \"Speaker A being interested in teaching computer science\" which doesn't align with the dialogue context where Speaker A is explicitly more interested in teaching robotics.\n\nThe information about Speaker B living with their mom and aiming for a master's degree is somewhat relevant but not directly helpful for generating a response in this specific dialogue context, as it doesn't align with the flow or the ongoing conversation's focus. The mention of hobbies or interests related to specific subjects, like being a linguistics major with a focus on practical job application, is also not clearly demonstrated in the conversation. Furthermore, relevant details or speaker interactions from the context, like the mutual discussion of teaching or history, are missing.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY is lacking a clear connection and natural progression that would aid in developing a coherent next response within the provided DIALOGUE CONTEXT, hence the low score."
