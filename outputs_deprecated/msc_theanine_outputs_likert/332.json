    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume.\nSpeaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment. \nSpeaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think?\nSpeaker A: It depends on what you are trying to make out of origami, you can make some super complicated stuff, there's actually special paper that you can get for it! You may have seen origami be used in the hospital for some breathing aperatus!\nSpeaker B: That's amazing. I had no idea, but that totally makes sense. Do you have to practice a lot -- sort of a use it or lose it kind of thing?\nSpeaker A: Yea, I think for the more complicated origami it's kind of a use it or lose it but for the simple stuff you can usually take a couple months of and still remember to do it! Did you see origami in Japan?\nSpeaker B: Not up close, but I noticed a lot in shop windows in certain areas. I love Japan -- they're so welcoming. One of our acquaintances GAVE me a kimono. She said it's customary to try to share their culture. Kind of different from America in my opinion.  \nSpeaker A: Oh, that sounds wonderful. It's impressive how much things that came from there and how giving a culture they are. America is definetly a lot different from them, have you visted different states in America?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both like the color turquoise. Speaker B keeps a turquoise lotus origami on their desk from Japan, which causes Speaker A to wish to visit the country where origami was originally created, possibly Japan.\nSpeaker B has visited 20 countries and enjoys the color turquoise, reacting positively to having visited Japan and finding it to be an amazing country.\nSpeaker A, who had a fortunate upbringing and enjoys helping people through volunteer work, caused Speaker B to be recommended volunteering and travel to Japan and Italy, enjoying the art and food. This makes Speaker A want to visit Italy first before going to Japan.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I've been fortunate to have visited quite a few states in America. Each one has its own unique charm and culture, just like different countries do. Have you had the chance to explore many states as well?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some connections to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly regarding origami and Japan. It mentions that Speaker B keeps a turquoise lotus origami on their desk from Japan, which is a direct link to the ongoing conversation about origami and Japan in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the MEMORY includes Speaker B's positive reaction to having visited Japan, which aligns with the conversation where Speaker B discusses their love for Japan and noticing origami in shop windows.\n\nHowever, several parts of the MEMORY do not provide direct assistance in generating the next response. For instance, the affinity for the color turquoise or Speaker A's wish to visit Japan due to the origami on Speaker B's desk is not directly relevant to the current trajectory of the conversation. Moreover, additional details such as Speaker B's 20-country travels and Speaker A's volunteer work are not currently relevant. These tangential facts are structured in a way that isn't particularly helpful for generating responses specific to the highlighted context.\n\nOverall, while the MEMORY contains some relevant information, it also includes unrelated details, slightly reducing its overall helpfulness."
