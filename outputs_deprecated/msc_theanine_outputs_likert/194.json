Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make?\nSpeaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it.\nSpeaker A: I would love to, I enjoy cooking so maybe you can teach me to make it, too?\nSpeaker B: Yeah definitely! I know you like hot foods, so if you learn and can make them fresh it will taste amazing. Have you tried any new foods lately?\nSpeaker A: Not any new foods, but I did try a new food truck near me that was delicious! It was street tacos and you could pick from barbacoa, chicken, and steak for the protein. Do you like Mexican food? \nSpeaker B: Oh god I do love Mexican food. That was be so hard to pick because they're all so good! Did they have al pastor by any chance? I loved marinated pork tacos.\nSpeaker A: unfortunately no, but I can ask them if they plan to get it in the future. I had one of each and they were all good in their own way. Have you ever had Birra tacos? I'd love to try those next.\nSpeaker B: I've never had birra tacos, what are those? They sound intriguing.\nSpeaker A: If I understand it correctly, the tortilla is dipped in the liquid from the braised meat, and then fried on a flat top. Then filled with the meat that was braised and other toppings that you like. I'll let you know if I find a place that serves these tacos in our area!\nSpeaker B: Wow, my mouth is watering. I'll definitely have to try that. It sounds amazing and might be a new favorite. Is it spicy?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally, while Speaker B likes to eat huge steaks after snowboarding.\nSpeaker B enjoys snowboarding, surfing, and skateboarding, and also enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe.\nSpeaker A plays the drums and loves making food for others.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "memory_text": "Speaker A enjoys cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally, while Speaker B likes to eat huge steaks after snowboarding.\nSpeaker B enjoys snowboarding, surfing, and skateboarding, and also enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe.\nSpeaker A plays the drums and loves making food for others.",
    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "Yes, birra tacos can have a bit of a kick to them, depending on how they're seasoned. It's a delicious combination of flavors!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains useful contextual information about Speaker A and Speaker B's interests relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions both speakers' enjoyment of cooking, which ties into their conversation about cooking and trying new foods. Speaker B's appreciation for their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe connects directly to the dialogue where garlic chicken was mentioned. However, the information about Speaker B's recreational activities and eating habits, such as loving huge steaks after snowboarding, is not directly related to the conversation. The MEMORY does not fully capture the dynamic of the current conversation, missing out on more specific details such as their taco discussion or the shared interest in Mexican food. While the MEMORY provides some relevant context, it falls short in clearly demonstrating the development and relevancy of the speakers' interactions in the ongoing dialogue."
