Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens?\nSpeaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys visiting the zoo and has a cat that recently had a kitten. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend.\n2. Speaker A's sister recently got married, which was exciting for them. Speaker B's girlfriend enjoys pandas and penguins at the zoo and they go to the zoo every few weeks. Speaker B wants to get a kitten from Speaker A's friend. Speaker A prefers cockatoos over kittens as pets.\n3. Speaker B enjoys visiting the zoo and has a cat that recently had a kitten. Speaker B's girlfriend owns a cockatoo named John.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a good plan. It's important to make sure you have enough time to settle in the new kitten.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but lacks clear development and connection between sentences. MEMORY sentences mention Speaker B's interest in adopting a kitten and Speaker A's friend's involvement, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about considering a friend's kittens. However, the connection between these facts and the ongoing conversation is not particularly strong. Other sentences about visiting the zoo or owning a cockatoo provide contextual background but aren't directly helpful for generating a next response in the given conversation. Thus, while the MEMORY contains some relevant elements, it could be better structured to highlight the development and causal relationships more clearly."
