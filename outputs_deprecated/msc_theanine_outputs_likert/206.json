Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college?\nSpeaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position. \nSpeaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it?\nSpeaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \nSpeaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living.\nSpeaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime?\nSpeaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with.\nSpeaker A: Sounds great! Now the tough question: when do you have time?\nSpeaker B: It would have to be sometime when I'm off work, maybe on the weekend. \nSpeaker A: OK. Just let me know when you want to plan it and I will put in the reservation request. Do you need to borrow cleats or anything? I am a size 11.5.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket, but now plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week. Additionally, Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments. \nSpeaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United. \nSpeaker A enjoys playing soccer and is studying Humanities in college with the goal of finishing before looking for a job. They are seeking career advice from a guidance counselor and considering options in humanities or teaching.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks for offering! I might need to borrow some cleats, my old ones are probably too small now.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that could be useful for generating the next response. Specifically, it confirms Speaker A's interest in soccer, which aligns with their desire to provide a soccer field reservation and their interest in soccer-related video games mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Similarly, it provides background on Speaker B's soccer experience (playing in college) and their interest in soccer teams like Manchester United, which ties back to their comments about being a goalkeeper and watching games on TV.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY includes additional details about Speaker A's past jobs and academic pursuits that are not directly relevant to continuing the current conversation about playing soccer. While these details are naturally phrased, they don't offer substantial guidance for the immediate continuation of the present dialogue related to arranging a casual soccer match.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful as it contains relevant soccer connections, although it includes some unrelated information. Thus it deserves a moderate score."
