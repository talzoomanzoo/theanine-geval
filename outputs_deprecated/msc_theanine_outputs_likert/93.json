    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing?\nSpeaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from?\nSpeaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there.\nSpeaker B: That's great. I have gotten my pets from the shelter and they seem happy I brought them home. I have a hard time saying no to them which is why I have so many pets. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs. Do you have a name in mind for your cat? \nSpeaker A: I've thought of a lot of  names, but in the end it will probably depend on the breed and the sex.  \nSpeaker B: That's true. Is pilates hard? I've always wanted to try it but I don't know if it will be too difficult.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B's prices for a portrait start at $5000 to pay for college tuition. Speaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals and discovered a love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets. Speaker B thinks pit bulls are lovely and has one that is kind and sweet. Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions.\n\nSpeaker A has a brother and might commission a family portrait from Speaker B. Both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy the company of their pets and think they are smart and playful. Speaker B has 5 dogs of different breeds and has rats as pets but didn't include them in the portrait. Speaker B thinks pit bulls are lovely and has one that is kind and sweet.\n\nSpeaker A has a brother and might commission a family portrait from Speaker B.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information about Speaker B's interest in pets and portraits, which partially connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about painting portraits and pets. However, a significant portion of the MEMORY is not directly related to the ongoing conversation and lacks coherence in terms of relevancy or causality. For instance, the fact that Speaker B's portrait prices start at $5000 or that Speaker A has a brother who might commission a portrait are details that don't contribute much to the immediate dialogue. Additionally, the MEMORY is somewhat repetitive and disjointed, with certain pieces of information repeated twice and others abruptly introduced without clear ties to previously established dialog. This structure makes it challenging for the language model to extract useful contextual cues for generating the next response."
