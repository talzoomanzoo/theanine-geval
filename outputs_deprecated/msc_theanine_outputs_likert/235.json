Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet? \nSpeaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name?\nSpeaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \nSpeaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along!\nSpeaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them.\nSpeaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me!\nSpeaker A: Hahaha. Yes I agree its too hot to get a long hike in. I've been on some short ones, but the bugs eat me alive. I like to hike in the fall when the bugs are dying off and its a little cooler.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a pet parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten. \nSpeaker A is a country girl who loves animals and is considering adopting a rescue kitten. \nSpeaker B lives in the city they grew up in, loves animals, and has a cat that recently had a kitten.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I totally get that! Fall hikes are the best, no bugs and cooler temperatures. It's my favorite time of year to hit the trails too.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information that would aid in generating a continuation for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Here's why:\n\n1. The MEMORY includes the fact that Speaker A has a pet parrot named Tasha who might interact with new rescue animals, enriching the context and providing causality for A's statements about Tasha's interactions with other animals (cats).\n   \n2. The mention of Speaker A being a country girl who loves animals adds depth to the dialogue context by explaining A's interest in both hiking and animal adoption.\n\n3. The detail about Speaker B living in the city they grew up in is not directly relevant to the current dialogue context but does help establish background for B as someone familiar with urban settings, potentially influencing their perspective on hiking or pet adoption.\n\n4. Lastly, Speaker B's cat recently having a kitten is essential because it ties directly to the discussion about kittens between A and B, confirming that B has a personal connection to kittens, hence the inspiration behind considering names like \"Oreo.\"\n\nThe MEMORY effectively supports the dialogue, allowing for an understanding of prior events and current topics, with related additional information phrased easily for identification by the model. Improvements could be made if the information about Speaker B's city background was directly linked to the dialogue context."
