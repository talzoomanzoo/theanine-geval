    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read.\nSpeaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting? \nSpeaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys spending time with her 8 grandchildren, who are now old enough to entertain themselves with technology or TV. This allows Speaker A to suggest taking naps during quiet times.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Sounds like a thrilling read! Sometimes a good book can be just as entertaining as spending time with the grandkids.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some contextual information about Speaker A that could loosely relate to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It explains that Speaker A enjoys spending time with her grandchildren and that they are old enough to entertain themselves, which is why she didn't watch them today, thus allowing her to read a book. However, the connection between the MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is not explicitly clear or directly relevant. It predominantly focuses on Speaker A's family life rather than her book-reading habits or interests, which are more pertinent to the current conversation. The MEMORY does not contain naturally connected sentences that offer a clear development or causality directly related to the book discussion. Therefore, it only minimally helps in generating a proper response in context, resulting in a score of 2."
