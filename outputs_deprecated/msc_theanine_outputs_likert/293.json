    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \nSpeaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with?\nSpeaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point.\nSpeaker A: Yes, it contains eggs.  I think you would do well with the fried rice. It's best to cook the rice the day before.  \nSpeaker B: I didn't know that. Why cook the rice beforehand? Is it better to age rice or something?\nSpeaker A: The rice needs to be cool before adding to the pan.  Are you able to take a passenger along in you truck?\nSpeaker B: Oh! That makes since. I didn't realize that the temperature made a difference when frying rice. As for the truck, Yes I can. But, depending on what company I'm working for at the time, they often set restrictions on passengers.\nSpeaker A: The rice tends to stick together if it's warm.  I would like to ride along with you sometime when you're able.\nSpeaker B: I actually have a scheduled haul for next Wednesday. Do you want to come along for that ride? It should take about five hours.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B lives in a rural area with a farm and can relate to cooking. This allows Speaker B to easily understand the cooking process and ingredients. Speaker A bakes muffins and bread but is conscious of their impact on their weight, showing a consideration for healthy eating habits. Speaker A is interested in running a business with their cooking skills, indicating a potential entrepreneurial spirit. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker, showing a willingness to explore new culinary techniques. \n\nSpeaker A is from the south of India and prefers warm summer weather, influencing their cooking preferences towards Indian cuisine and rice dishes. Speaker A primarily cooks Indian food and bakes a lot of rice dishes, showcasing their culinary expertise in these specific areas. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken, highlighting their diverse cooking skills and preferences.\n\nSpeaker B does not cook, but enjoys listening to country music and drives trucks for a living. This contrasts with Speaker B's husband, who is a skilled cook specializing in Asian cuisine with extensive prep work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Firstly, it offers insight into Speaker B's background, such as living in a rural area with a farm and the inclination towards learning cooking, which correlates with the dialogue where Speaker B is interested in trying beginner recipes. Additionally, the MEMORY explains Speaker B's lack of cooking experience but interest in learning pressure cooking, which aligns with the current context of learning to cook fried rice. Furthermore, it mentions Speaker B's husband's cooking skills, which might give context to why Speaker B is learning to cook Asian cuisine, though this isn't directly mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor Speaker A, it notes their expertise in rice dishes and preference for Indian cuisine, relevant to suggesting fried rice in the dialogue. However, the MEMORY includes some facts, like Speaker A's preference for warm weather and interest in running a cooking business, which are not particularly relevant to the ongoing dialogue context.\n\nOverall, while MEMORY provides useful details that partially inform the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, it also includes some extraneous information that does not aid in generating a next response in the dialogue. Therefore, the MEMORY is moderately helpful, warranting a score of 3."
