Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know. \nSpeaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like.\nSpeaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too.\nSpeaker B: Nice! Is anyone coming with you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys Mexican food and drinks, and plays music for fun. This leads Speaker A to frequent live band venues and play music at home. Additionally, Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy bluegrass music.\n\n2. Speaker A owns a Subaru Legacy and mentions having a baby on the way, causing Speaker B's wife to be pregnant and currently in the second trimester while still working. Speaker B's wife being pregnant makes them want to consider attending a local festival for just a day. In the same vein, Speaker A is unsure if they will ever settle down with a partner and have kids.\n\n3. Speaker A enjoying Mexican food and drinks, and playing music for fun, causes Speaker B to feel a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy. This leads to Speaker A and Speaker B discussing the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "I might just go solo this time, enjoy some music and good food on my own.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it notes that Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy bluegrass music, which ties into the dialogue about attending a Bluegrass show. Additionally, it provides context about Speaker B's wife's pregnancy, which can explain the decision to consider using a cabin instead of camping, potentially offering a more comfortable option. However, the MEMORY also contains some information that is less directly relevant, such as Speaker A's personal interests in Mexican food and drinks, and a Subaru Legacy, which do not contribute significantly to generating a response in the current dialogue context. The MEMORY could be structured more cohesively to highlight the connection and development of these points, enhancing its overall helpfulness for generating the next response."
