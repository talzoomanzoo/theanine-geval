Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \nSpeaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with?\nSpeaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys cooking and baking, possibly considering turning it into a business. This passion is reflected in the way Speaker A primarily cooks Indian food and bakes a lot of rice dishes. Speaker B's husband, who is an avid cook specializing in Asian cuisine with extensive prep work, might find common ground with Speaker A. \nLiving in a rural area with a farm, Speaker B's lifestyle resonates with Speaker A's interest in converting their culinary skills into a business. Speaker B, not a cook, is intrigued by cooking with a pressure cooker, sparking an interest in Speaker A. \nBoth Speaker A and Speaker B share a love for farm life, with Speaker A owning a farm and indulging in cooking and baking. This connection leads Speaker A to explore using a pressure cooker for recipes such as dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great idea! Shrimp fried rice seems like a delicious and easy recipe to begin with. I'll definitely give it a try. Thanks for the suggestion!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant background information that helps understand the dynamics between Speaker A and Speaker B. It highlights Speaker A's passion for cooking and baking, particularly Indian food, and their potential interest in starting a business, which ties into their suggestion of recipes. Speaker B's husband's interest in Asian cuisine and their rural lifestyle with a farm are relevant, as they connect specifically to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT involving recipe suggestions related to Asian food. However, the MEMORY contains several additional details that are not directly relevant to the immediate context of discussing beginner recipes or using a pressure cooker. The mentioning of specific dishes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken could be more explicitly connected to the context to enhance helpfulness. While the MEMORY captures the general interests of both speakers, it lacks a clearer development of how their shared interests directly lead to the current exchange. Thus, it is somewhat helpful but not perfectly aligned or succinct."
