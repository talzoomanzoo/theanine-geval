Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself!\nSpeaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food?\nSpeaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too?\nSpeaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also?\nSpeaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys working with animals and has penguins at the zoo. Speaker B is excited about the opportunity at the zoo and is looking for a new job. Speaker B has elderly terriers and is planning to leave their part-time job for a break before starting a new one.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "They're doing okay, just getting older. I'm really looking forward to starting a new job at the zoo, it will be a nice change of pace.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some minimal context about Speaker B's circumstances, specifically about their job situation and their dogs. However, this information is not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on the speakers' pets and their habits related to food. The mention of Speaker B's elderly terriers could have some tangential relevance to the conversation about dogs and food, but it doesn't provide any development or connection that directly aids in generating a response to the current dialogue. Additionally, the information about Speaker A working with animals and penguins at the zoo is unrelated to the present discussion, which revolves around domestic pets (dogs) and their behavior regarding food. As a result, the MEMORY lacks the helpfulness and relevancy needed to support the continuation of the current conversation effectively."
