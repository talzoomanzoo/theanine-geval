Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys being outside and reading Star Wars novels. Speaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian. Speaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five. Speaker B and their kids are excited about their upcoming trip to Greece. Both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy reading and are librarians.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's fantastic! The Acropolis is an iconic historical site in Athens with breathtaking views. You'll love exploring it.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides limited information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While it does mention Speaker B's excitement about visiting Greece and some timing for the trip, it lacks detailed information or past interactions between the speakers that could help generate a response about the Acropolis in Athens. The MEMORY contains some repetitive and unrelated information about Speaker Bâ€™s personal interests and background, like reading Star Wars novels and being a librarian, which are not directly beneficial for the context at hand. Overall, the MEMORY lacks natural connections or phrasings that would clearly help in generating a response regarding the Acropolis."
