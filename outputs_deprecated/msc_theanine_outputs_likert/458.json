    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue.\nSpeaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad.\nSpeaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs!\nSpeaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours?\nSpeaker A: Ikea! Their furniture is not to expensive and they have all kinds of furniture that'll go with whatever scheme you're going for. What kind of patio furniture were you looking for? Like a barbeque, chairs, hammock? \nSpeaker B: I guess I was going to get like an umbrella table and some chairs to go with it or maybe even a screened in gazebo with a fire pit in the middle.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is in the process of renovating their house to meet their living standards with their pets. Speaker A suggests ways to incorporate the purple sofas into the existing light green paint in the room. Speaker A is looking to redecorate their house and likes purple furniture. Speaker A recently bought new furniture for their house, including a couch, recliner, and patio furniture.\n\nSpeaker B is in the process of renovating their house to meet their living standards with their pets. Speaker B is considering adding more colorful elements to the room to make the purple sofas work. Speaker A is looking to redecorate their house and likes purple furniture. Speaker A recently bought new furniture for their house, including a couch, recliner, and patio furniture.\n\nSpeaker B is looking for furniture shop to buy furniture, has two dogs, and works near a mall. Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing furniture and home decor choices. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to meet up to discuss the furniture exchange. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "A screened-in gazebo with a fire pit sounds like a cozy idea! That would be perfect for those summer evenings. Ikea has some great options for outdoor furniture, so you might find something that fits your color scheme there too.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It emphasizes Speaker B's current renovation and furniture needs as well as Speaker A's knowledge and recent purchase of furniture, which could be useful context for generating a future response regarding the furniture discussion. However, the detailed mention of Speaker B's pets and other unrelated details may not be directly beneficial to generating a response based on the given dialogue. The sentences repeat information and lack connection, which partially reduces the MEMORY's helpfulness. More concise and specifically relevant information would improve its score."
