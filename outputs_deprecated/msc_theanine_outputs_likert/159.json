Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it!\nSpeaker B: I'm glad you liked it. My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to?\nSpeaker A: I recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca. It was super cute and made me want to go visit Italy, but that was too expensive, so instead I booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month. What about you?\nSpeaker B: I have been relaxing with the kids as much as I have. My husband has been busy with work, so we haven't had time for anything big. I would love to visit Italy some day though if we get the chance. Have you ever been to Italy before?\nSpeaker A: I have never gone to Italy because I'm always so busy. If I ever go, I would want to spend a month there, but work has been hectic lately. Would your kids go with you if you went to Italy?\nSpeaker B: Absolutely! I'd love to travel all over the world with my family to see everything. Hawaii sounds like just as much fun though. What are you most excited about doing when you get there?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A recently watched the Disney movie 'Luca' and found it super cute, which made them want to visit Italy.\nSpeaker B used to enjoy watching movies with her kids, but now prefers romance and horror movies. However, their kids really enjoyed watching 'Luca' and thought it was good.\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both enjoy sunsets and movies, with Speaker A preferring the beach for watching sunsets. Speaker A has booked a \"Hawaii Sunset\" tour for next month and is excited about it being their first time.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm most excited about watching the beautiful sunsets on the beach in Hawaii. It's going to be a magical experience.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe memory provides helpful information regarding the topics discussed in the dialogue context, which revolves primarily around movies and travel plans. It captures the key details such as Speaker A recently watching \"Luca\" and wanting to visit Italy and scheduling a Hawaii sunset tour, which aligns with the current conversation. It also provides insight into Speaker B's movie preferences and their enjoyment of sunsets, albeit with a note that their current preference is for romance and horror movies. This might slightly contradict the context where Speaker B mentions enjoying \"Miracle.\" Despite this, the memory reflects the general theme discussed and the engagement of both speakers in conversations about family enjoyment, movies, and travel plans. It is structured well enough for a language model to generate a relevant next response, though the notes on movie preferences might create some confusion without further context."
