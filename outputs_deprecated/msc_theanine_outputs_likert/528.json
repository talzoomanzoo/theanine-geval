Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer?\nSpeaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to?\nSpeaker A: The museum has all sorts of galleries.  It has a sculpture garden outside.  I mostly like the impressionist paintings.  I like Van Gogh.  Was your concert outdoors?\nSpeaker B: Yes. That way they could have a fireworks show too. I love fireworks. Have you ever seen the fireworks at the Disney castle?\nSpeaker A: No, but I have been to Disney World in Florida.  I love fireworks too.  I want to get married on the 4th of July.  That was we will have a national holiday and fireworks for us every year!  It sounds like you've been to Disneyland?\nSpeaker B: No, but I thought you might have since you lived in LA for awhile. Did you get to see any live Disney music performances while you were at Disney World?\nSpeaker A: No, we rode a lot of rides that broke down.  We had to be rescued from the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.  It was stuck.  Someone put on waders and pushed us to the side to climb out.\nSpeaker B: Oh no! Hopefully your trip to the art museum is much better than that. Did your boyfriend go to Disney World too?\nSpeaker A: No, I had a cousin that I went with.  We stayed in a hotel in Miami too and I got so sunburned on the beach!  I'm sure the art museum will be good if it isn't too crowded.  Was your concert crowded?\nSpeaker B: It was so crowded, but my older brothers went with me and kept me from getting squished. Make sure you wear sunscreen when you visit the beach this time!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys going to museums and trying different foods. They plan to do lots of shopping during their trip.\nSpeaker B is waiting for bands to announce their summer tour schedule to plan which shows to attend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks for the reminder! I'll definitely remember the sunscreen this time. I hope the concert was worth the crowd.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided has limited helpfulness in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While it contains some relevant information about Speaker A's interests in going to museums, it lacks specific details directly related to the current conversation. The MEMORY does not mention any interest in fireworks or concerts, which are significant topics in the dialogue. Similarly, the mention of Speaker A's plan for shopping doesn't tie into the current context, and details about Speaker B's summer concerts are only vaguely related. The sentences lack a natural structure that demonstrates the development or causality of past interactions, making it challenging for the language model to utilize this information effectively for generating the next response. It provides some context about their interests but fails to cohesively connect to the ongoing conversation."
