Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me?\nSpeaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week?\nSpeaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day\nSpeaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A plans to retire down south on a beach for warm weather. Speaker B is interested in visiting Alaska and mentions getting blackout curtains due to the midnight sun. Speaker B found flights that work for their schedule and price and will be visiting Speaker A in a couple of weeks. Speaker A has invited Speaker B to visit them and is excited about the trip. Speaker A plans to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "There's actually a folk concert happening next weekend that I was thinking of going to. It would be great if you could make it for that!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides useful information for Speaker A to generate their next response. It includes relevant details such as Speaker B having found flights within their schedule and price, and that they will be visiting Speaker A in a couple of weeks. This information is directly helpful in responding to Speaker B's query about planning the visit around concerts. Additionally, the memory mentions Speaker A's excitement about the visit, which helps in shaping an enthusiastic and welcoming response. However, some details, like Speaker B's interest in visiting Alaska and getting blackout curtains, are not directly relevant to the current dialogue context, but they don't hinder the clarity or structure of the helpful details."
