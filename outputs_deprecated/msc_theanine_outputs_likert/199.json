Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college?\nSpeaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position. \nSpeaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it?\nSpeaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket but is now a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments. \nSpeaker A joked about treating Speaker B to lunch, indicating Speaker B is currently low on cash, and Speaker B is considering asking for a raise at work as a clerk for a law firm and enjoys the work but wishes it paid better.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some background information about Speaker A and Speaker B that is relevant to their current dialogue, such as their connection to soccer. However, it does not clearly relate to the specific discussion about the position Speaker B played or the feelings associated with missing playing soccer. The information about Speaker B's financial situation and job as a clerk at a law firm is not directly relevant to the current conversation and doesn't help generate the next response. Additionally, the sentence about Speaker A's past job at a supermarket is not clearly connected to the dialogue. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it contained information that directly relates to the emotions or experiences discussed in the current conversation."
