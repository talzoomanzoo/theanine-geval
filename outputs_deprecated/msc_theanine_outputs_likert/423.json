Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is working on becoming an Eagle Scout and volunteers at a research lab. Speaker A is scared of sharks but finds the idea of going into a steel cage with them interesting. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies. Speaker A does not have any pets and expresses an interest in scuba diving. \n\nSpeaker B is a veteran and knows of Eagle Scout projects for veterans, including one that helps dispose of American flags correctly. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies. \n\nSpeaker A is working on becoming an Eagle Scout and volunteers at a research lab. Speaker A does not have any pets and expresses an interest in scuba diving. Speaker B has an interest in diving and is planning to take neuroscience classes using the GI Bill. Speaker B is a veteran who went to the army after high school, interested in neuroscience and seeking advice on studying it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I bet Hansel and Gretel are keeping you entertained!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information about Speaker B's pet snakes, which directly relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT of inquiring about \"pet snakes.\" However, the MEMORY is cluttered with repetitive and somewhat disorganized information about Speaker A's and Speaker B's interests and backgrounds, which are not directly useful for generating a response to the current question about the snakes. \n\nNonetheless, it does provide some context about Speaker B's preference for animals over humans, which might subtly enrich the response generation. The issue lies in the repetition and scattered distribution of information, making it less efficient for the language model to pinpoint and synthesize the most relevant details for the immediate conversation topic. Removing redundant information would improve the MEMORY's helpfulness score."
