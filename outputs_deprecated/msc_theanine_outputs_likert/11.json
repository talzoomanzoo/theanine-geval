Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys watching swimming movies and wants to listen to punk music while swimming and learning programming.\nSpeaker B is looking forward to eating a pizza burger in a pool with punk music playing. \nSpeaker A enjoys cruising in their car while listening to punk music. Speaker A enjoys the food and the adventure of cruises and wants to discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together with Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that could help generate a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it mentions Speaker B's interest in listening to punk music while swimming and learning programming, which directly relates to Speaker A's creation of a playlist that includes punk music for those activities. However, the MEMORY also includes details about Speaker B's interest in eating a pizza burger in a pool and Speaker A's enjoyment of cruising and wanting to discuss a cruise ship adventure, which are not directly connected to the current discussion of the meetup and playlist creation. Although the MEMORY has some relevant points, the extra information about cruising might not be immediately useful for generating a response based on the provided context. The sentences are phrased naturally, but the connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT could be stronger to score higher."
