Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing?\nSpeaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from?\nSpeaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there.\nSpeaker B: That's great. I have gotten my pets from the shelter and they seem happy I brought them home. I have a hard time saying no to them which is why I have so many pets. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs. Do you have a name in mind for your cat? \nSpeaker A: I've thought of a lot of  names, but in the end it will probably depend on the breed and the sex.  \nSpeaker B: That's true. Is pilates hard? I've always wanted to try it but I don't know if it will be too difficult.\nSpeaker A: No, I don't think it's hard.  I actually enjoy it.  It's more fun than work, at least to me. You should give it a try!\nSpeaker B: Maybe I will. Do you think I can start at home by watching Youtube videos, or do I need to go to a Pilates class?\nSpeaker A: You can probably start with Youtube just to see if you like it.  Much better to go to a class I think though.  Of course, I'm biased. I'm in love with my instructor! haha\n\nMEMORY:\n- Speaker B's prices for a portrait start at $5000 to pay for college tuition. Speaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals and discovered a love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets. Speaker B thinks pit bulls are lovely and has one that is kind and sweet. Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions. \n- Speaker B is in college, paints on the side, and has five dogs and three rats. Speaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals and discovered a love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets. Speaker B thinks pit bulls are lovely and has one that is kind and sweet. Speaker A prefers adopting pets from shelters rather than from breeders.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Haha, having a great instructor definitely makes a difference! I'll give it a try at home first and see how it goes. Thanks for the advice!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information about Speaker B, particularly their background in painting and their interest in pets, which can be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where they discuss painting a portrait and owning pets. However, the MEMORY could be structured more effectively to clearly connect past interactions and provide cues to generate the next response. The repetition of certain details (e.g., \"Speaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals\") reduces the potential helpfulness of the MEMORY. Overall, while there is relevant information, the organization and phrasing could be improved for better clarity and contextual connection."
