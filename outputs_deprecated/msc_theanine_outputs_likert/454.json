Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue.\nSpeaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is looking for furniture shop to buy furniture, has two dogs, and works near a mall. Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing furniture and home decor choices. This causes Speaker A and Speaker B to plan to meet up to discuss the furniture exchange. Speaker A has devices to keep bugs away and offers to share the product names with Speaker B.\n\nSpeaker A's favorite season is winter and enjoys the country lifestyle. Speaker B plans to grill steaks this weekend and prefers using an old charcoal grill over a gas one. This makes Speaker A look forward to spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights.\n\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both enjoy barbecuing and have a love for pets. They are discussing furniture and home decor choices, leading to a plan to meet up to discuss the furniture exchange. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'd be happy to help you choose a color scheme! And don't worry, I'll bring along that bug spray to keep those mosquitoes away during our outdoor barbecue.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The mention of Speaker A learning to play the guitar and planning to play something at the barbecue is indirectly related to Speaker A's enjoyment of music nights mentioned in the MEMORY. Additionally, the MEMORY note that Speaker B plans to grill steaks and discusses barbecue-related activities connects to the barbecue event mentioned in DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY also contains several details that seem less relevant to the immediate conversation, such as specifics about Speaker B's living arrangements, their preference for charcoal grills, and Speaker A's favorite season and lifestyle preferences. While these details are naturally phrased, they don't clearly contribute to the ongoing dialogue or aid in generating a direct response based on the context provided.\n\nThus, the MEMORY sits in the middle range for helpfulness, providing some relevant cues but also including information that might not be necessary for the immediate conversation development."
