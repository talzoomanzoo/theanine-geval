    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make?\nSpeaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it.\nSpeaker A: I would love to, I enjoy cooking so maybe you can teach me to make it, too?\nSpeaker B: Yeah definitely! I know you like hot foods, so if you learn and can make them fresh it will taste amazing. Have you tried any new foods lately?\nSpeaker A: Not any new foods, but I did try a new food truck near me that was delicious! It was street tacos and you could pick from barbacoa, chicken, and steak for the protein. Do you like Mexican food? \nSpeaker B: Oh god I do love Mexican food. That was be so hard to pick because they're all so good! Did they have al pastor by any chance? I loved marinated pork tacos.\nSpeaker A: unfortunately no, but I can ask them if they plan to get it in the future. I had one of each and they were all good in their own way. Have you ever had Birra tacos? I'd love to try those next.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe. This reminds them of the good old days.\n- Speaker A wakes up early in the morning to catch waves, while Speaker B likes to eat huge steaks after snowboarding. They both have different routines but share a love for specific activities.\n- Speaker B's grandmother was the matriarch of the family, known for cooking large meals for family gatherings. This is why Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones.\n- Speaker A is part of a music band and plays the drums, and also loves making food for others.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I haven't tried Birra tacos before, but they sound intriguing! I'll have to look for a recipe and make them for you next time you come over. What other types of cuisines do you enjoy?",
    "prediction": "3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information helpful for generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it does not effectively identify and emphasize these connections. Speaker B's passion for cooking and their grandmotherâ€™s garlic chicken as a cherished recipe are indeed mentioned in the context, making this memory partially helpful. However, the rest of MEMORY contains information not directly related to the current context (e.g., Speaker A's music band and different routines), although naturally phrased, they do not enhance understanding of the interaction in the dialogue. Therefore, while MEMORY possesses elements of connection and development, it lacks a more robust linkage to the current dialogue to warrant a higher rating."
