Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume.\nSpeaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment. \nSpeaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think?\nSpeaker A: It depends on what you are trying to make out of origami, you can make some super complicated stuff, there's actually special paper that you can get for it! You may have seen origami be used in the hospital for some breathing aperatus!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys art and music, specifically painting. They are currently working on painting projects in their craft room. Additionally, Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next. They enjoy origami and have successfully tried making a Lotus flower. \nSpeaker A finds meaning and fulfillment in doing volunteer work. This led them to be busy with gardening and volunteering at the hospital. Their volunteering experience inspired them to start making origami crafts, specifically a 3D modular swan with glue. Speaker A also learned origami by themselves in their craft room. \nSpeaker A, who enjoys art and music, specifically painting, is currently working on painting projects in their craft room. They are interested in trying to make a lotus origami next and have offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's interesting, I didn't know origami could be used in the hospital for breathing apparatus. It definitely seems like there's a lot more to origami than meets the eye!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for Speaker B to generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It offers relevant details about Speaker A's interest in art, music, and specifically origami, which aligns with the conversation about Speaker A's accomplishment in an origami contest. The MEMORY mentions Speaker A's proficiency in origami, their plans to attempt making a lotus origami, and their experience with origami in a hospital setting. This information is naturally structured and demonstrates the development of Speaker A's interests and activities, which can guide Speaker B in formulating an informed and meaningful response. However, some sentences are repeated or not directly linked to the immediate context of the conversation, which slightly reduces the overall coherence and relevance. Despite this, the MEMORY still provides a solid foundation for a language model to generate appropriate responses, earning it a score of 4."
