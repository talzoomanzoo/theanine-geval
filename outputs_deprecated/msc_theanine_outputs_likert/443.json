Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast.\nSpeaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is planning to take summer courses soon and is very active, enjoying martial arts. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts. \nSpeaker A is enrolled in a class on the history of martial arts and is majoring in athletic training. Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class and enjoys it. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts. \nSpeaker A is planning to take summer courses soon and is very active, enjoying martial arts. Speaker B is busy debugging software and is a runner. Speaker A and Speaker B have not booked any holidays recently.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "There were quite a few students today, it was a full class.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically about Speaker A's interest in martial arts and Speaker B's involvement in software work. These details align with the context where Speaker A mentions attending a martial arts class and Speaker B mentions working on a project. However, the MEMORY contains redundancy, as information about Speaker A's interest in martial arts and Speaker B's involvement in software work and history of martial arts is repeated multiple times without additional development or new insights.\n\nThe MEMORY also includes details that are not directly related to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A planning to take summer courses and Speaker B being a runner. While these sentences are naturally phrased, they do not provide helpful information for the language model to generate the next response in the specific context of the conversation.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY has relevant and naturally structured information, but the repetition and inclusion of less relevant details slightly reduce its helpfulness. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate."
