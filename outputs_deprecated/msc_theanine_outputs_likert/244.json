Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not!\nSpeaker B: Have you been hiking lately?\nSpeaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me.\nSpeaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway?\nSpeaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day! I'll make it as fun as possible.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks. This includes camping and hiking as free activities, which Speaker B is not into as much, preferring cruises. Speaker A recently led friends on a hike and enjoyed it, while Speaker B went on a long hike and liked it. Speaker A is looking forward to a 10-day hike on the Appalachian Trail.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate the offer, but I think I'll stick to my cruises for now. Sounds like you had a great time though!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response in the context of the current dialogue. It emphasizes that Speaker A is enthusiastic about outdoor activities like camping and hiking, aligning with the dialogue where Speaker A mentions leading friends on a hike. It also notes that Speaker B is generally less enthusiastic about outdoor activities, preferring cruises, which connects to the dialogue where Speaker B refers to themselves as not being a fan of the outdoors. Additionally, the MEMORY mentions Speaker A's future plans for a long hike, indicating a continued interest in such activities. \n\nHowever, there is some incorrect information in the MEMORY, such as the statement that Speaker B went on a long hike and liked it, which is not supported by the dialogue context. Overall, the MEMORY is mostly relevant and structured in a coherent manner, allowing the model to infer useful contextual cues related to the dialogue context."
