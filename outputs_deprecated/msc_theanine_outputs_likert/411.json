    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read.\nSpeaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting? \nSpeaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far.\nSpeaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes. \nSpeaker A: why don't you like books like that?\nSpeaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading?\nSpeaker A: Not yet.  I think Netflix is going to make it into a movie soon.  They might finally convince me to pay for a subscription haha.\nSpeaker B: Well if it's any good I know you'll be watching the whole thing.\nSpeaker A: you know it.  And I know that you would just fall asleep during it whether it's any good or not.\nSpeaker B: Is there a lot of violence in your book? I couldn't stand to read it if there was. \nSpeaker A: There's a little bit.  Mostly just when describing how the crimes occurred though.  There are also some fight scenes between the cops and the criminals.  It's not too bad.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys reading books about animals. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n2. Speaker B has a son and enjoys reading books about animals. Speaker B is looking forward to having more time to themselves once their son starts preschool next year. Speaker B wants to volunteer at an animal shelter when her son starts school.\n3. Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix. Speaker B is a mother to a son who is going to start going to school soon, which causes Speaker B to plan to buy school supplies and check local stores or order online.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information that could be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it notes that Speaker B enjoys reading books about animals, which aligns with the dialogue when Speaker B expresses their preference for these types of books over crime dramas. Additionally, the part about Speaker A enjoying Netflix is tangentially related to their conversation about Netflix possibly turning the book into a movie. However, the MEMORY also includes other information, such as Speaker B's family and future plans, which is not relevant to the conversation. The sentences are somewhat naturally structured, but the connection between them lacks clear development or causality that would aid further dialogue. Thus, MEMORY has some helpful components but is not fully optimized for the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
