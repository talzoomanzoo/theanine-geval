Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok? \nSpeaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule, which causes Speaker A to enjoy the interaction with people at work and the variety of experiences that come with it.\n\n2. Speaker A owns a restaurant and recently experienced a fire incident but managed to put it out, leading to Speaker A finding it very busy working there. Additionally, Speaker A works at the restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n\n3. Speaker A's restaurant plays a mix of songs, mainly easy listening, to create a relaxing environment for diners, which is why Speaker A's schedule at the restaurant includes working doubles on Saturdays and 8-hour shifts on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information about Speaker A's work life which could be useful for generating a response related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly the fact that Speaker A works at a restaurant and enjoys their work despite the busy schedule. This background can help understand why Speaker A might be excited about the new dish added to the menu. However, the MEMORY delves into details that don't directly connect or enhance the current dialogue context, such as the fire incident at the restaurant, the music played, and the specifics of Speaker A's work schedule. While these details are phrased in a naturally connected manner, they aren't directly relevant to the current topic about the new dish and Speaker A sending a picture to Speaker B. Therefore, the MEMORY provides basic helpful context but lacks direct relevance to the specific dialogue context."
