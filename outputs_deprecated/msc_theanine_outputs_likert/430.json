Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing?\nSpeaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha!\nSpeaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes?\nSpeaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe. \nSpeaker A: You make them sounds so fascinating. Will you take them with you to your college dorm? \nSpeaker B: I'll be living off campus, so absolutely. How about you? Are you staying in the dorms?\nSpeaker A: I'm glad your taking them with you. My mum wants me to stay in dorms. But I think I just want my own place, less drama and more freedom that way.\nSpeaker B: Yup. My parents wanted me to do the same thing...for \"that experience\". To be honest, I don't want it. It'd just be a distraction! \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is working on becoming an Eagle Scout and volunteers at a research lab. Speaker A plans to work with humans in neuroscience to help cure neurological diseases. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n\nSpeaker A is working on becoming an Eagle Scout and volunteers at a research lab. Speaker B is excited about taking neuroscience classes next year. Speaker B's classes related to neuroscience will start next year.\n\nSpeaker B is a veteran and knows of Eagle Scout projects for veterans, including one that helps dispose of American flags correctly. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I totally get that. Sometimes it's better to have your own space for focus and independence.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some useful context that can contribute to generating a relevant and effective response for Speaker A in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it mentions Speaker B's two pet snakes, Hansel and Gretel, which ties in with the conversation about Speaker B's snakes. However, the repetitions of similar information and details about the interests and activities of Speaker A and Speaker B, such as neuroscience classes, Eagle Scout goals, and volunteering in a lab, may not be directly relevant to this specific dialogue context. While these details help sketch out the background of the speakers and hint at shared interests, they do not directly influence the ongoing conversation about staying off-campus or the decision regarding dorm living. The memory includes elements of the speakers' past interactions or personas, which could be indirectly useful for crafting future dialogue, but lacks clear connections to the immediate subjects being discussed in this context. The STRUCTURED nature of how the details are presented makes it moderately helpful, which justifies a middle score."
