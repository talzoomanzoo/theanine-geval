Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is very active, enjoying martial arts and is planning to take summer courses soon. Speaker A has never been out of the United States and thinks it would be nice to visit England. Speaker B enjoys visiting local restaurants in London. Speaker A is interested in trying new restaurants, mentioning Taco Bell as their favorite.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information about Speaker A's interest in martial arts, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A mentions attending a martial arts class. This establishes some context for the conversation. Additionally, MEMORY provides information on Speaker A's activity level and plans, which could potentially be relevant for extending the dialogue. However, parts of the MEMORY, like Speaker B's restaurant preference in London or Speaker A's favorite restaurant being Taco Bell, are not directly relevant to the current context of martial arts, and there's no strong connection or development between these points and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While the information is structured clearly, its direct benefit for generating a response based on the context is moderate, resulting in a mid-level score."
