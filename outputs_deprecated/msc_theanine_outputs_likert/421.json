Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin!\nSpeaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name? \nSpeaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls! \nSpeaker B: I see what you meant. Plus the color is beautiful orange. I want to see them together, even I am not a cat person they must be cute together at that time. Once the kitten grows up, situation gonna change to me. How are they, they are doing well?\nSpeaker A: Marmalade is orange too but this is better because the baby is sassy and climbs up my leg to sit on my shoulder. I don't understand how you are not a cat person when you have such a large heart for stray kittens.\nSpeaker B: hehe you're right. But i can't explain that why I am not a cat person to you sorry. How's the weather like today, still good weather to have iced tea out there?\nSpeaker A: It's beautiful. I'm sitting outside while the Spice Girls are chasing bugs in the grass. What did your kids name your cats?\nSpeaker B: ohh so nice sounds like you are enjoying the weather. Still we are discussing about that. Did not name them yet. Also I want to put them back since I am not a big fan of cat\nSpeaker A: That would be cruel to do. You need to rehome them properly or otherwise someone may report you to the authorities for animal abuse. My heart is breaking for your poor cats. \nSpeaker B: Thank you for concerning. I am trying to be nice to them do not worry \n\nMEMORY:\n1. [Speaker A drives a Mini Cooper and recently visited a hair salon.] - (Changed) - [Speaker A has a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Marmalade.] - (Want) - [Speaker A wants to take the Spice Girls on a road trip in the Subaru.]\n\n2. [Speaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten.] - (React) - [Speaker A has a kitten from their cat and enjoys taking them on trips.] - (Want) - [Speaker A wants to take the Spice Girls on a road trip in the Subaru.]\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The memory contains some relevant information that helps in understanding the context and development of the dialogue. For instance, it mentions Speaker A's kitten and the name Marmalade, which connects to the ongoing dialogue about the kitten's name change to Pumpkin. It also touches on Speaker A's affection for taking their cats, referred to as the Spice Girls, on road trips, aligning with the dialogue where Speaker A talks about their love for Pumpkin spice and the Spice Girls chasing bugs together. However, there are elements that are less relevant, such as Speaker A driving a Subaru and wanting to take the Spice Girls on a road trip, which doesn't directly contribute to generating the next response in the given dialogue context. The memory could be more helpful if it presented more focused and cohesive information directly related to the dialogue's central theme about Speaker A's cats and their connection with Speaker B."
