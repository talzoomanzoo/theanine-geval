Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\nSpeaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call!\nSpeaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is a librarian and loves kids, mentioning having 3 children. This leads to Speaker B mentioning having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park. Speaker A's other children are addicted to tablets and phones, unlike the youngest one who is interested in music. Speaker B has grandkids who are more interested in phones and tablets than musical instruments. Speaker A has children and grandchildren, with at least one child interested in learning the flute.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains useful information regarding the background of Speaker A and Speaker B. It reveals aspects of their personal lives and how they relate to the current dialogue context, specifically regarding technology use and family interactions. \n\nThe MEMORY highlights:\n1. Speaker B’s preference for traditional communication, which directly aligns with their statement in the dialogue about preferring phone calls over texting, indicating they are older and have a family of their own.\n2. Speaker A’s struggle with work-life balance and technology, corresponding with their need to use technology for communication due to work commitments.\n\nHowever, several details in the MEMORY are not directly relevant or seem to diverge from the existing dialogue context, such as:\n- Specific references to Speaker A's children's interests in music and technology, which are not directly relevant to the immediate conversation about texting.\n- Information about spending time in the park and musical instruments, which does not contribute directly to generating a response in this particular dialogue context.\n\nWhile the MEMORY does provide some relevant context, it could be more focused and concise in portraying only the necessary background to support dialogue generation effectively. The sentences could also better connect to emphasize the causal relationship between past interactions and the current conversation."
