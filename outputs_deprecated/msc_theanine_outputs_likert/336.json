Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it! Thank you for the recommendation.\nSpeaker B: Of course. I recommend that movie to everyone I meet. I think I've watched it over one hundred times. So what is the next movie on your list to watch soon?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is interested in watching movies, mentioned Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman. Speaker B is knowledgeable about movies and provides recommendations based on Speaker A's preferences. Speaker A relies on Speaker B for movie suggestions, mentioning a preference for comedies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful information for generating a response, as it includes relevant details about Speaker A's interest in movies, specifically mentioning \"Pulp Fiction\" and Uma Thurman, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A expresses enthusiasm for \"Pulp Fiction.\" It also notes that Speaker A relies on Speaker B for movie suggestions, which logically ties into the context because Speaker A has just thanked Speaker B for the recommendation. Additionally, the MEMORY mentions Speaker A's preference for comedies, which might inform future recommendations, although it is not directly relevant to the immediate context. Overall, the MEMORY is structured naturally and provides important contextual cues, but could be slightly more specific in detailing past interactions to merit a higher score."
