Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on!\nSpeaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar.\nSpeaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general?\nSpeaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts.\nSpeaker A: How's learning to bake going in general, especially now that you're off desserts?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A's strong connection to jello, especially cherry flavor, stems from their grandma making it at family dinners, leading to Speaker A learning various jello recipes from their grandmother.\n2. Speaker A's favorite jello eating habit transformed into a family tradition after learning how to make jello from their grandma, suggesting Speaker B to involve their grandmother in learning jello recipes.\n3. Speaker A's upbringing by two non-meat eater moms shifted into a family tradition of learning jello recipes from their grandma.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's been a bit challenging, but I'm enjoying the process of learning to bake healthier alternatives.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The mention of jello and family traditions connects to the topic of Speaker B teaching their kids to make their grandmother's jello recipe. However, the MEMORY primarily focuses on Speaker A's experiences with jello, rather than Speaker B's current situation with learning to bake and considering cutting out sugar. While the MEMORY does provide context about family traditions and jello, it is not directly tied to Speaker B's experiences in the current dialogue. The sentences in the MEMORY are naturally structured and demonstrate a connection with family traditions, which are a part of the dialogue context. However, they could better address the specific issues Speaker B is currently encountering, such as learning to bake without sugar. Overall, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful but could be more directly aligned with the ongoing conversation."
