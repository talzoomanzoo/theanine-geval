    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive.\nSpeaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price?\nSpeaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B expresses interest in potentially moving out of the city and enjoying a more peaceful life on the farm. Speaker A enjoys the peace and quiet of country life, the fresh produce, and fresh air.\nSpeaker A mentions that Speaker B's kids could try milking cows on the farm, which Speaker B finds amusing. Speaker A works on a family farm and will be using the new truck for farm work.\nSpeaker B believes that luxurious items distract from the value of their family. Speaker A bought 50 lotto tickets with different numbers to increase their chances of winning.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear. Music is always a good way to relax and unwind.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains a variety of topics that are not directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Speaker A's new iPhone and their enjoyment of listening to Blues and mixing music. While the MEMORY does contain some potentially useful context such as Speaker B's views on luxurious items which could relate to the discussion about the expensive iPhone, most of the MEMORY focuses on unrelated topics, such as life on a farm, farming tasks, and purchasing lottery tickets. These details could potentially distract the language model from generating a coherent response related to the iPhone discussion. Additionally, the connection between different elements in the MEMORY could be more clearly structured to indicate past interactions or developments between speaker A and B that are relevant to the ongoing dialogue."
