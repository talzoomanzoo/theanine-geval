Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet? \nSpeaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name?\nSpeaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \nSpeaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along!\nSpeaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them.\nSpeaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me!\nSpeaker A: Hahaha. Yes I agree its too hot to get a long hike in. I've been on some short ones, but the bugs eat me alive. I like to hike in the fall when the bugs are dying off and its a little cooler.\nSpeaker B: Ah yes, that's my favorite time of year. Oh and speaking of Tasha, I'm still amazed she knows Mandarin. Have you been learning more of the language?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has two sick kitties and recently received a rescue, which causes Speaker A to have a parrot named Tasha and be interested in adopting a rescue kitten. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've been trying to pick up a few basic phrases here and there, but Tasha is definitely the expert in our house!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information about Speaker B's interest in rescuing animals, which aligns with the dialogue context where Speaker B talks about rescuing animals and thinking about names for the kittens. It also mentions Speaker B recently received a rescue, which helps understand why they would be considering names. However, the MEMORY's information about Speaker A having a parrot and being interested in adopting kittens is somewhat relevant but not directly referenced in the dialogue context provided. The MEMORY includes Speaker B's consideration of giving the kittens Mandarin names, which connects back to the dialogue context mentioning Tasha, the parrot, knowing Mandarin. Overall, while there are connections, not all elements are directly relevant, and more context around the conversation topics would enhance the MEMORY's helpfulness."
