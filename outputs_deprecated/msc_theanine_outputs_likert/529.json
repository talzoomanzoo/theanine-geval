Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer?\nSpeaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to?\nSpeaker A: The museum has all sorts of galleries.  It has a sculpture garden outside.  I mostly like the impressionist paintings.  I like Van Gogh.  Was your concert outdoors?\nSpeaker B: Yes. That way they could have a fireworks show too. I love fireworks. Have you ever seen the fireworks at the Disney castle?\nSpeaker A: No, but I have been to Disney World in Florida.  I love fireworks too.  I want to get married on the 4th of July.  That was we will have a national holiday and fireworks for us every year!  It sounds like you've been to Disneyland?\nSpeaker B: No, but I thought you might have since you lived in LA for awhile. Did you get to see any live Disney music performances while you were at Disney World?\nSpeaker A: No, we rode a lot of rides that broke down.  We had to be rescued from the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.  It was stuck.  Someone put on waders and pushed us to the side to climb out.\nSpeaker B: Oh no! Hopefully your trip to the art museum is much better than that. Did your boyfriend go to Disney World too?\nSpeaker A: No, I had a cousin that I went with.  We stayed in a hotel in Miami too and I got so sunburned on the beach!  I'm sure the art museum will be good if it isn't too crowded.  Was your concert crowded?\nSpeaker B: It was so crowded, but my older brothers went with me and kept me from getting squished. Make sure you wear sunscreen when you visit the beach this time!\nSpeaker A: Yes, I know to put on SPF 75 this time!  So what is the art museum in Sao Paulo like?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, who has 2 older and 1 younger brother and whose father used to be a farmer, was born in Brazil, specifically in San Paulo. This is why Speaker B recommends visiting the Museum of Art of São Paulo in the city. In response, Speaker A is planning to visit the Museum of Art of São Paulo next week with their boyfriend. \n\nSpeaker B, who has 2 older and 1 younger brother and whose father used to be a farmer, was born in Brazil, specifically in San Paulo. This connection leads to Speaker A being interested in music concerts and planning a trip to Sao Paulo, ultimately causing Speaker A to plan a visit to the Museum of Art of São Paulo next week with their boyfriend. \n\nSpeaker A's love for Disney music is a common topic with Speaker B, who enjoys living in the city for the accessibility to food and live music. This shared interest leads Speaker B to recommend visiting the Museum of Art of São Paulo in the city, resulting in Speaker A planning to visit the museum next week with their boyfriend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "The art museum in São Paulo is absolutely stunning. You'll love the variety of galleries and the sculpture garden outside. It's definitely worth a visit!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about the relationship between Speaker A and Speaker B and mentions important details like Speaker B's origin and family structure. However, the information is somewhat redundant and does not directly relate to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where the main topic is the experience at music concerts and art museums, not specifically linked to Sao Paulo or Speaker B's family background. The Memory mentions planning a visit to the Museum of Art of São Paulo, which is somewhat relevant, but it doesn't provide significant helpful information for generating a response in the current dialogue context, given that the conversation's focus is only tangentially related. The memory lacks relevance and coherence that could aid a language model in enhancing the dialogue effectively."
