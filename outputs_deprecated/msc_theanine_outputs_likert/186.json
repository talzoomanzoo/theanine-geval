Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make?\nSpeaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A wakes up early in the morning to catch waves, while Speaker B likes to eat huge steaks after snowboarding. Speaker A prefers surfing and grew up in a beach town, but now likes cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally. Speaker A enjoys cooking and finds it helpful for stress relief. Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe, which always reminds them of the good old days. Speaker B's grandmother was the matriarch of the family, known for cooking large meals for family gatherings.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'd love to try your spicy fried rice sometime! It sounds like a flavorful dish.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several relevant details that can assist a language model in generating an appropriate response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker B's favorite dish is their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe, which directly connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B expresses fondness for garlic chicken and offers to make it. This detail not only highlights a shared interest in cooking between the speakers but also adds depth to Speaker B's character by linking it to family memories and traditions. Additionally, it mentions both Speaker A and B's enjoyment of cooking and the relaxation it provides, which could be referenced in future conversations about cooking or stress relief. However, while these aspects are pertinent, some parts of the MEMORY, like Speaker A's surfing and beach town background, aren't directly relevant to the current conversation about cooking or spicy foods, keeping the score from being a perfect 5. Nonetheless, the MEMORY is naturally structured, providing helpful context that supports interconnected dialogue."
