Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons\nSpeaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use.\nSpeaker B: I am a little scared of needles though. Were your tattoos painful?\nSpeaker A: Most of them were not.  It really depends on where on your body you get them.  Most of mine are on areas that didn't hurt.  The one on my foot and the one behind my ear did hurt a good bit.  Where were you thinking about getting it?\nSpeaker B: I hadn't really thought about it! Maybe upper arm or upper back? But I'm no tattoo expert. And I'd have to get permission from my wife first, LOL\nSpeaker A: Definitely talk to her first.  I had a friend that didn't talk to his wife and just came home with a tattoo one day.  It led to a huge fight - both about the money he spent and not discussing it with her.  He slept on my couch for over a week!\nSpeaker B: Oh no! Yeah, you don't want to spring something like that on your spouse. I don't think you mentioned before, are you married?\nSpeaker A: No.  I haven't found anyone that could deal with me or that I could deal with for more than a few months.  At this point, I have given up on the idea of getting married and want to focus on my artwork.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest. They enjoy getting tattoos and have 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father. They work at a coffee shop and are saving up for their next tattoo. Their favorite tattoo is the one dedicated to their late father, saying \"for you I shall live.\"\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's understandable. Focusing on your artwork sounds like a great way to channel your energy and creativity.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives details about Speaker A's tattoo preferences, their sentimental value, and their current lifestyle, which could be relevant for understanding Speaker A's perspective and motivations in the ongoing conversation about tattoos. However, it doesn't contain any direct mention or clues about the current relationship dynamics discussed, such as Speaker B's consideration for their wife's opinion, or the fears around getting a tattoo. The MEMORY is structured coherently and naturally, maintaining the context of Speaker A's tattoos and their connection to their father, which aligns well with the themes of the conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. These aspects make the MEMORY mostly helpful, but it could be more directly pertinent to the ongoing dialogue."
