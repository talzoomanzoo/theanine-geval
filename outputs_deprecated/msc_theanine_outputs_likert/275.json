Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her?\nSpeaker B: Hi there, hope you are wlll and managing to save up for your Italy trip?  Thank for asking about the Greek mythology study, we are doing very well. It helps because i am so passionate about it and hope to get to the Greek islands soon\nSpeaker A: Yes I have been saving up for another trip to Italy! I can't wait. It's planned for next Spring. Do you have any plans to go back to Italy in the future?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has suggested California as a destination for Speaker A's trip, and also mentioned trying surfing before but not being very good at it. Additionally, Speaker B expressed interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology. Speaker A, on the other hand, is fascinated by the architecture of Italy and enjoys studying history, especially through reading and watching documentaries. Speaker A is planning to travel to Italy alone for Spring Break and has friends from Europe meeting up with them. Furthermore, Speaker B enjoys Greek mythology and even did a case study on Poseidon, the God of the Sea, Earthquakes, and Horses.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'd love to go back to Italy someday, especially to explore more of the historical sites and architecture. Greece is also on my list, so maybe we'll swap travel stories soon!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant and helpful background information for Speaker B's character, which is beneficial for generating a next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker B's interest in Greek mythology and their plans to visit Greece, aligning well with the conversation about Greek mythology and travel interests. MEMORY also provides context on Speaker A's interests and travel plans, which may help Speaker B respond appropriately about Italy travel plans. However, the connection with California and surfing is not directly relevant to the current dialogue context, slightly reducing the overall helpfulness. Nonetheless, the MEMORY is generally well-structured and provides insight into both speakers' interests, supporting the development of ongoing conversations."
