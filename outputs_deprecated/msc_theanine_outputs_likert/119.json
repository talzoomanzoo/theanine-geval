Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok? \nSpeaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish?\nSpeaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus!\nSpeaker B: Oh that sounds absolutely fabulous. Are you going to get a free dessert, as well?\nSpeaker A: Yes, I am thinking about trying either the new eclairs, or their tres leches cake with fresh raspberry jam sauce and lemon drizzle! I have too many good options to pick from! What one would you pick?\nSpeaker B: Hands down, I would pick the tres leches. Ever since I tried it a few years ago, it has always been my favorite dessert.\nSpeaker A: Okay, I will try that! I've heard the can be made with different fruits. Did you have fruit with yours?\nSpeaker B: I like it best with fresh strawberries. And then it is even better with some fresh whipped cream and chocolate drizzle. Just thinking about it is making me want to have some right now!\nSpeaker A: Ooh, that sounds delicious! It's a rich and moist cake, so I don't think it should have too much chocolate. I've seen brown sugar and caramel versions too!\nSpeaker B: Oh I've never seen that version. That sounds scrumptuous. Tonight I'm going to bake some oatmeal raisin cookies.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys the interaction with people at work and the variety of experiences that come with it. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\nSpeaker A owns a restaurant and recently experienced a fire incident but managed to put it out. Speaker A had to put out a fire at work, which was unexpected but seems to have been handled without issues.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains certain pieces of information about Speaker A's work at a restaurant, which is marginally relevant in establishing context around the dialogue. The fact that Speaker A works at a restaurant and has some level of interaction there could potentially inform the language model's understanding of why Speaker A might be excited about new menu additions and getting free meals. However, the detail about owning a restaurant and experiencing a fire incident doesn't contribute to the current conversation surrounding dishes and desserts. Furthermore, this memory isn't organically structured to clearly convey a development or connection, nor is it phrased in a way that efficiently distinguishes helpful details from irrelevant ones related to the ongoing conversation. Thus, the MEMORY provides limited aid in generating an informed response in the continuation of this dialogue context."
