Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends?\nSpeaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do.\nSpeaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars.\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I think they go dark for a couple months and then have daylight for a couple months! I actually like night time, but having daylight all the time will make me crazy lol. Yeah I kind of hope it's dark for the camping but it will be very cold. I have heard Alaska has delicious ice cream. I want to try that while I'm there, \nSpeaker A: You'd have to get some serious blackout curtains for when it was daylight lol! You'll have to stock up on some warm essentials before heading out. You definitely don't want to get stuck in a bad situation in the cold, especially if you're alone. I bet they have great ice cream! You'll have to tell me about it when you get back!\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I need to call my friend and find out what season they are in so I can pack accordingly. I will take pictures of the ice cream too so I can tell you about it. I wonder if there are a lot of bears there? I don't like bears either.\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty sure they have grizzlies up there. You better pack something to fend them off too just in case. I bet your friend knows everything you'd need to keep them away.\nSpeaker B: I will bring whatever they let me bring on the airplane, but I am really counting on my friend to help me out with the local customs lol. Do you know if Rocky and Bullwinkle were from Alaska? \nSpeaker A: No, they were from Minnesota. Are you going to have your friend be your hiking guide?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B share a sense of humor and make each other laugh during the conversation. Speaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking. Speaker A mentions the outdoor activities they plan to do in Alaska, such as hiking.\nSpeaker B is going to Alaska for a vacation in two weeks and has some experience with flying on airplanes. Speaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together.\nSpeaker A and Speaker B share a sense of humor and make each other laugh during the conversation. Speaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking. Speaker A talks about the common perceptions of Alaska being cold, dark, and known for oil drilling.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information that aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the mention of outdoor activities in Alaska and the common perceptions of Alaska (cold, dark). However, it has several shortcomings. Firstly, it repeats the same information multiple times with slight variations (\"Speaker A and Speaker B share a sense of humor and make each other laugh during the conversation\" and \"Speaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking\"). Additionally, some parts of the MEMORY are either redundant or inaccurate, as there's no indication in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT that both speakers are planning a trip to Alaska together. Overall, the MEMORY does not provide much helpful and contextually rich information that would aid in constructing a proper response related to the ongoing conversation about the logistics and experiences of Speaker B's upcoming trip to Alaska. The MEMORY lacks coherence and does not demonstrate a clear development or causality, reducing its helpfulness."
