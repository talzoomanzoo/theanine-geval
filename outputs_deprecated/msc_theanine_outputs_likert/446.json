Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast.\nSpeaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project.\nSpeaker A: Quite a few, but it wasn't too crowded. It was a nice change of scenery. What kind of project are you working on?\nSpeaker B: I'm sure the student appreciate that. You teach as a group as apposed to one-on-one right? And one of the companies I work for had their system hit with a virus so I've been upgraded their software to debug the system.\nSpeaker A: I teach group classes and one on one, but I was the student today. I specialize in jiu-jitsu but today I got to be the student in a taekwondo class. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is a college student who teaches jiu-jitsu and is lactose intolerant. They are enrolled in a class on the history of martial arts and are majoring in athletic training. Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class and enjoys it. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts. \nSpeaker A is a college student who teaches jiu-jitsu and is lactose intolerant. They are taking a history of martial arts class and enjoy it. Both Speaker A and Speaker B are interested in martial arts and enjoy learning new things. \nSpeaker A is planning to take summer courses soon and is very active, enjoying martial arts. They are enrolled in a class on the history of martial arts and are majoring in athletic training. Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class and enjoys it. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great that you got to experience a different style of martial arts as a student today. How was the taekwondo class compared to your usual jiu-jitsu sessions?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains several pieces of information that are potentially helpful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it mentions Speaker A's role as a jiu-jitsu teacher and student, which connects with the context of Speaker A attending a martial arts class. Additionally, it highlights that both speakers have an interest in martial arts, which is relevant given the ongoing discussion about martial arts classes. However, the repeated mention of shared characteristics, such as Speaker A's major and courses, provides less immediate relevance to the current context of the dialogue.\n\nThe MEMORY could be improved by directly addressing the specific topics discussed in the context, such as Speaker B's work on debugging software and classes attended by Speaker A. Overall, while some parts of the MEMORY offer relevant connections, others do not add significant value to understanding the current dialogue context, thereby leading to this score."
