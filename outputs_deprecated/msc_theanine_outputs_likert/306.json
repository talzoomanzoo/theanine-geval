Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, an inventor working on a teleportation machine and a time machine, is currently focused on developing renewable energy sources for their inventions. This change in focus leads Speaker B to mention weight gain from spending time at the computer and express plans to work in the garden more. As a result, Speaker B wants to become more knowledgeable about plants and gardening, aiming to have a thriving garden.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great! I'd be happy to help you with gardening tips and suggestions. What kind of plants are you thinking of growing in your garden?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that Speaker B has a new interest and focus on gardening, which aligns with Speaker A's request for suggestions on making a garden. The past interaction notes Speaker B's increased interest in gardening, their intention to spend more time in the garden, and their aim to become more knowledgeable about plants. This context is directly relevant to Speaker A's inquiry, and it is phrased in a way that clearly connects past experiences and future intentions that can inform a thoughtful and meaningful response. Thus, the MEMORY is quite helpful in guiding the language model to provide a pertinent suggestion or advice to Speaker A."
