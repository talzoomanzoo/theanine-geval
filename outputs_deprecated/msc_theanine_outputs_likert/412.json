Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A recently got a Subaru and has a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Marmalade. Speaker A enjoys taking their kitten on trips. Speaker A usually leaves their cats with a friend while traveling.\nSpeaker B went on a trip to San Diego with kids, struggled with parking for the Subaru. Speaker B is not a cat person but ends up taking care of stray cats brought home by kids.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides several useful pieces of information that could help generate a response for Speaker B in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that Speaker A has a cat named Ginger and was considering naming a new kitten Marmalade, which directly relates to the kitten's naming in the dialogue. The memory also informs us about Speaker A's new Subaru and their habit of taking trips with cats, demonstrating their love for their pets, thus giving context to Speaker A's decision-making. On the other hand, the information about Speaker B struggling with parking for a Subaru on a trip and not being a cat person could lead Speaker B to either comment on similarities or differences in their situations, or express an opinion about the name change. While not all the MEMORY is directly tied to the dialogue context, the parts that are, allow connections to be drawn, making it largely helpful. However, the connection between Speaker B's memory and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is somewhat weaker, which is why it's not rated a 5. Nonetheless, the information is clearly structured and gives the language model a good foundation for crafting a response."
