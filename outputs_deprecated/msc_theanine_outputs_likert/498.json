Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive.\nSpeaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B have a friendly interaction and part ways on a positive note. Speaker A mentions that Speaker B's kids could try milking cows on the farm, which Speaker B finds amusing. This causes Speaker A to work on a family farm and will be using the new truck for farm work. \nSpeaker B believes that luxurious items distract from the value of their family. As a result, Speaker B leads a hectic life but is interested in attending the concert with their kids during winter break. This leads to Speaker B's children being sick, and Speaker B also had a fever, possibly influencing their decision to buy 20 lotto tickets.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I'm really enjoying all the new features and the improved camera quality.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that could potentially aid in generating a proper response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, the mention of Speaker B's financial and lifestyle philosophy (\"Speaker B believes that luxurious items distract from the value of their family\") could be helpful in crafting a response to Speaker A's comment about the iPhone being expensive. However, the MEMORY largely contains disjointed and irrelevant details that do not clearly develop or connect to the current conversation. The references to farm work, hectic life, concert interests, illness, and purchasing lotto tickets do not provide meaningful context for the current topic of discussion between Speaker A and Speaker B regarding the iPhone and its price. Thus, the MEMORY lacks coherency and does not effectively serve the dialogue, resulting in a low helpfulness score."
