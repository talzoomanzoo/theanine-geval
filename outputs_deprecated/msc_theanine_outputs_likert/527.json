    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer?\nSpeaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to?\nSpeaker A: The museum has all sorts of galleries.  It has a sculpture garden outside.  I mostly like the impressionist paintings.  I like Van Gogh.  Was your concert outdoors?\nSpeaker B: Yes. That way they could have a fireworks show too. I love fireworks. Have you ever seen the fireworks at the Disney castle?\nSpeaker A: No, but I have been to Disney World in Florida.  I love fireworks too.  I want to get married on the 4th of July.  That was we will have a national holiday and fireworks for us every year!  It sounds like you've been to Disneyland?\nSpeaker B: No, but I thought you might have since you lived in LA for awhile. Did you get to see any live Disney music performances while you were at Disney World?\nSpeaker A: No, we rode a lot of rides that broke down.  We had to be rescued from the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.  It was stuck.  Someone put on waders and pushed us to the side to climb out.\nSpeaker B: Oh no! Hopefully your trip to the art museum is much better than that. Did your boyfriend go to Disney World too?\nSpeaker A: No, I had a cousin that I went with.  We stayed in a hotel in Miami too and I got so sunburned on the beach!  I'm sure the art museum will be good if it isn't too crowded.  Was your concert crowded?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B was born in Brazil, specifically in San Paulo. - (Reason) - Speaker B recommends visiting the Museum of Art of São Paulo in the city. - (React) - Speaker A is planning to visit the Museum of Art of São Paulo next week with their boyfriend.\nSpeaker B drove over 1000 miles to see their favorite band, Three Dog Night. - (SameTopic) - Speaker A enjoys going to museums and trying different foods. - (Changed) - Speaker A plans to do lots of shopping during their trip.\nSpeaker A loves Disney music. - (SameTopic) - Speaker B enjoys living in the city for the accessibility to food and live music. - (Changed) - Speaker A's boyfriend enjoys drinking, so they are looking for good bars or clubs to enjoy the night.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "1. **Helpfulness Score: 2**\n\n2. **Explanation:**\n   - The MEMORY provided does not effectively aid Speaker B, the language model, in generating the next response based on the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Most of the information from MEMORY diverges from the topics currently being discussed in the dialogue context, such as music concerts, fireworks, Disney experiences, and visits to an art museum.\n   - The MEMORY contains some relevant information, like Speaker A's interest in museums, that aligns with the current dialogue about the museum visit. However, the connection to the Museum of Art of São Paulo mentioned in the MEMORY isn't evident in the current conversation, which is focused on a local art museum with impressionist paintings.\n   - Details about Speaker B being born in Brazil and driving long distances for concerts don't connect naturally with the flow of the current conversation. Similarly, Speaker A's boyfriend's preferences for bars or clubs are not directly related to the current context.\n   - The MEMORY elements are disjointed and do not provide clear context development or causality that ties them seamlessly with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
