    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing?\nSpeaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha!\nSpeaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes?\nSpeaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B recently divorced their wife and loves to scuba dive in Hawaii when not working. Speaker A is scared of sharks but finds the idea of going into a steel cage with them interesting. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies. \nSpeaker A is working on becoming an Eagle Scout and volunteers at a research lab. Speaker A does not have any pets and expresses an interest in scuba diving. Speaker B has an interest in diving and is planning to take neuroscience classes using the GI Bill. Speaker B is a veteran who went to the army after high school, interested in neuroscience and seeking advice on studying it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's fascinating! The complexity of reptiles is truly intriguing. Have you ever considered doing research on reptiles in the future?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information about the two speakers, but most of it does not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Speaker B's pet snakes and their interest in reptiles. Details like Speaker B's divorce, Speaker A's work towards becoming an Eagle Scout, and both speakers' interest in scuba diving, although potentially useful for understanding their personalities, do not provide meaningful context for generating a response focused on the current topic of reptiles and Speaker B's pet snakes. The MEMORY does mention Speaker A's amusement at Speaker B's preference for animals over humans, which could have been connected to the discussion about snakes but is not directly elaborated. Overall, the MEMORY lacks specific details or developments that would naturally aid in generating a pertinent next response to the dialogue about snake ownership and reptile admiration."
