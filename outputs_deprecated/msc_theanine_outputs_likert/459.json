Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue.\nSpeaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad.\nSpeaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs!\nSpeaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours?\nSpeaker A: Ikea! Their furniture is not to expensive and they have all kinds of furniture that'll go with whatever scheme you're going for. What kind of patio furniture were you looking for? Like a barbeque, chairs, hammock? \nSpeaker B: I guess I was going to get like an umbrella table and some chairs to go with it or maybe even a screened in gazebo with a fire pit in the middle.\nSpeaker A: That's a great idea! Sounds like a very nice place for a barbeque. What were you planning on grilling for the barbeque? \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is in the process of renovating their house to meet their living standards with their pets, planning to grill steaks this weekend and preferring an old charcoal grill. Speaker A is looking forward to spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights.\nSpeaker B and Speaker A both acknowledge their lack of expertise in interior decorating, and they plan to meet up to discuss the furniture exchange. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\nSpeaker B, who is looking for furniture shops to buy furniture, has two dogs, and works near a mall, is discussing furniture and home decor choices with Speaker A. This leads them to plan to meet up and exchange furniture ideas, with the possibility of enjoying a night with music, food, and company.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I was thinking of grilling some steaks this weekend, maybe some corn on the cob too. What do you usually like to grill during the summer?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes relevant details about Speaker B's house renovation and their preference for an old charcoal grill, which aligns with the context of planning a barbecue. It also mentions Speaker A's anticipation of quiet evenings outside and the possibility of grilling, which connects to the context of their interest in patio furniture and outdoor activities. However, the MEMORY introduces details like the discussion about furniture exchange and meeting up for music and food, which, while related, are not directly aligned with the specific dialogue context provided. The sentences in the MEMORY are naturally phrased and provide a background that could assist a language model to connect past interactions to the current dialogue. However, the lack of direct relevance and development toward the immediate context of planning the barbecue and patio setup limits its effectiveness to some degree."
