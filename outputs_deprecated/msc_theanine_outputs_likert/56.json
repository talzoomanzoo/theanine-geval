Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\nSpeaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys nature and works with animals, which is why they are an artist who walks through nature for work. Currently, Speaker B is re-reading 'Redwall' by Brian Jacques, a favorite book from their childhood. Speaker A, who is a fan of the Game of Thrones series and enjoys audiobooks, recommends \"A Game of Thrones\" by George R.R. Martin. Speaker A, a city dweller who walks to work, emphasizes the importance of proper form in exercise to prevent injuries.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but lacks a coherent structure and direct connections to the immediate conversation. The context given about Speaker B's appreciation for nature, which is mentioned in their enjoyment of walks, aligns with the dialogue topic about going on a nature walk. However, other information, like Speaker A's interest in audiobooks and the Game of Thrones series, does not directly contribute to generating a response about the nature walk. Additionally, the sentence about Speaker A's emphasis on proper exercise form could be relevant if the conversation turned to discussing the physical aspects of walking. Overall, MEMORY contains potentially useful background information but it only loosely supports continuing the current dialogue context."
