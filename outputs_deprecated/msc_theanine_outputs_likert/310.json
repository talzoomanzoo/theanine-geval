Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you.\nSpeaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them\nSpeaker A: IN MY HOME?! A TREE? That was not at all what I was thinking. Do they grow well indoors? I am intrigued. \nSpeaker B: Well if you want to make it like a proper garden experience then I would suggest going all in, and go for the best most authentic looking items you could get \nSpeaker A: Wow! Ok! This is sounding like a bigger undertaking! Should I embrace bugs in the home if they help the plants or am I getting wild?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden. Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Embracing bugs in your home can be beneficial for your plants, but it's ultimately up to your comfort level. There are ways to manage pests naturally if needed.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response, although not perfectly aligned with the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening and has a thriving garden, which aligns well with the ongoing topic of gardening and provides Speaker B with credibility in giving gardening advice. This sets the stage for Speaker B's continued guidance and suggestions regarding Speaker A's indoor garden exploration. However, the mention of Speaker B's weight gain and plans to work in the garden more, as well as Speaker A's intrigue about space plants, are not directly relevant to the current dialogue and could potentially distract from the main topic. Nonetheless, the memory provides a solid basis for the interactions, maintaining clarity in the relationship and roles between the speakers."
