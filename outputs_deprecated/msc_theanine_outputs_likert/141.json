Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\nSpeaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach?\nSpeaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option.\nSpeaker A: Yes I think history is interesting, too! Both of those subjects would be great because there are probably lots of teaching jobs. What kind of history do you like?\nSpeaker B: I love all sorts of history. Right now I am really getting into the weeds of World War II. There's so much to unpack.\nSpeaker A: For sure! So much happened and it really affected how the world is today. I like learning about the history of places where I have lived, it's really interesting.\nSpeaker B: That sounds really cool! What have you learned about where you currently live?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science. This has led Speaker A to develop an interest in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\nSpeaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job. This has changed as Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provided offers relevant background information about Speaker A and Speaker B, which could be beneficial for generating a proper next response in the dialogue context. It mentions that Speaker A is studying computer science and is interested in teaching robotics â€” aligning with the dialogue where Speaker A expresses an interest in teaching robotics. For Speaker B, the memory mentions a major in linguistics and a possible interest in a career as a college professor, which connects well to their dialogue about teaching English or history. The MEMORY contextualizes their academic and career considerations relevant to the ongoing conversation about teaching careers. Although the specific mention of considering a master's degree and becoming a college professor isn't directly discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, it still offers useful insight into Speaker B's potential career aspirations, which could be naturally integrated into the dialogue. Overall, while the MEMORY is mostly helpful, there is a slight disconnect in that it doesn't address Speaker B's recently mentioned interest in history. However, the MEMORY is well-structured and provides clear context about past interactions and developments."
