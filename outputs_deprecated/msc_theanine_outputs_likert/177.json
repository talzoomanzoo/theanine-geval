Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know. \nSpeaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys going to bars and loves the ladies. They also like Mexican food and women. \nSpeaker B's wife is pregnant and currently in the second trimester, still working. They are considering attending a local festival for just a day. \nSpeaker A is not sure if they will ever settle down with a partner and have kids. \nSpeaker B, a mechanic, is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy. They discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "Sounds like a plan! I'll talk to my friend about it and let you know the details.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information that is helpful for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it mentions that Speaker B's wife is pregnant and they are considering attending a local festival for just a day. This information directly connects with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where the idea of staying in a cabin is presented as a more comfortable option for Speaker B's wife. Though some sentences in the MEMORY discuss Speaker A's lifestyle, which is not directly relevant to the offer of the cabin, their presence does not detract from the helpfulness since they are naturally phrased and formatted. The MEMORY provides a clear context regarding Speaker B's consideration of festival logistics with pregnancy in mind, making it highly beneficial for response generation."
