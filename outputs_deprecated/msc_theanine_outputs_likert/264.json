Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go?\nSpeaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is dedicated to studying sports medicine on the way to college, resulting in all A's in the sports medicine class, while Speaker A struggles with maintaining good grades and excels only in gym.\n2. Speaker B is focused on sports medicine training and is preparing for an exam in that subject, feeling pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n3. Speaker B is studying sports medicine in college, while Speaker A finds history class boring and challenging, both feeling overwhelmed by external pressures and expectations.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, related to exams and studying. The MEMORY captures the context of Speaker B's dedication and stress related to their academic pursuits. It is clearly stated that Speaker B is studying sports medicine and aims for high academic performance, aligning with their comments about upcoming finals. The MEMORY also contrasts this with Speaker A's academic experience, mentioning that Speaker A excels in gym but struggles with maintaining good grades elsewhere, like history, which ties into the current conversation about their exam results. These insights help to better understand the pressures both speakers are facing and offer a comprehensive view of their academic challenges, offering contexts and pressures both speakers are facing. \n\nHowever, the MEMORY might miss a direct connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT in terms of specific subjects mentioned (for instance, there is no explicit mention of history in relation to Speaker A's studies outside of just finding it boring). Overall, the MEMORY is structured and provides a clear picture of the speakers' academic lives, which is useful for generating relevant responses, but could have a slightly clearer connection to topics being directly discussed in the dialogue."
