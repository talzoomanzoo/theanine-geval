Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok? \nSpeaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish?\nSpeaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus!\nSpeaker B: Oh that sounds absolutely fabulous. Are you going to get a free dessert, as well?\nSpeaker A: Yes, I am thinking about trying either the new eclairs, or their tres leches cake with fresh raspberry jam sauce and lemon drizzle! I have too many good options to pick from! What one would you pick?\nSpeaker B: Hands down, I would pick the tres leches. Ever since I tried it a few years ago, it has always been my favorite dessert.\nSpeaker A: Okay, I will try that! I've heard the can be made with different fruits. Did you have fruit with yours?\nSpeaker B: I like it best with fresh strawberries. And then it is even better with some fresh whipped cream and chocolate drizzle. Just thinking about it is making me want to have some right now!\nSpeaker A: Ooh, that sounds delicious! It's a rich and moist cake, so I don't think it should have too much chocolate. I've seen brown sugar and caramel versions too!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is interested in going rock climbing with Speaker A, as Speaker A enjoys the interaction with people at work and the variety of experiences that come with it, such as working at a restaurant and getting two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods. \nSpeaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit, leading to Speaker A enjoying the interaction with people at work and the variety of experiences that come with it, such as working at a restaurant and getting two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods. \nSpeaker B's love for the beach and Mediterranean food adds to their interests.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "The brown sugar and caramel versions sound intriguing! I might have to give those a try next time.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant details about Speaker A working at a restaurant and mentioning free meals, which are somewhat related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY doesn't specifically mention the excitement over the new dish on the menu, nor does it discuss the dessert options that were a major part of the conversation. Additionally, while it notes Speaker B's interests, this information lacks a clear connection to the current dialogue centered around food and desserts. The structure of MEMORY is repetitive and not concise, and it fails to clearly illustrate past interactions or create a useful foundation for generating the next response in this specific conversation. The unrelated mention of rock climbing adds to the disjointedness, making it less helpful for directly contributing to the dialogue about restaurant food and dessert choices."
