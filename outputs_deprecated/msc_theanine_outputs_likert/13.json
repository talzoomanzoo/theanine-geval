Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys watching swimming movies and wants to listen to punk music while swimming and learning programming. \nSpeaker A has known how to swim since the age of 5 and offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming. \nSpeaker B's favorite food is a pizzaburger and is looking forward to eating it in a pool with punk music playing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you, I appreciate your willingness to teach me how to swim. I'm excited for our meetup this weekend!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some helpful information that relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it notes that Speaker B wants to listen to punk music, which connects to Speaker A's creation of a punk music playlist. Additionally, Speaker A's offer to teach Speaker B to swim aligns with Speaker A's comment in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about teaching swimming. However, some parts of the MEMORY, like Speaker B's favorite food, do not directly relate to the current exchange and do not contribute much to generating the next response. The structure of the MEMORY does mention details that connect to past interactions, but not all sentences clearly contribute to developing a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Therefore, it is partially helpful, but there is room for improvement in terms of direct relevance and clarity of connections."
