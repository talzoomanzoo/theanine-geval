Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, as a therapist, discusses the challenges and rewards of the profession. They also express concerns about the costs associated with owning horses and explore the psychological aspects of horse ownership in relation to Freudian theories. \nSpeaker B's mother being a nurse led to their career as a therapist. They express a desire to have a horse in the future and contemplate the psychological aspects of horse ownership through Freudian theories. \nSpeaker A is experienced in horse breeding and care, working at a stable and enjoying being around horses. They transition from their expertise in horses to their lack of knowledge in psychology.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Therapy can definitely have a beginning, middle, and end, and it's great to hear about your positive experiences with your horses. Let me know if you ever decide to give therapy a try, I'd be more than happy to help.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that can help a language model generate a more informed and contextually appropriate response. It highlights Speaker B's background, motivations, and interests related to their career as a therapist, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT's focus on Speaker B's experiences in therapy. Additionally, it mentions Speaker A's involvement with horses and their lack of knowledge in psychology, which relates to their comments about finding therapy in horse riding. However, there are also aspects of the MEMORY, such as the Freudian theories and the detailed exploration of horse ownership, that stray somewhat from the immediate DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making the MEMORY less cohesive and somewhat less directly beneficial for predicting the next response. Overall, the MEMORY is contextually relevant and naturally structured but could be more directly connected to the specific dialogue exchange."
