    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume.\nSpeaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment. \nSpeaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think?\nSpeaker A: It depends on what you are trying to make out of origami, you can make some super complicated stuff, there's actually special paper that you can get for it! You may have seen origami be used in the hospital for some breathing aperatus!\nSpeaker B: That's amazing. I had no idea, but that totally makes sense. Do you have to practice a lot -- sort of a use it or lose it kind of thing?\nSpeaker A: Yea, I think for the more complicated origami it's kind of a use it or lose it but for the simple stuff you can usually take a couple months of and still remember to do it! Did you see origami in Japan?\nSpeaker B: Not up close, but I noticed a lot in shop windows in certain areas. I love Japan -- they're so welcoming. One of our acquaintances GAVE me a kimono. She said it's customary to try to share their culture. Kind of different from America in my opinion.  \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A finds meaning and fulfillment in doing volunteer work, which is why they are working on painting projects in their craft room. They are interested in trying to make a lotus origami next and wish to visit the country where origami was originally created, possibly Japan.\n\nSpeaker B enjoys running, singing, traveling, and visiting gardens. They are interested in trying to make a lotus origami next and Speaker A offered to teach them origami in a few weeks.\n\nSpeaker A enjoys art and music, specifically painting, and learned origami by themselves in their craft room. They are interested in trying to make a lotus origami next.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's so thoughtful of your acquaintance to share a piece of Japanese culture with you. It must have been an incredible experience receiving a kimono.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides background information about both Speaker A and B that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that Speaker A has an interest in origami, which corresponds to the context where they discuss origami contests and teaching Speaker B origami. The MEMORY mentions Speaker A offering to teach Speaker B origami, which aligns directly with the conversation where Speaker B expresses a desire to learn from Speaker A. Additionally, there is cohesiveness in how Speaker A's enjoyment of art and skill in origami, as well as Speaker B's interest in origami, is presented. However, the MEMORY includes some extra information that is not directly pertinent to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B’s other hobbies and Speaker A's broader fulfillment from volunteer work, which slightly diminishes the overall tailored helpfulness but does not significantly detract from its supportiveness. Overall, the MEMORY contributes well to understanding the context and Speaker A’s potential responses."
