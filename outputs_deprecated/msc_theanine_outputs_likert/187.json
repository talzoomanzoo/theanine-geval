Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make?\nSpeaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it.\nSpeaker A: I would love to, I enjoy cooking so maybe you can teach me to make it, too?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe because Speaker B's grandmother was the matriarch of the family, known for cooking large meals for family gatherings. \nSpeaker A likes cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally as a change from preferring surfing and growing up in a beach town.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a plan! I'd be happy to show you how to make spicy fried rice.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for Speaker B to generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It clearly links Speaker B's enjoyment of cooking and the significance of their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe to family gatherings, which can help elaborate on the personal connection to the dish mentioned in the dialogue. The MEMORY also states that Speaker A enjoys cooking new dishes, which aligns well with the suggestion that Speaker A comes over to learn the recipe from Speaker B. However, the mention of Speaker A's preference for surfing and growing up in a beach town, while interesting, is not directly relevant to the current dialogue context. Overall, most of the MEMORY is useful, relevant, and naturally structured, which supports a high score."
