Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies!\nSpeaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?  \nSpeaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere!\nSpeaker B: You have a point.  It is nice to see puppies wagging their tail and just following you!  Changing topics, do you have any recipes with asparagus?  You know, it's such a popular vegetable, but I just don't know how to prepare it.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Speaker A used to foster puppies but no longer does because they are busy with work, and now mainly cares for dogs at the animal shelter, but also cats, and loves when new puppies are brought in.\n- Speaker A's interest in science over music contrasts with Speaker B's love for Black Sabbath and grilling meat, but they both share a passion for animals, especially puppies, and visiting shelters in every city they go to.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I love asparagus! One of my favorite ways to prepare it is by roasting it with some olive oil, garlic, and parmesan cheese. It's simple and delicious!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful background information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It explains Speaker A's affinity for puppies by mentioning their past experience fostering puppies and their current involvement with animal shelters, which gives context to their preference for puppies over kittens in the dialogue. Additionally, the MEMORY notes both speakers' shared passion for animals and visiting shelters, which aligns with the topic of the conversation. However, the information about Speaker A's interest in science and Speaker B's love for Black Sabbath and grilling meat does not directly contribute to understanding or expanding upon the current dialogue about animal preferences or cooking asparagus. While this information is naturally connected and phrased well, its relevance to the context is limited, preventing a higher score. Nonetheless, the MEMORY still provides a degree of helpfulness for constructing a relevant response based on the existing conversation."
