Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not!\nSpeaker B: Have you been hiking lately?\nSpeaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks, and has planned several camping trips for the summer. She will also be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail for 10 days.\n2. Speaker A has a pet parrot named Tasha and works as a personal trainer leading hikes. This led to Speaker A becoming a personal trainer who loves camping in remote areas. Recently, Speaker B went on a long hike and enjoyed it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's great that you're getting others out on the trails with you, even if they tire out quickly!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY is quite helpful as it provides valuable information about Speaker A's interests and activities related to hiking and camping. It mentions Speaker A's enjoyment of camping trips and hiking trails, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A talks about repellent and hiking. The inclusion of details about planning summer camping trips and the Appalachian Trail is relevant and can aid Speaker B in generating a contextually appropriate response. Although not directly mentioned in the context, the information about Speaker A's pet parrot and occupation adds depth to their character. However, the mention of Speaker B's own hiking experience is less relevant to the current context, which slightly affects the score. Overall, the MEMORY provides well-structured and relevant information, justifying a score of 4."
