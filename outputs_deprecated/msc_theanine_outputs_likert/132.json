Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities. \nSpeaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job. Speaker A is studying computer science and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I have thought about teaching as a potential career path. It seems like a stable and rewarding option.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided is relevant and helpful for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes pertinent information about both speakers' education and career aspirations, which are directly related to the topic of career options and teaching discussed in the context. Speaker B's considerations of becoming a college professor and feeling limited in job opportunities are particularly helpful for responding to Speaker A's suggestion about teaching. The MEMORY also mentions Speaker A's current studies and future goals, which adds depth to their perspective on job security in teaching. The development of events and relationships between the speakers are clearly demonstrated, although there could be slightly more direct connection or relevance to the conversation about teaching as a more guaranteed job option specific to linguistics. Overall, the MEMORY provides a good foundation for generating an informed and contextually relevant response."
