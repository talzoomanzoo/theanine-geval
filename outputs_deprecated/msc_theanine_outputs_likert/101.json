Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends?\nSpeaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do.\nSpeaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is unsure about what else there is to do in Alaska besides hiking. Speaker B is going to Alaska for a vacation in two weeks and has some experience with flying on airplanes. Speaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great idea! Camping under the stars in Alaska would be an incredible experience.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information that gives context to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is not entirely clear or directly relevant to the current conversation. It does indicate that Speaker B is planning to go to Alaska, which aligns with Speaker B's discussion about activities during the trip. It also mentions that Speaker B has experience with flying, which although not directly relevant to the current discussion about sledding or daylight cycles, is useful background information. Speaker A's familiarity with Alaska and outdoor activities is relevant to A's interest in seeing the stars and finding activities. However, the MEMORY states that Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip together, which contrasts with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B discusses going with friends. This discrepancy can cause confusion. Overall, while some sentences provide context, the connections and development of past interactions could be clearer and more directly tied to the current context."
