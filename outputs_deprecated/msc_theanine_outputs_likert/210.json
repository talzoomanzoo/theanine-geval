Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships!\nSpeaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!   I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field?\nSpeaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate?\nSpeaker B: I have another year- so this year is really important I get internships and start making connections in the field.   I love going to the beach too.  What happened with your knees that now cause you so much pain?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A mentioning their neighbor John, who loves soccer, leads Speaker B to study sports medicine, play soccer, and aim to join their college team. This interest causes Speaker B to seek internships in sports medicine and enjoy surfing instead. Speaker B's professors being supportive in writing letters for an internship application causes Speaker A to offer advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field. Speaker B, as a college student playing soccer with peers, transitions to looking for internships in sports medicine, asking professors for letters of recommendation. This change results in Speaker B struggling to find internships and feeling disadvantaged compared to those with connections.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I had a few injuries from playing sports when I was younger, and they just caught up with me over the years. It's great that you're focused on internships and making connections in your field. Keep pushing forward, it will pay off in the long run!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker B's interest and pursuit in sports medicine, which could be helpful for generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it highlights Speaker B's transition from studying sports medicine to seeking internships, which aligns with Speaker B's current focus on internships. However, the memory contains several fragmented sentences that are not cohesively linked or naturally structured, and some parts are less directly relevant to the current conversation. The development and connections between sentences could be more clearly demonstrated to provide a more coherent background for the dialogue context. Overall, while there are elements that align with the dialogue context, the structure and clarity of the memory could be improved for a higher score."
