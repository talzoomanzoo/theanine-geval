Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast.\nSpeaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project.\nSpeaker A: Quite a few, but it wasn't too crowded. It was a nice change of scenery. What kind of project are you working on?\nSpeaker B: I'm sure the student appreciate that. You teach as a group as apposed to one-on-one right? And one of the companies I work for had their system hit with a virus so I've been upgraded their software to debug the system.\nSpeaker A: I teach group classes and one on one, but I was the student today. I specialize in jiu-jitsu but today I got to be the student in a taekwondo class. \nSpeaker B: That's even better, learning is a life-long journey. How are you class on martial art history? When you have time teach me too, I'd love to learn. \nSpeaker A: It's been a little stressful lately, because finals are coming up...but I'm confident in that class. I could've aced it before I even started! I'll definitely get started with you after finals.\nSpeaker B: Ahaha we;; for someone who's so passionate about martial arts I'm not surprised. Great, I'll try to be the best student I can. I'm starving, think I should grab some take-out from Sufi?\nSpeaker A: Of course! It's your favorite after all! Now you made me hungry! lol\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is planning to take summer courses soon and is very active, enjoying martial arts. Speaker A is enrolled in a class on the history of martial arts and is majoring in athletic training. Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class and enjoys it. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a helpful context for Speaker B to generate a response. It reiterates that Speaker A is studying the history of martial arts and is majoring in athletic training, which aligns with the dialogue context where Speaker A expresses confidence in their martial arts history class. It also notes that Speaker B is involved in software work and has an interest in martial arts, which matches Speaker B's dialogue about working on a software project and expressing a desire to learn martial arts from Speaker A. The MEMORY is well-structured, presenting relevant information about both speakers' interests and activities, which helps maintain the flow of the conversation. However, the MEMORY could have been scored higher if it included more specific details or connections explicitly mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the specifics about Speaker B debugging a system or considering take-out from Sufi."
