Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy playing video games in their free time. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil. Speaker B mentions that Resident Evil can be scary and provides some tips for playing it. Speaker B is interested in playing Jurassic Park: World but has not played it yet. Speaker B is interested in trying the Jurassic Park game.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY is largely helpful for generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It provides relevant information that connects to Speaker A's question about Resident Evil. The MEMORY confirms that Speaker B recently bought Resident Evil VIII and considers it can be scary, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about playing Resident Evil. Additionally, it highlights that both speakers enjoy playing video games, and they plan to play games together. This context helps the language model build a response and provides good insights into their shared interest in gaming. While the mention of Speaker B's interest in Jurassic Park: World is not directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, it's phrased in a way that it can be easily identified as a separate interest not tied to the current discussion. Overall, the MEMORY is structured logically, providing useful cues about past interactions that are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
