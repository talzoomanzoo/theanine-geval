Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?\nSpeaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities. Speaker B is interested in finding family discounts for the zoo. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n2. Speaker B is away from their child and glad that the pets are with them. Speaker B expresses concern about leaving a kitten alone during their family camping adventures. Speaker A assures Speaker B that kittens are not as much work as expected and can be left for short periods, even mentioning kitty daycares.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've done a bit of camping, but I prefer exploring cities. It's great to hear your daughter had a good time on the trip!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information that can be related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically regarding camping and Speaker B's parenting. The second memory mentions Speaker B's camping adventures with family, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B mentions having a great weekend. Additionally, it touches on Speaker B's concern about their pets, which may be relevant if the conversation turns to responsibilities or challenges during their travel. However, the first memory about Speaker A enjoying zoo visits and Speaker B's interest in zoo discounts is not directly connected to the current conversation about the camping trip, although it establishes some background on their interests relating to family activities.\n\nOverall, while portions of the MEMORY do provide relevant context that could help generate a response, particularly the elements related to camping and family, not all of it is directly applicable to the immediate conversational turn. The natural phrasing and development in MEMORY help establish this context, leading to a middle rating."
