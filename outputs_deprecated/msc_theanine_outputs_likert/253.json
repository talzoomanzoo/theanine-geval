Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\nSpeaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\nSpeaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\n\nMEMORY:\n- Speaker B's father was involved in producing horror movies, which influenced Speaker B's favorite genre. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\n- Speaker B has two kids and enjoys painting and taking naps. Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them. Speaker A also likes mid-century design and is a fan of horror movies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Oh, absolutely! There have been some spine-chilling moments on set, that's for sure.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information regarding Speaker B's background and interests in producing horror movies, which directly aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, the detail about Speaker B's father influencing their interest in horror movies and their collaborative creative process is particularly useful for understanding Speaker B's passion and experience in the field mentioned in the conversation. This connection between past interactions and current context provides valuable context for generating a relevant follow-up response.\n\nHowever, some details in MEMORY, like Speaker B's enjoyment of painting and taking naps, while naturally structured, are not directly linked to the dialogue context and do not significantly aid in response generation. Additionally, details about Speaker A's preferences add context but don't directly impact Speaker B's next response in this dialogue.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY effectively supports the dialogue with relevant information, but some aspects could be more directly aligned with the conversation's focus."
