Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her?\nSpeaker B: Hi there, hope you are wlll and managing to save up for your Italy trip?  Thank for asking about the Greek mythology study, we are doing very well. It helps because i am so passionate about it and hope to get to the Greek islands soon\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has been to Italy in the past and enjoyed the food there. This fascinates Speaker A, who is fascinated by the architecture of Italy and enjoys studying history, especially through reading and watching documentaries.\nSpeaker A is planning for a spring break trip and recently bought a dress for Easter. She wants to share her love of Greek mythology with her daughter. Speaker B, on the other hand, does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology. This interest stems from Speaker B's appreciation for superhuman powers and historical events involving such figures.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's wonderful to hear! The Greek islands would be a fantastic destination for exploring your interest in mythology. I'm sure you both would enjoy it.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker B's interest in Greek mythology and history, which aligns with the conversation about sharing Greek mythology with her daughter. Additionally, there is a connection to Speaker B's desire to visit Greece, which was indirectly alluded to in the context. However, the MEMORY also contains information that is not directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A's fascination with Italian architecture and Speaker A's recent purchase of a dress for Easter. While these details are naturally phrased, they do not significantly aid in understanding or responding to the immediate context of the dialogue. Consequently, the MEMORY provides a moderate level of helpfulness."
