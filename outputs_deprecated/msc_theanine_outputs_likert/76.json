Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play? \nSpeaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music.\nSpeaker A: ah right, who's your favourite rock band?\nSpeaker B: I'm big fan of aerosmith. When do you learn music. Whom teach you?\nSpeaker A: aerosmith are great, have you ever seen them live? I have been playing drums since i was a kid, my father taught me when I was young and from then on I just taught myself\nSpeaker B: That's awesome! I have been trying to learn last one year. Still I didn't get right teacher. I'm jealous on you. I don't have like your dad.\nSpeaker A: what instrument have you been trying to learn?\nSpeaker B: Piano is my favorite instrument. When try play my mind was mesmerizing. How do you learn surfering?\nSpeaker A: I learnt to surf from one of my good friends, he surfed in a number of competitions and did very well. Would you like to learn to surf if you had more time?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I would like to learn surfing with my friends at weekend. But my friends didn't have interesting on surfing.\nSpeaker A: That's a shame, I'm sure you could find a club to surf with at a local beach. Have you been out fishing recently?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A was good at writing in school, while Speaker B was bad at math and preferred fishing. Speaker B is looking forward to taking a break from work and going fishing. Speaker B finds fishing easier than surfing, but is interested in trying surfing. Speaker B is willing to teach Speaker A how to fish and cook.\n\nSpeaker B loves fishing and spending time near the ocean, but doesn't have time to surf anymore due to working at a doctor's office. Speaker A enjoys surfing and music as a way to escape from daily life. Speaker B wishes they had time to go surfing and is considering getting lessons at a surf shop. Speaker B received a new recipe book for their birthday in May.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I haven't been fishing in a while, but I'm hoping to go this weekend if the weather is nice.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be useful for Speaker B (the language model) to generate a response in DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it mentions that Speaker B is interested in trying surfing and wishes they had more time for it, which aligns with the ongoing conversation about surfing in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It also references Speaker B's interest and availability (or lack thereof) regarding surfing, which could be a natural extension of the conversation already happening. However, many parts of the MEMORY are unrelated or poorly connected to the immediate context of the dialogue. Details about Speaker B's skills at school, their job, or Speaker A's writing capabilities are not directly relevant to the current conversation about music and surfing. While these sentences are phrased naturally, they do not strongly demonstrate development of the specific interaction between the speakers as reflected in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Thus, the MEMORY provides some usefulness but has room for improvement in its incorporation of more contextually connected and relevant past details."
