Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, who does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies, reacted positively when Speaker A offered to teach them how to swim and programming. Speaker A's plan to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination changed as they signed up for several trips. This led to Speaker A planning a snorkeling trip and looking forward to traveling to the Caribbean for their next trip. Additionally, Speaker B expressed their enjoyment of cruising in their car while listening to punk music, which sparked a conversation about the potential of Speaker A and Speaker B getting on a cruise ship together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'll definitely let you know how it goes. It's going to be a fantastic experience for sure.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker B's positive reaction to Speaker A's offer to teach swimming, which aligns well with the discussion in the context about teaching swimming. It also notes Speaker A's upcoming snorkeling trip to the Caribbean, which is connected to the conversation about going on a cruise and traveling to the Caribbean. Moreover, the MEMORY mentions Speaker B's enjoyment of cruising while listening to punk music, which could be linked to Speaker A's creation of a punk music playlist for their meetup. However, some elements, like the aspect of programming studies and specific cruise destination plans, are less connected. Overall, the MEMORY is well-structured and offers helpful contextual cues for generating a response, hence a score of 4."
