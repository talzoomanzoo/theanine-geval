Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys the interaction with people at work and the variety of experiences that come with it, which causes Speaker A to work at a restaurant and invite Speaker B to visit.\n2. Speaker A wants to go rock climbing with Speaker B, and Speaker A also enjoys the interaction with people at work and the variety of experiences that come with it.\n3. Speaker A owns a restaurant and recently experienced a fire incident but managed to put it out, which led to Speaker A working at a restaurant and inviting Speaker B to visit.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides limited helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n1. The MEMORY includes information about Speaker A's enjoyment of their work environment, which partially relates to the context of Speaker A expressing excitement about new menu items at work. However, this connection is not explicitly clear or particularly relevant to the specific situation described in the dialogue, which is about trying a favorite dish and sharing a picture.\n\n2. The MEMORY mentions Speaker A inviting Speaker B to the restaurant, which could be mildly relevant if Speaker A were to invite Speaker B to try the new dish. However, this connection is not made explicit in the MEMORY.\n\n3. Other details in the MEMORY, such as rock climbing and the restaurant fire incident, do not contribute to the immediate dialogue context and are not structured in a way that provides clear development or causality related to Speaker A's current excitement or future action of sharing a picture.\n\nOverall, while there are elements in the MEMORY that tangentially relate to Speaker A's work setting, they lack clear and direct relevance, lowering the helpfulness score."
