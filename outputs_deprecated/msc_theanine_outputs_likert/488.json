Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for.\nSpeaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for?\nSpeaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys camping, hiking, and is kind, caring, and hopeful for group equality. Speaker A plans to potentially visit the Columbia Trail and Ken Lockwood Gorge for a camping and hiking trip. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\nSpeaker B does not vote and wants their neighbor John to know about their stance on group equality. Speaker B's neighbor, John, is getting divorced and selling top-of-the-line camping gear. Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\nSpeaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs. Speaker A plans to potentially visit the Columbia Trail and Ken Lockwood Gorge for a camping and hiking trip. Speaker A plans to leave a hammock by the river for anyone to use at a hidden spot off the main hiking trail. There is a lake at the hiking trail, and Speaker A suggests swimming in it, warning that the water may be cold.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've been doing odd jobs here and there, nothing too steady. But I'm glad to hear you're excited about the job offer! It's great when you enjoy the people you work with.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY contains several pieces of information that could be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but is not entirely focused on the current conversation. Some information about Speaker B, such as their enjoyment of camping and hiking, aligns with Speaker A's interest in visiting the Columbia Trail and Ken Lockwood Gorge, which could help facilitate future conversations between the speakers. Additionally, the reference to Speaker B's friend having worked at the same grocery store and enjoyed the people there offers a helpful connection to Speaker A's context regarding their new job at the store. However, a significant amount of content is unrelated to the current dialogue, such as details about Speaker B's stance on voting and group equality, or specific plans Speaker A has for their future hiking trips, which don't directly influence the dialogue at hand. While these memories are naturally structured and easy to understand, they don't fully demonstrate clear causality and relevance to the ongoing dialogue, resulting in a mid-range score."
