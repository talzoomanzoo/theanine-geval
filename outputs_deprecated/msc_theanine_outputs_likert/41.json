Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden?\nSpeaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends.\nSpeaker A: That sounds nice! So how is your job going?\nSpeaker B: Always interesting, that's for sure! I have been training to nurse on a new floor, so that'll give me a change of scenery.\nSpeaker A: Does that add a lot of extra work to your plate?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses, which causes Speaker A to consider visiting their cousin in Sweden and save money for the trip. Speaker B recommends checking out the volcanoes in Sweden for a unique experience, which they would like to do together. Speaker B grew up in Sweden and developed an interest in good coffee and chocolates, which was discussed with Speaker A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some elements that could potentially relate back to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the mention of Speaker B not having visited Sweden for a long time and the suggestion of visiting volcanoes, despite Sweden not being known for volcanoesâ€”this could hint at other activities or places that Speaker B might enjoy suggesting to Speaker A. However, the mention of good coffee and chocolates, while a personal characteristic of Speaker B, is not clearly connected to the ongoing conversation about planning a trip or working as a nurse. Furthermore, the memory is poorly structured and fails to naturally convey the development or relevance of past interactions related to the conversation. The causal and connected narrative of past interactions in the memory would help establish a more significant contextual foundation for the conversation at hand, which the memory currently lacks. Therefore, it does not sufficiently provide helpful information for generating a next response in the dialogue."
