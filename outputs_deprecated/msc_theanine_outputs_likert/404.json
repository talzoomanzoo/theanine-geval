    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read.\nSpeaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting? \nSpeaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far.\nSpeaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys spending time with their grandchildren, who are old enough to entertain themselves using technology or watching TV. Speaker A suggests taking naps during quiet times and mentions watching her grandkids. \nSpeaker A and Speaker B discuss their children getting older and becoming more independent. \nSpeaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix. Speaker B is considering volunteering at an animal shelter when her son starts school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I do enjoy a good mystery to keep me on the edge of my seat. It's a nice escape from reality for a while.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about Speaker A's interests and family, which can be useful for understanding their preferences, such as enjoying intense fiction. However, the details do not directly connect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which mainly focuses on Speaker A's current activity of reading a crime drama, and Speaker B's preference for calmer tastes. The MEMORY lacks detailed development or specific past interactions directly relevant to the context. Additionally, sentences about Speaker B considering volunteering do not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While the MEMORY provides a general background, it doesn't offer particular cues that would be helpful for generating a response in the current dialogue scenario."
