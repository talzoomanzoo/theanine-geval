    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me?\nSpeaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week?\nSpeaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day\nSpeaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through\nSpeaker A: Actually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to it. Do you think I will need to rent a car when I'm there, or is it possible to walk and bike in the summer? I always picture huge amounts of snow but I'm not sure if it's like that all year round.\nSpeaker A: I would definitely recommend looking for a rental car to have on hand. There is a town within walking distance from me, but it can be dangerous to walk with the wolves and elk around, especially at night.\nSpeaker B: I imagine so!!! I wouldn't want to run into a wolf! Ok. I will add car rental to my plans. Do you get scared with your dogs, that you will run into wildilfe like that?\nSpeaker A: I think I'm more afraid of the wildlife than my dogs are. If I had to, I think I could muster the courage to face the animals out here, but I will happily avoid them when possible. With you around, I'd feel much better, as well. How do you feel about being that close to wildlife?\nSpeaker B: Well I don't have a lot of experience with that but I guess I'd be ok as long as I knew what to do. Most of the wildlife I see is squirrels, pigeons, and the occasional possum. \nSpeaker A: We have plenty of those out here, as well, and you'll see them far more often than you'll see wolves. We will just have to take extra precautions at night and make sure we don't leave any food outside that might attract them.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is interested in visiting Alaska and mentions getting blackout curtains due to the midnight sun.\nSpeaker B found flights that work for their schedule and price and will be visiting Speaker A in a couple of weeks.\nSpeaker B is planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\nSpeaker A suggests going on hikes in Alaska to see wildlife and mentions glaciers as a potential attraction.\nSpeaker A mentioned the wildlife, including elk and wolves.\nSpeaker B is interested in going whale watching and asks about a wolf petting zoo.\nSpeaker A mentions the \"midnight sun\" phenomenon in Alaska where the sun does not set during the summer.\nSpeaker A mentioned making poached eggs for breakfast and taking sleds pulled by dogs.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a plan. I'll make sure to keep that in mind to stay safe. I'm excited to experience the wildlife in Alaska, especially with your guidance.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that can be helpful for generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes details about Speaker B's interest in visiting Alaska and participating in various activities, including concerts and outdoor activities, which aligns with their current conversation about planning the visit and attending a concert. The MEMORY also contains relevant information about wildlife, such as the mention of wolves, which directly relates to the existing dialogue where Speaker B discusses concerns about wildlife encounters while visiting. However, the MEMORY also contains less relevant information, such as poached eggs and sleds pulled by dogs, which are not directly connected to the ongoing conversation. While some provided details align with the topics in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, there is a lack of cohesion and clear narrative structure in the MEMORY, which makes it less helpful overall. A higher score would be awarded if the MEMORY was more naturally structured to detail the development of conversations and interactions related to the current context."
