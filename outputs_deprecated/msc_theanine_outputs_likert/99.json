    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is going to Alaska for a vacation in two weeks and has some experience with flying on airplanes. Speaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together. Speaker A and Speaker B share a sense of humor and make each other laugh during the conversation. Speaker B is unsure about what else there is to do in Alaska besides hiking. Speaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet. Speaker B mentions that southern Alaska has warmer temperatures in the summer.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a fairly helpful context for generating a response as it contains information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights that Speaker B is planning a trip to Alaska but is unsure about activities beyond hiking, which directly ties into Speaker A's query about any new ideas for the trip. This provides a direct cue that Speaker B might need suggestions or could express uncertainty or curiosity about possible activities, which Speaker A with knowledge of Alaska might address. Additionally, it is noted that both speakers share a sense of humor, which can influence the tone of Speaker B's response. However, some information in the MEMORY, such as Speaker A's familiarity with outdoor activities, is not directly relevant to Speaker B's perspective or current need within this context. Overall, the memories are connected and phrased clearly, but a bit more focus on Speaker B's specific concerns could enhance the overall help."
