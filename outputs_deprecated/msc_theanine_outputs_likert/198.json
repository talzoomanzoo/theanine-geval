    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college?\nSpeaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position. \nSpeaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket, but now plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week. Despite not being into music, Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments. \nSpeaker A is a college student studying Humanities and wants to finish college before looking for a job, expressing interest in working in HR and appreciating the recommendation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I do miss it sometimes, but it's definitely a lot of pressure being a goalkeeper.",
    "prediction": "3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could help generate a proper next response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker A's involvement in soccer, their position as a striker, and an upcoming match, which are all related to the current topic of soccer. However, other details like Speaker A's studies in Humanities, plans for the future, or preferences regarding music do not directly contribute to the current conversation about soccer. While these additional details are phrased naturally, they do not provide strong contextual cues for the specific dialogue about missing playing soccer. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it contained more direct connections to Speaker B's feelings about the goalkeeper position or any related past interactions."
