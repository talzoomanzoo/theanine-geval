Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\nSpeaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car?\nSpeaker B: Yes, there are several. Hope we could meet and You possibly teach me about computer programming.\nSpeaker A: That would be great too. I like to program in several different languages. Do you have a preference?\n\nMEMORY:\n- Speaker A recently started a new job in computer programming and offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n- Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming. \n- Speaker A has planned to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination, sparking a discussion about the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is not entirely comprehensive or well-structured to score higher. \n\n1. The MEMORY mentions that Speaker A has offered to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming, which aligns well with the context where Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B swimming.\n2. The MEMORY mentions Speaker B's enjoyment of punk music, which is relevant as Speaker A has made a playlist of punk music for the meetup.\n3. Lastly, the MEMORY notes the potential of getting on a cruise ship together and Speaker A planning activities related to snorkeling, which connects to their conversation about cruises and going to the Caribbean.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY lacks some specific details from the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the programming languages Speaker A prefers or Speaker B's interest in visiting cities while cruising, which could provide a clearer picture of their past interactions. Overall, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful but does not fully encompass all aspects of their past interactions related to the context."
