Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends?\nSpeaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do.\nSpeaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars.\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I think they go dark for a couple months and then have daylight for a couple months! I actually like night time, but having daylight all the time will make me crazy lol. Yeah I kind of hope it's dark for the camping but it will be very cold. I have heard Alaska has delicious ice cream. I want to try that while I'm there, \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B share a sense of humor and make each other laugh during the conversation. Speaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking. Speaker A mentions the outdoor activities they plan to do in Alaska, such as hiking. Speaker A has the impression that Alaska is cold and snowy, wondering if there are ski slopes there. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe memory provides some useful background information that could help Speaker A generate a relevant response. It indicates that Speaker A and Speaker B share a sense of humor, which might influence the tone of the conversation. It also mentions that Speaker A is familiar with outdoor activities in Alaska and that the two are planning a trip there together. These details could be useful in shaping Speaker A's response to maintain a tone consistent with their relationship and to potentially reference shared plans or knowledge about Alaska.\n\nHowever, the memory lacks specific details directly related to the current dialogue context, especially regarding the aspects of the trip that were explicitly discussed, like sledding with dogs or considerations related to the unique daylight cycle in Alaska. This limits its overall helpfulness in generating a precise continuation of the conversation without requiring A to ask clarifying questions or making assumptions beyond what's provided in the memory. Therefore, while the memory offers a good base of general information, it's not as directly helpful in progressing the ongoing conversation."
