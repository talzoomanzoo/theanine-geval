Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well?\nSpeaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is studying marketing and enjoys it. Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work. Speaker B signed up for classes at the local college and has a background in football and karate. \nSpeaker A hopes to create ads for movies after graduating. Speaker A is studying marketing and enjoys it. Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work. Speaker B attends football games at their old high school and finds that their football background helps in karate footwork. \nSpeaker B practices karate and works as a lifeguard but is looking for a different career. Speaker B is considering a career change to the IT sector due to their computer skills and the growing demand for employees in that sector. Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work.

    "raw_prediction": "I've only dabbled in martial arts, but I've been considering trying out some classes to see if I enjoy it.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, especially regarding Speaker B's involvement in karate. Knowing that Speaker B holds a green belt and has a background in football, which helps their karate footwork, can add meaningful context to the dialogue about martial arts. However, the MEMORY contains a lot of redundant information, and details about Speaker A's study in marketing are not relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, while the mention of Speaker B signing up for classes and a consideration for IT work is somewhat useful for future conversations, it does not contribute directly to the interaction about martial arts. The clutter of repeated and somewhat less relevant details reduces the overall helpfulness and could make it harder for the language model to focus on important cues."
