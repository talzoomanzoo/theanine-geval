Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys art and music, specifically painting and is working on painting projects in their craft room. They are interested in trying to make a lotus origami next and learned origami by themselves in their craft room. Additionally, Speaker A volunteers at a hospital and enjoys making origami crafts, specifically a 3D modular swan with glue.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a proper next response. It includes relevant details about Speaker A's interest in art and origami, which align with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A mentions winning a prize in an origami contest. The mention of Speaker A learning origami by themselves and the specific interest in making a lotus origami provide contextual cues that can be used to respond appropriately to Speaker A's excitement in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Furthermore, the MEMORY mentions Speaker A volunteering at a hospital and making origami crafts, which, although not directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, are naturally phrased and give a fuller picture of Speaker A's background. This allows the language model to identify important cues and potentially engage in further conversation about Speaker A's interests and accomplishments. One aspect that prevents the MEMORY from receiving a perfect score of 5 is that it does not clearly demonstrate a sequence or causality of past interactions with Speaker B. However, it provides useful groundwork information."
