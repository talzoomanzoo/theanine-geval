Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods.\nSpeaker B: Oh that sounds fun! What is it about?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B expressed interest in trying healing methods mentioned by Speaker A, who enjoys salsa dancing and is planning to go out dancing. Speaker B enjoys bartending mainly for the fun aspect and the tips they receive, and works as a bartender, enjoying meeting different people.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's about Natasha Romanoff's past and how she confronts her demons.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY doesn't provide much relevant information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context primarily revolves around watching a movie and trying Brazilian food, whereas the MEMORY contains unrelated details about healing methods, salsa dancing, and bartending. While the memory may give some insight into Speaker B's interests and occupation, it does not directly aid in generating a response to Speaker B's question about the movie's content. The sentences are structured reasonably well and show some past interactions, but they aren't connected to the current topic, and therefore, aren't very helpful for this specific dialogue context."
