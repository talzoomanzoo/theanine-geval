Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\nSpeaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it.\nSpeaker A: Cool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot. What is your favorite part about camping?\nSpeaker B: I love being out in the wilderness and sleeping under the stars in the fresh air. It makes you realize how beautiful life is and how small we really are in comparison to the universe.\nSpeaker A: I miss doing that! I have done lots of picnics with my family but it's been a long time since I've slept in a tent! Looking forward to it again when the kids are older. Where was the last place you went?\nSpeaker B: We went up to an island in the middle of nowhere in Canada. There were lots of bears and huge moose!\nSpeaker A: Wow, that sounds like such an adventure! I love to visit Canada. I have seen moose but never a bear! That must have been scary!\nSpeaker B: Yes, it is quite scary. We could also hear the wolves howling at night, luckily we didn't come across them though. One thing to note about bears, is they just want to come and scrounge for our food, so we learned to safely pack it away and hang it up high in a tree.\nSpeaker A: Yes, I've heard that it's important to be careful in bear country! I would love to see one in person though. Do you take lots of photos on your trips?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B's involvement in the Boy Scouts has led Speaker A to appreciate it and invite Speaker B to a youth retreat. Speaker B, who has been part of the Boy Scouts for 7-8 years and is currently a Life Scout, is now desired by Speaker A to join a church retreat. Additionally, Speaker B, aiming to become an Eagle Scout, is considering taking vacation days from their busy schedule involving scouts, school, work, and tennis to attend the retreat suggested by Speaker A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I do take a lot of photos on my trips. It's great to capture those memories and share them with others.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information regarding Speaker B's involvement in Boy Scouts, such as their rank and years of participation. However, it lacks a clear connection to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which heavily focuses on camping experiences and surviving in the wilderness. Although there could be potential relevance regarding Speaker B's interest in joining a youth or church retreat, the MEMORY does not directly contribute helpful information that would aid in constructing the next response in the conversation. The details about Speaker Bâ€™s schedule and other unrelated factors (like school, work, and tennis) do not provide any useful contextual cues for the ongoing dialogue. The MEMORY falls short of a higher rating due to its weak connection to the specifics and direction of the conversation."
