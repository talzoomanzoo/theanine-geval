Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well?\nSpeaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes?\nSpeaker A: I want to take some martial art classes at school next year. What do you sggest I try?\nSpeaker B: I mean I always recommend Karate since that's what I study! I can bring you by the dojo sometime if you want to see what it is like. \nSpeaker A: OMG!! That would be so awesome, Yes please.  When is a good time for you?\nSpeaker B: Awesome! Tomorrow afternoon anytime between 3-6 would work for me!\nSpeaker A: Perfect. I will meet you at the Dojo at 3pm. I really appriciate it, and I will buy you lunch after too. \nSpeaker B: That's great! I can bring some guest passes to the pool I lifeguard at as well! I'm working this weekend if you want to come when I am working. Where do you want to eat?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has a background in football and karate, but is currently a lifeguard at the beach. They are considering a career change to the IT sector due to their computer skills and the growing demand for employees in that sector.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY offers some context that could be helpful for a language model to generate a response in this conversation. It provides background information on Speaker B, which includes their involvement in karate and life as a lifeguard â€“ both relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as they mention karate classes and guest passes to the pool where Speaker B works as a lifeguard. However, the mention of a career change to the IT sector is not directly relevant or needed in this particular context. The MEMORY does connect to the conversation but can include unnecessary elements that do not aid in generating immediate, relevant dialogue based on the given interaction."
