Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok? \nSpeaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish?\nSpeaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus!\nSpeaker B: Oh that sounds absolutely fabulous. Are you going to get a free dessert, as well?\nSpeaker A: Yes, I am thinking about trying either the new eclairs, or their tres leches cake with fresh raspberry jam sauce and lemon drizzle! I have too many good options to pick from! What one would you pick?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is interested in going rock climbing with Speaker A. Speaker A enjoys the interaction with people at work and the variety of experiences that come with it. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\nSpeaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit. Speaker A owns a restaurant and recently experienced a fire incident but managed to put it out. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy. Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule.\nSpeaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit, which causes Speaker A to enjoy the interaction with people at work and the variety of experiences that come with it. Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I would go for the tres leches cake with fresh raspberry jam sauce and lemon drizzle. It sounds like a delicious choice!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several details about Speaker A's work at the restaurant and their enjoyment in interacting with people and experiencing a variety of things. Some of this information is somewhat helpful as it connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A talks about dishes at the restaurant and being excited about them. However, the MEMORY is repetitive and scattered with details that are not directly relevant to the current dialogue, such as the fire incident and free meals per week, which do not aid in generating a contextual response. The repetition and disjointed nature of the MEMORY means that it's not very efficiently structured for using contextual cues to generate a proper response. Therefore, the score is closer to the lower end of the scale."
