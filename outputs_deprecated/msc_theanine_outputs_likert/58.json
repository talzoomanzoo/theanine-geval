Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\nSpeaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk?\nSpeaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous.\nSpeaker B: That sounds amazing! Did you bring a pet? I love doing the harder trails with my dog. Sometimes, it's very peaceful to get away from everything.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys reading fantasy books and recommends \"A Game of Thrones\" by George R. R. Martin. Speaker A also enjoyed reading 'Redwall' growing up and keeps an eye out for similar books. Speaker B enjoys reading the Odd Thomas and Dark Tower series and finds inspiration for their artwork during nature walks. Speaker A recommends the new album by Highly Suspect to Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I didn't bring a pet this time, but I can imagine how peaceful it must be to have a furry companion on the trail with you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about the interests of both speakers that could potentially be useful for generating a relevant response. However, it lacks direct relevance to the immediate DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is focused on nature walks and potentially bringing a pet along. The shared interest in reading and music doesn't connect directly to the topic of nature walks. While Speaker B's connection to nature walks as inspiration for artwork could be somewhat valuable, this aspect of the MEMORY is not well-developed or directly linked to the specific discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Consequently, the MEMORY is not highly beneficial for informing the dialogue further, but it contains some tidbits that might allow for introducing tangentially related topics, such as inspiration from walks or general interests."
