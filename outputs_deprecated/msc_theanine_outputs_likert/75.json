Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play? \nSpeaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music.\nSpeaker A: ah right, who's your favourite rock band?\nSpeaker B: I'm big fan of aerosmith. When do you learn music.

I have been playing drums since i was a kid, my father taught me when I was young and from then on I just taught myself\nSpeaker B: That's awesome! I have been trying to learn last one year. Still I didn't get right teacher. I'm jealous on you. I don't have like your dad.\nSpeaker A: what instrument have you been trying to learn?\nSpeaker B: Piano is my favorite instrument. When try play my mind was mesmerizing. How do you learn surfering?\nSpeaker A: I learnt to surf from one of my good friends, he surfed in a number of competitions and did very well. Would you like to learn to surf if you had more time?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I would like to learn surfing with my friends at weekend. But my friends didn't have interesting on surfing.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A, who grew up in California on the beach, loves morning surfing as a way to escape from daily life. Additionally, Speaker A is preoccupied with not dying when surfing. \nSpeaker B wishes they had time to go surfing and is considering getting lessons at a surf shop. Furthermore, Speaker B finds fishing easier than surfing but is interested in trying surfing, and is willing to teach Speaker A how to fish and cook. \nSpeaker A was good at writing in school, while Speaker B was bad at math and preferred fishing. Speaker B is looking forward to taking a break from work and going fishing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "You should definitely give surfing a try, even if your friends aren't interested. It's such a great way to relax and have fun in the water.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker A loves surfing and wants to escape daily life through it, which aligns with the conversation about learning to surf. It also indicates Speaker B's interest in trying surfing and their willingness to teach Speaker A fishing and cooking, which could be relevant in future interactions. However, much of the MEMORY is unrelated to the current conversation, such as Speaker A's writing skills or Speaker B's math abilities, and their fishing preferences. These details do not contribute to the progression of the current discussion about music and surfing and don't maintain a clear connection or causality related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. To achieve a higher score, the MEMORY would need to be more focused on the relevant aspects discussed in the exchange and maintain a natural structure that clearly outlines the development and connections between the conversations."
