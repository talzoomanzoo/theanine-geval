    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play? \nSpeaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music.\nSpeaker A: ah right, who's your favourite rock band?\nSpeaker B: I'm big fan of aerosmith. When do you learn music. Whom teach you?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys listening to Sublime a lot while relaxing on the beach and is looking forward to taking a break from work to go fishing. Speaker B also finds fishing easier than surfing but is interested in trying surfing, and is willing to teach Speaker A how to fish and cook.\n\nSpeaker A wants to see Sublime live one day but doesn't attend many concerts other than the ones their band plays in. Speaker A is in a band where they play the drums, write music, and have 4 members including the singer who is their best friend. Additionally, Speaker A is a musician.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly the fact that Speaker A is a musician and plays the drums in a band. This is relevant since Speaker B asked when Speaker A learned music. However, much of the other information in the MEMORY, such as Speaker B's interest in fishing and surfing or Speaker A's desire to see Sublime live, does not directly connect to the current conversation and does not aid in constructing a suitable next response. While the memories are phrased naturally, they do not significantly enhance the understanding of the development of interactions between the two speakers specifically related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Therefore, while some relevant details are present, the majority is not directly useful, resulting in a middle-range score."
