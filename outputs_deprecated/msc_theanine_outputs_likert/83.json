Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\nSpeaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call!\nSpeaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip? \nSpeaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery\nSpeaker B: Yes I think that's a great idea, how is work at the library? \nSpeaker A: Busy, and demanding because we are short staffed. While there seems to be little need for a library these days, I find that we have less staff to get everything done\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has a lot of kids, all grown up now and with kids of their own, which is why Speaker B mentions having grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park. This causes Speaker B to like the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature. \n\nSpeaker A is a librarian and loves kids, mentioning having 3 children. As a result, Speaker A is busy with work and unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. This also leads to Speaker A's other children being addicted to tablets and phones, unlike the youngest one who is interested in music.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds challenging, but it's wonderful that you're so dedicated to your work. Hopefully, things will improve soon at the library.",
    "prediction": "3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It offers insights into Speaker B's love for spending time with their grandkids and why they like the idea of an annual fishing trip, which connects to the conversation about family and spending time with grandkids. Additionally, it gives context about Speaker A's profession and challenges with work-life balance, which relates to the discussion of work at the library. However, the memory could be more cohesively structured. Some details, like the addiction of Speaker A's children to tablets and phones, are not directly relevant to the immediate dialogue context and may not significantly aid in generating a focused response. Overall, while the MEMORY contains relevant information that helps contextualize the conversation, it could be better organized to enhance its usefulness."
