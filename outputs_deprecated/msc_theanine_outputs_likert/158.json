Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it!\nSpeaker B: I'm glad you liked it. My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to?\nSpeaker A: I recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca. It was super cute and made me want to go visit Italy, but that was too expensive, so instead I booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month. What about you?\nSpeaker B: I have been relaxing with the kids as much as I have. My husband has been busy with work, so we haven't had time for anything big. I would love to visit Italy some day though if we get the chance. Have you ever been to Italy before?\nSpeaker A: I have never gone to Italy because I'm always so busy. If I ever go, I would want to spend a month there, but work has been hectic lately. Would your kids go with you if you went to Italy?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys watching movies with her kids, which is why Speaker B's kids enjoy watching Disney movies, which Speaker B also finds good. This made Speaker A watch the Disney movie 'Luca' recently. \n\nSpeaker B is a stay-at-home mom who used to prefer romance and horror movies, but now her kids enjoy watching movies like 'Luca' which they find good. \n\nSpeaker B enjoys watching movies with her kids, and because of this, her kids enjoy watching Disney movies, which Speaker B also finds good. This is evident from the fact that 'Miracle' and 'Remember the Titans' are available on Disney Plus.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant context to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT in terms of Speaker B's preference for Disney movies and enjoying watching them with her kids. This information could be helpful for generating responses related to movies or family activities. However, the MEMORY lacks deeper development or causality between the sentences. The mention of \"Miracle\" and the availability of \"Remember the Titans\" on Disney Plus doesn't contribute significantly to the flow of the conversation, nor does it assist in generating further dialogue effectively. Overall, while MEMORY contains some connections to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, it lacks coherence and depth, limiting its help in generating a nuanced next response."
