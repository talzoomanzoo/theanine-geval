Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it!\nSpeaker B: I'm glad you liked it. My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to?\nSpeaker A: I recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca. It was super cute and made me want to go visit Italy, but that was too expensive, so instead I booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month. What about you?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys watching Disney movies with her kids, which Speaker A recently experienced when watching the movie 'Luca'. \nSpeaker B, a stay-at-home mom, used to prefer romance and horror movies, but now enjoys watching Disney movies with her kids, who loved 'Luca'. \nSpeaker A and Speaker B both enjoy discussing movies, with Speaker B recommending 'Miracle' to Speaker A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds amazing! I've never been to Hawaii, but I'm sure it'll be a beautiful experience. As for me, just staying busy with the kids and enjoying some family time.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a proper response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It clearly establishes that Speaker B enjoys watching Disney movies with her kids, which is relevant when discussing 'Luca' and 'Miracle'. It also indicates that Speaker B used to enjoy romance and horror movies, which may lead to more personalized recommendations or discussions. Furthermore, MEMORY states that Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy discussing movies, aligning with the ongoing conversation about movies in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While the MEMORY could be structured to emphasize past interactions more clearly, it provides sufficient contextual cues and is naturally phrased, earning a score of 4."
