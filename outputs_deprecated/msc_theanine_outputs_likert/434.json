Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\nSpeaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it.\nSpeaker A: Cool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot. What is your favorite part about camping?\nSpeaker B: I love being out in the wilderness and sleeping under the stars in the fresh air. It makes you realize how beautiful life is and how small we really are in comparison to the universe.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B's involvement with the scout troop and work at a fast food place causes Speaker A to appreciate it and invite them to a youth retreat. This leads Speaker B, who has been in Boy Scouts for 7-8 years and is currently a Life Scout, to consider attending the retreat. On the other hand, Speaker A's church activities and mention of a church retreat prompt Speaker B, who is busy with scouts, school, work, and tennis, to be willing to take vacation days for the retreat. This also leads Speaker B to contemplate attending a local community college for the first couple of years.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds so peaceful and grounding. I can see why you enjoy it so much. Do you have any memorable camping stories you could share?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful context about Speaker B's background and activities, which can be beneficial for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights Speaker B's long-term involvement with the Boy Scouts, which is relevant to the current conversation about Boy Scouts and survival skills. Additionally, it mentions Speaker B's commitment to scouts and other activities, such as work and tennis, which could be used to inform the tone and depth of the conversation. However, the MEMORY contains a lot of extraneous information that doesn't directly relate to the specific topic of the dialogue context, such as the church activities and the community college consideration. While these details are nicely connected within the memory, they do not enhance the language model's ability to generate a contextually relevant response in this immediate dialogue about survival skills and camping. Hence, the MEMORY is moderately helpful in this context."
