    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships!\nSpeaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!   I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field?\nSpeaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate?\nSpeaker B: I have another year- so this year is really important I get internships and start making connections in the field.   I love going to the beach too.  What happened with your knees that now cause you so much pain?\nSpeaker A: I think age has really been my knees downfall. I also used to hike a lot and I put a lot of pressure on my legs. That is great that you only have a year. Maybe when you graduate you can come hang out on the beach with me. I can't surf but I would love to watch you.\nSpeaker B: That would be fun!  I like collecting shells too so we could do that as well.  I have a small collection of ones I have from around the world.  The farthest away was from Greece.  Have you traveled a lot?\nSpeaker A: I have. I love Europe. I have been to many countries there but I have not gone to Greece yet. I would love to. The scenery and architecture is amazing. Have you gotten to visit other European countries?\nSpeaker B: I have.   I have also been to France and Ireland.  Where have you been in Europe?\nSpeaker A: Oh gosh. I have been to France, England, Ireland, Switzerland, Austria, Poland, Germany, Leichenstein, Spain, and much of Mexico, and Bermuda. I just love to travel but I have not been able to recently and with my knees I cannot sit in coach anymore and first class is so expensive. Do you plan on settling any place in particular once you graduate? \nSpeaker B: That's awesome you have been so many places!   I  am not sure where I will setlle down after graduation.  It probably will depend whether I decide to go further in my education or not and I have any residency requirements with that.   I do like the heat though so  hopefully somewhere sunny!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B's interest in sports medicine and surfing has changed from being solely focused on playing soccer with other students to seeking internships in the sports medicine field and collecting shells at the beach. Speaker A is providing advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field. \n\nSpeaker B's interest in sports medicine and surfing has been influenced by the fact that their mother runs a local high school, and Speaker B is her only child. This has led Speaker B to study sports medicine, play soccer, and aspire to join their college team in the future. \n\nSpeaker A's retirement has led them to enjoy hiking along the coast, collecting shells, and mentioning that their knees can't handle much else.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Somewhere sunny sounds perfect for your love of surfing and sports medicine. It's great to keep your options open for now. Have you considered any specific locations yet?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some information that could be helpful for generating the next response, but it also has some issues. It does capture some aspects of Speaker B's interest in sports medicine and their transition towards seeking internships, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B talks about the importance of internships. However, it introduces new information that wasn't present in the dialogue, such as Speaker B's mother running a local high school and being an only child. This information is not directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT and may confuse rather than assist in generating the next response. Additionally, the MEMORY mentions Speaker A's enjoyment of collecting shells, which ties into the conversation about the beach, but it does not clarify Speaker A's current focus on hanging out at the beach due to knee issues as stated in the context. Overall, while there are connections to the context, the MEMORY includes extraneous or new information that lacks direct relevance or clear development from the dialogue."
