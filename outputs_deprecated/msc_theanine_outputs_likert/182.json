Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know. \nSpeaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like.\nSpeaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too.\nSpeaker B: Nice! Is anyone coming with you?\nSpeaker A: Just my doggy Drunky.  You never know,  I might meet a nice lady out there. \nSpeaker B: Totally.  There will be a bunch of women there and it'll be easy to strike up conversations.  Just be confident and I'm sure you could walk away with a bunch of numbers.\nSpeaker A: Oh, I definitely will. Thanks for the motivation. Is this going to me your first festival?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys Mexican food and drinks, and plays music for fun. Speaker A enjoys going to bars and loves the ladies. Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n\nSpeaker B is a mechanic who enjoys working on cars. Speaker B is not going out drinking much due to their wife's pregnancy. Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day. Speaker B's wife is pregnant and has three more months to go until the due date.\n\nSpeaker A owns a Subaru Legacy and mentions having a baby on the way. Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "No, I've been to a few festivals before, but this will be the first one with a baby on the way.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a moderate amount of helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures important contextual cues such as Speaker B's wife's pregnancy, allowing Speaker A to possibly understand Speaker B's situation and the offer to use the cabin. It also mentions both speakers' shared interest in bluegrass music, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about attending a bluegrass show and festival. However, the MEMORY could be more helpful if it included more details specifically about their connection or past experiences with bluegrass festivals. Some parts of the MEMORY about Speaker A's preferences like Mexican food and bars, while naturally phrased, are less relevant to the immediate context. Overall, the MEMORY presents relevant interactions but could be more focused on aiding the generation of a directly relevant and contextually rich next response."
