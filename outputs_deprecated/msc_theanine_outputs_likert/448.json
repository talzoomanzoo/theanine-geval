Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast.\nSpeaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project.\nSpeaker A: Quite a few, but it wasn't too crowded. It was a nice change of scenery. What kind of project are you working on?\nSpeaker B: I'm sure the student appreciate that. You teach as a group as apposed to one-on-one right? And one of the companies I work for had their system hit with a virus so I've been upgraded their software to debug the system.\nSpeaker A: I teach group classes and one on one, but I was the student today. I specialize in jiu-jitsu but today I got to be the student in a taekwondo class. \nSpeaker B: That's even better, learning is a life-long journey. How are you class on martial art history? When you have time teach me too, I'd love to learn. \nSpeaker A: It's been a little stressful lately, because finals are coming up...but I'm confident in that class. I could've aced it before I even started! I'll definitely get started with you after finals.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is a college student who teaches jiu-jitsu and is lactose intolerant. Today, however, Speaker A is a student in a taekwondo class and is enjoying the change of scenery. \nSpeaker A is planning to take summer courses soon and is very active, enjoying martial arts. In addition, Speaker A is enrolled in a class on the history of martial arts and is majoring in athletic training. Both Speaker A and Speaker B are interested in martial arts and enjoy learning new things.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains relevant details that link back to the dialogue, such as Speaker A's background in teaching jiu-jitsu and being a student in a taekwondo class. This directly ties to the recent class experience discussed in the context. Additionally, it mentions Speaker A's interest in martial arts and their enrollment in a martial arts history class, which align with their ongoing conversation about learning martial arts and Speaker B's interest in being taught by Speaker A.\n\nThe MEMORY captures the interest both speakers have in martial arts and highlights Speaker A's academic pursuits in athletic training, offering a wider context for possible future interactions about their teaching and learning experiences. However, the part about Speaker A's lactose intolerance is not particularly relevant to the current dialogue, slightly lowering the score from a perfect 5. Overall, the MEMORY provides a solid framework for a language model to continue the conversation meaningfully."
