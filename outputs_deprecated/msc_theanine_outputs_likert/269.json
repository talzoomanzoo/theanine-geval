Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go?\nSpeaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \nSpeaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on?\nSpeaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study?\nSpeaker B: Ah, English should be easier than History. Sure, I can help you. What do you need to do exactly? Write an essay?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is studying sports medicine in college, while Speaker A hopes to improve their grades and aims for a soccer scholarship. Speaker A excels only in gym class despite struggling with maintaining good grades. \nSpeaker B and Speaker A both discuss their challenges in school, with Speaker A finding history boring and Speaker B feeling overwhelmed by their strict mother. \nSpeaker B, who plays soccer and has no siblings, shares the same goal as Speaker A in wanting to improve grades and aiming for a soccer scholarship. Speaker A excels only in gym class despite their academic struggles.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks, I appreciate your help. Yeah, we have to analyze some poems and write an essay.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides somewhat useful context for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as it highlights both speakers' challenges and goals regarding school and grades. Both Speaker A and B's aspirations for a soccer scholarship and Speaker B's support for Speaker A through their academic struggles add depth to Speaker B's willingness to help Speaker A with studying. However, the MEMORY could benefit from more directly related information to the specific conversation about exams and studying strategies that are immediately relevant to the dialogue context. Instead, it mentions broader academic struggles and Speaker B's family dynamics that are not directly connected to the ongoing conversation about finals and studying. Thus, while the MEMORY provides some context, it could be more tightly aligned with the dialogue context to maximize its helpfulness."
