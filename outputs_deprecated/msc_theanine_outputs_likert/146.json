Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?\nSpeaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping?\nSpeaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp?\nSpeaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is away from their child and glad that the pets are with them. Speaker B expresses concern about leaving a kitten alone during their family camping adventures. Speaker B is considering calling in sick to work to go to the zoo with their child. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo. \n\nSpeaker A suggests taking the pets to the zoo and mentions that most major cities have good zoos. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities. Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys. Speaker A has a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo, particularly to see the tiger named Joshua.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provided does include some information that could be helpful in generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context is focused on camping and Speaker B's family trip, while the MEMORY contains information about Speaker B's concern for pets when away and activities like potentially going to the zoo with their child. The MEMORY lacks any direct mentioning of camping, except for the tangential link between being away for a camping trip and worrying about the kitten. Furthermore, Speaker Aâ€™s enjoyment of zoos and their familiarity with big cities doesn't directly align with the current topic. However, the MEMORY does establish that both speakers have a shared interest in animals, which can potentially guide the language model to generate responses incorporating this mutual interest.\n\nWhile the MEMORY does not have strong direct connections to the question of favorite camping spots or methods of camping, it is not entirely irrelevant either due to the theme of family activities and interests. Therefore, the rating of 3 reflects the MEMORY being somewhat helpful but not precisely aligned or directly relevant to the dialogue context."
