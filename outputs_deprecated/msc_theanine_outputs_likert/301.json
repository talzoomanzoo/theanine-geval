Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods.\nSpeaker B: Oh that sounds fun! What is it about?\nSpeaker A: Black Widow is one of the character in the Marvel Avengers movies. Like Thor and Captain America. Have you seen any of those movies?\nSpeaker B: No I haven't seen any of those. What foods did you eat while watching the movie?\nSpeaker A: Wow, there are so many of the movies out there. Don't go see Black Widow without watching Avengers first. I had an amazing steak and vegetables on the side that were delicious. What is you favorite food? \nSpeaker B: Oh ok I definitely will watch those first! I love both steak and vegetables! I am a real foodie and love just about everything that isn't too strange to try lol.\nSpeaker A: Oh wow! Do you like sushi? I love it but the sea urchin is a little crazy lol. Have you ever eaten sea urchin?\n\nMEMORY:\n- Speaker B expressed interest in trying healing methods mentioned by Speaker A. Speaker A and their brother enjoy going to a Brazilian steakhouse for dinner. Speaker B has one sibling, a little brother. Speaker A's brother enjoys Brazilian food, specifically steak.\n- Speaker B expressed interest in trying healing methods mentioned by Speaker A. Speaker A and their brother enjoy going to a Brazilian steakhouse for dinner.

Speaker A plans to grab dinner with their brother before dancing. Speaker A is planning to take their clients salsa dancing for fun.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I do enjoy sushi, but I haven't tried sea urchin yet. Maybe I'll have to be adventurous like you and give it a shot!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some limited context about Speaker B and Speaker A's personal lives and preferences, such as their family structures, dining preferences, and minor activities. However, it does not specifically address or provide direct cues related to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which primarily revolves around the Black Widow movie experience and associated food experiences. The sentences do not naturally lead to insights directly relevant to the ongoing conversation about movies and specific food experiences. The MEMORY lacks clear reference to or development of these recent interactions, making it challenging for a language model to generate the next response seamlessly based on the provided memory. Therefore, while the MEMORY contains somewhat structured sentences, the relevance and helpfulness to the current dialogue are not fully realized."
