Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go?\nSpeaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \nSpeaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on?\nSpeaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is excelling in the sports medicine class, causing Speaker A to struggle with maintaining good grades and only excel in gym.\nSpeaker B and Speaker A both find history class boring and overwhelming, with Speaker B eager to finish school to escape their mother's strictness.\nSpeaker B is pressured to maintain straight A's in sports medicine to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided offers some context about Speaker B's life, specifically highlighting the pressure they're under to maintain straight A's in sports medicine and their eagerness to escape school and their mother's strictness. However, this information is not directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT nor does it aid in generating a proper next response. \n\nThe MEMORY mentions that both speakers find history class overwhelming, which could slightly connect to the dialogue snippet where they discuss exams, but this connection is quite weak and not directly useful for Speaker B's response. The rest of the information does not provide any helpful cues for responding to Speaker A's queries about exams or study help. \n\nThe MEMORY doesn't clearly demonstrate the development or causality of the conversations between the speakers. It lacks naturally structured sentences that directly tie into the current dialogue context, and crucially, it doesn't offer insights into how Speaker B might respond to Speaker A's request for help studying for their English final. Instead, the MEMORY is more focused on the academic background of both speakers without relevance or application to the immediate dialogue."
