Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive.\nSpeaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price?\nSpeaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music\nSpeaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it.\nSpeaker A: I'll keep trying! Have you had any luck lately?\nSpeaker B: No I haven't! I keep hoping that I will so I can buy my dreamhouse but I know the chances are low.\nSpeaker A: Would you move to the city? It'd be too much for me\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A, who was born and raised as a preacher's kid in the country and worked on a produce farm, mentions that Speaker B's kids could try milking cows on the farm, which Speaker B finds amusing. They then discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\n\nSpeaker A and Speaker B have a friendly interaction and part ways on a positive note after both buying lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n\nSpeaker A, who was born and raised as a preacher's kid in the country and worked on a produce farm, expresses interest in potentially moving out of the city and enjoying a more peaceful life on the farm. Speaker B is open to moving to the country to be further away from neighbors and buys 20 lotto tickets with the same numbers, aiming to get a bigger share of the jackpot if they win.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "I can understand that. I actually prefer the peace and quiet of the countryside myself.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant background information that could be helpful for Speaker B in generating a response. It contains details about Speaker A's background, including being raised as a preacher's kid and working on a produce farm, which can help understand Speaker A's perspective on moving to the country. It also mentions the friendly interaction between the two speakers and their mutual interest in the lotto, which aligns with the current conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY effectively connects with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT by highlighting the ongoing lottery discussions and Speaker A's interest in moving out of the city, which relates to their conversation about buying a \"dreamhouse\" and potentially moving to the city. The structure of the MEMORY presents a clear development of past interactions and themes relevant to both speakers, making it helpful for generating a contextually appropriate response."
