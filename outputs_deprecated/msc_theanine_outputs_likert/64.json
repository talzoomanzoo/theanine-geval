    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\nSpeaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk?\nSpeaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous.\nSpeaker B: That sounds amazing! Did you bring a pet? I love doing the harder trails with my dog. Sometimes, it's very peaceful to get away from everything.\nSpeaker A: No, I don't have any pets; my apartment seems too small for a dog and I would worry about them being lonely all day when I'm at work. I was thinking about getting a pair of cats, but I haven't committed yet. How nice fo ryou to have company when you're walking though! What kind of dog do you have?\nSpeaker B: Cats can be nice! I used to have cats, but am allergic to them and had to give them to my friend. I have an Australian Kelpie who is a rescue. She is very energetic and smart!\nSpeaker A: I had cats as a child and I think that they're a bit easier to care for than dogs, especially in the city. I am a dog lover as well though; Australian Kelpies are gorgeous! What is her name? Does she walk well off-leash?\nSpeaker B: Yes, cats are very smart and clean. Mine used to bring me a mouse to throw for her, just like a dog! And if you have 2 cats, they play with each other! Mine would run up and down the halls in the middle of the night, haha. Her name is Kyrie, and she walks off leash and is very obedient. Dogs might be hard to keep in your small apartment though, since Kyrie likes to play in the field, run with cars along the fence row, and herd goats. \nSpeaker A: Oh wow! So Kyrie is a working dog? She helps your dad out on the farm?\nSpeaker B: She herds them for fun, haha. Goats mostly graze wherever they like in the fields, but she likes to group them up and walk them into a pen. My grandpa says it's from her cattle herding heritage.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B and Speaker A both have a love for nature and animals. Speaker A also shares a passion for reading fantasy books like \"A Game of Thrones\" and enjoys audiobooks. Speaker B, on the other hand, is an artist who incorporates nature into their work and is interested in Pilates but dislikes strict exercise routines. Speaker A, a city dweller, walks to work and stresses the significance of maintaining proper form during exercise to avoid injuries.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Kyrie sounds like a fascinating dog with a strong instinct for herding! It must be entertaining to watch her in action.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some information about Speaker A and Speaker B's interests, such as Speaker A's love for reading and Speaker B's interest in art and Pilates. However, it lacks direct relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on nature walks, dogs, and potential pet ownership. The MEMORY could be helpful if it contained more specific details related to these topics, such as previous conversations about nature, pets, or outdoor activities. The current MEMORY is somewhat generalized and does not provide significant cues for generating a meaningful continuation of the dialogue based on the current context. While it is structured naturally, the information is not highly relevant to the current conversation."
