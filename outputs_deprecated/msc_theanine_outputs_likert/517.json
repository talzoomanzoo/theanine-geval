    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well?\nSpeaker B: The older one seems to like it while the youngest cannot be bothered. Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon?\nSpeaker A: Yes!  As a matter of fact, I'm visiting my son that lives in Spain next month.  This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now!\nSpeaker B: Oh nice. You must be looking forward to it. He must have told you a lot about her. Do you think you would like her?\nSpeaker A: I think so.  She seems like a very sweet girl and she seems to care deeply about my son, so that's what matters most.  You know, maybe I can stop by and visit you as well, since you live in Europe.  France, Spain, Italy?  Where are you living now?\nSpeaker B: Bless her, that's good to hear. That would be great! I live in Portugal. It's not too far from Spain. We can always arrange something. How long would you be there for?\nSpeaker A: I'm planning to stay in Spain for three weeks.  Since you live in Portugal, I'd love to stop by for a visit if you're free this coming month.  I've always wanted to visit Lisbon.  It has the world's longest bridge!\nSpeaker B: That'a great idea. We have a holiday house just outside of Lisbon. You are welcome to lodge with us.\nSpeaker A: Sounds great!  I'm already very excited about my trip to Spain, and now I get to visit you in Lisbon!  I need to brush up on my Spanish and also start studying Portuguese.\nSpeaker B: Haha, you've got your hands full then. Portuguese would be easier I believe. Spanish is a bit harder because it is spoken quicker. Would you be travelling with any company?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has two sons who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next. Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe.\nSpeaker A has multiple sons, at least one of them is in a relationship with a Spanish girlfriend. Speaker B has two sons, one of whom has had a girlfriend for several years and the other is secretive. \nSpeaker B's younger son would be jealous of Speaker A's sons' European tour. Speaker B's sons would possibly get along well with Speaker A's sons.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker A has multiple sons with one in a relationship with a Spanish girlfriend, which correlates with their upcoming travel to Spain to meet the son's girlfriend. Similarly, it touches on Speaker A visiting Europe and their connection to the continent, which aligns with travel plans discussed. However, the MEMORY includes details about Speaker B's sons that are not particularly relevant to the current context, such as relationships that have not been mentioned, which may introduce unnecessary information. Additionally, some references, like jealousy and potential camaraderie between the sons, do not directly contribute to progressing the conversation about Speaker A's visit to Europe and possibly meeting Speaker B. While it provides context on travel and relationships, it could be structured or aligned more directly with the ongoing conversation for increased helpfulness."
