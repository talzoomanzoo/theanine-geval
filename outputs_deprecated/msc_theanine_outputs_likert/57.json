Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\nSpeaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk?\nSpeaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Speaker B, who lives in the country and loves nature, is currently re-reading 'Redwall' by Brian Jacques, a favorite book from their childhood. This has been hindered by their new painting project, which has been keeping them busy and away from reading. Speaker B prefers silence while reading and creating artwork to stay focused.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "The river trail sounds lovely. I always enjoy being near the water.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some contextual information about Speaker B's interests and lifestyle, such as living in the country, loving nature, re-reading \"Redwall,\" and being busy with a painting project. However, these details are not particularly helpful or directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about the nature walk that Speaker A went on. The MEMORY does not provide any useful connections, causality, or development between Speaker A and Speaker B that would assist in generating a relevant next response. Furthermore, the sentences in the MEMORY do not naturally relate to the ongoing conversation about hiking trails and nature walks, which diminishes its helpfulness in this specific dialogue situation."
