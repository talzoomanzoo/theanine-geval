Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play? \nSpeaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music.\nSpeaker A: ah right, who's your favourite rock band?\nSpeaker B: I'm big fan of aerosmith. When do you learn music. Whom teach you?\nSpeaker A: aerosmith are great, have you ever seen them live? I have been playing drums since i was a kid, my father taught me when I was young and from then on I just taught myself\nSpeaker B: That's awesome! I have been trying to learn last one year. Still I didn't get right teacher. I'm jealous on you. I don't have like your dad.\nSpeaker A: what instrument have you been trying to learn?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys playing the drums and writing music in a band, which consists of 4 members including their best friend who is the singer. This has led Speaker A to plan a concert in Denver and they have offered to get tickets for Speaker B. \nSpeaker B, on the other hand, is a passionate cook who loves making Italian dishes such as pasta, risotto, and pizza.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides limited helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context primarily revolves around Speaker B's experience with music, while the MEMORY talks about Speaker A's interest in playing drums, having a band, and planning a concertâ€”providing some indirect context about Speaker A's music background. However, the concert in Denver and the offer to get tickets for Speaker B is not directly related to the immediate context of learning and playing instruments. Additionally, while the information about Speaker B being a passionate cook is completely unrelated to the music-based dialogue context, it is naturally phrased. Overall, the MEMORY lacks strong causality and development of past interactions that would help generate a more context-relevant response."
