Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A, being an inventor fascinated with teleportation and currently developing a time machine, used to foster puppies but now focuses on caring for dogs and cats at the animal shelter, especially enjoying the arrival of new puppies.\n   \n2. Speaker A's passion for science contrasts with Speaker B's love for music, particularly Black Sabbath, and grilling meat. This has led Speaker B to get involved in volunteering and show a preference for cats, especially kittens, over dogs.\n\n3. Speaker A, an animal lover who adores puppies and frequently visits shelters during their teleportation travels, is now primarily involved in caring for dogs and cats at the shelter, experiencing joy when new puppies arrive.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some helpful context for understanding Speaker A's enthusiasm for the arrival of a new cat and their general preference for dogs and puppies. Sentences 1 and 3 establish Speaker A's background as an animal lover who enjoys puppies and is involved in animal shelter activities, which are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. These details help provide context for Speaker A's statement in the dialogue. Sentence 2, however, introduces Speaker B's contrasting interests in music and grilling, which do not directly relate to the dialogue about a new cat at the shelter and provide minimal relevance to generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, while the MEMORY does provide some useful background, it lacks a clear structure and focus on directly relevant information to merit a higher score."
