    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week?\nSpeaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you?\nSpeaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions?\nSpeaker B: Unfortunately I mainly play games similar to RE. I don't know why I like them so much. I remember when I was little my brother play Doom and it gave me nightmares for a week. What genre of games you like?\nSpeaker A: I like all kinds of games. I like party, fighting, RPGs, shooters, action, adventure, and puzzle games. I enjoy playing Jurassic Park: World but I'd like to find another game to play. The storm means I'll be inside for a bit, so I think I'll curl up with some pizza and just zone out. Do you like to do anything else besides game when it's rainy?\nSpeaker B: Well, I might help around the house with cleaning or laundry, but not that much. Mostly gaming. If I feel I sat too long, I'll switch to Nintendo Switch's Ring Fit Adventure to get my body moving a bit. Do yo know that game?\nSpeaker A: I've heard of it. I think I need to get some exercise, so that might be a good idea. I'd like to stay in shape as much as I can. I guess games are the best way to do that! That's a good suggestion. How about you? Do you only like games like RE? What other genres do you like?\nSpeaker B: I like fighting too, but not RPG types. I tried racing games before, but clearly not good at it so I'm not enjoying them that much. \nSpeaker A: Maybe when you get the chance, we should play an online game together. I'm not a competitive person. I mainly play games for fun and I don't care if I win or lose. What do you think?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A prefers tamer video games and is not a fan of horror movies. Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both enjoy playing video games in their free time. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\nSpeaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII. Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World. Speaker A enjoys playing the Jurassic Park game but mentions its lack of multiplayer and outdated graphics.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds great! I'm up for playing some online games together. Winning or losing doesn't matter to me either, as long as we're having a good time. Let's pick something we both enjoy.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information about the game's preferences and conversations of both Speaker A and Speaker B. However, the structure is not very cohesive, and some sentences feel repetitive. For instance, the mention of Speaker A hesitating to try Resident Evil is repeated in different forms, and there is no mention of the other genres Speaker B likes or their intention to play games together online, missing important details from the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY also doesn't clearly highlight the connection or development of their gaming interests in other areas discussed in the dialogue, which could have provided further helpful context for generating a proper response. The lack of diversity in presented information and repetitiveness of the details makes it somewhat helpful but lacking in providing a complete picture."
