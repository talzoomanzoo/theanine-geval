Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys reading fantasy books and recommends \"A Game of Thrones\" by George R because Speaker A also enjoyed reading 'Redwall' growing up and keeps an eye out for similar books. \nSpeaker B is an artist who walks through nature for work and finds inspiration for their artwork during nature walks. Speaker B lives in the country, loves nature, and works with animals. Speaker B is interested in Pilates but dislikes the idea of having to follow specific steps in exercise.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds wonderful! I always find so much inspiration in nature.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY is quite helpful in generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context involves Speaker A talking about a nature walk they think Speaker B would like. The MEMORY provides relevant information about Speaker B's interest in nature and how they derive inspiration for their artwork during nature walks. This directly connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, suggesting that Speaker B would indeed be interested in the nature walk. Additionally, the MEMORY includes information about Speaker B living in the country, loving nature, and working with animals, which further aligns with the context. The information about Speaker Aâ€™s interest in fantasy books does not relate to the current dialogue, but it is phrased naturally and distinguishes it as unrelated, allowing a language model to easily focus on the nature-related context. Overall, the MEMORY effectively describes the connection and relevance of nature walks to Speaker B, helping facilitate a coherent and meaningful response in the conversation."
