    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well?\nSpeaker B: The older one seems to like it while the youngest cannot be bothered. Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A loves spending time with his sons, who have been out of town for a while and are leaving again in a few months. His boys will be coming for winter break from Europe. Speaker A's younger son would be jealous of Speaker B's sons' European tour, as the youngest one is addicted to social media and video games. Speaker A's sons play video games and listen to music in their rooms. Additionally, Speaker A has two sons who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next. At least one of Speaker A's sons is in a relationship with a Spanish girlfriend, while the other is secretive and possibly gay.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I can't wait to see them during winter break!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a fair amount of relevant information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It explains that Speaker A's sons have been abroad and are returning for winter break, which is pertinent since Speaker B asked about visiting them soon. It also informs us about the sons' interests, such as video games and music, which might connect with potential topics in the conversation. Additionally, the mention of the sons studying abroad in Spain and moving to Italy provides context for their current situation and travel plans. Although some details (e.g., relationship status) are not directly relevant to the immediate conversation, the overall MEMORY is well-structured and provides contextual cues beneficial for generating a response."
