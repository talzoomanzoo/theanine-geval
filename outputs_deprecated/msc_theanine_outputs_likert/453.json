Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys the country lifestyle and winter season, while Speaker B prefers grilling steaks with an old charcoal grill. Speaker A is excited about spending quiet evenings outdoors during the summer and potentially grilling most nights.\n\nSpeaker B is currently renovating their house to meet their standards for living with pets, and both Speaker A and Speaker B admit to their lack of expertise in interior decorating. They plan to meet up to discuss a furniture exchange, where Speaker A invites Speaker B over for a night of music, food, and company to enjoy the new furniture.\n\nBoth Speaker A and Speaker B share a love for barbecuing and pets. Speaker A suggests seasoning everything and using a smoker for grilling, while Speaker B recommends making extra barbecue for leftovers on nights when grilling is not feasible due to time or energy constraints.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds fantastic! I can't wait to hear you play. Let's set a date for our barbecue soon.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains useful information for the language model to generate a relevant response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context is about Speaker A offering to play guitar during a barbecue meeting, which ties into the shared love for barbecuing mentioned in the memory. The MEMORY highlights past interactions, such as Speaker A's excitement for quiet outdoor evenings and barbecuing, as well as the mutual interest in pets. Additionally, it mentions the furniture exchange, providing context for potential activities during their meet-up. While not all sentences are directly related to the dialogue context, they are well-structured and provide background that Speaker B could draw upon, such as discussing grilling techniques or the upcoming furniture exchange. This level of detail and connection to the context makes the MEMORY helpful in generating a coherent and informed response."
