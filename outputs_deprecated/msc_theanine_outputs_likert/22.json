    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, a high school student preparing for college, works at a diner at night but is considering giving up their job to focus on lab work and school. Additionally, Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, displaying an interest in neuroscience. Speaker A offers to take Sparky for a walk to help out and spend time with the dog, as Speaker B's dog is deaf and needs to be kept on a lead due to recall difficulties.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Definitely! I'm looking forward to seeing how the cloning process unfolds.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information about Speaker B's current situation and future plans, which aids in understanding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It helps establish Speaker B's interest in lab work and the personal decisions they may be contemplating regarding their current job at the diner. This information directly connects to Speaker A's inquiry about cloning the cow and Speaker B's plans, helping to generate a suitable response based on Speaker B's interests and challenges. Additionally, the mention of Speaker B's deaf dog, Sparky, which Speaker A offers to walk, gives additional context about their relationship and interactions, allowing for an understanding of the support Speaker A offers to Speaker B. These elements collectively inform and enrich the context for potential responses, though the memory could be more directly connected to the specific event of cloning the cow for a perfect score."
