Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go?\nSpeaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is studying sports medicine in college and has been consistently receiving A's in the class, feeling pressured to maintain good grades to avoid embarrassing their mother who is in charge of the school.\n   \n2. Speaker B, who is pursuing sports medicine in college, shares a common struggle with Speaker A who finds history class boring. Speaker B is overwhelmed by their mother's strictness and looks forward to completing school to escape the pressure.\n\n3. Speaker A believes that sports can demonstrate equality among all individuals, while Speaker B, who is training in sports medicine, is under pressure to excel academically to avoid upsetting their mother who is in charge of the school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great that you only have one more final left to go. You must be looking forward to finishing up the semester.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information regarding Speaker B's academic situation, such as their studies in sports medicine, their pressure to maintain good grades, and the influence of their mother who is involved with the school. While not all details are directly related to the current dialogue context, which revolves primarily around exams and studying, the MEMORY provides context to Speaker B's academic stress and pressure, helping a language model generate responses with an understanding of why Speaker B might feel pressured about finals. However, the information about Speaker A finding history class boring or their belief about sports demonstrating equality is not directly referenced in the context, though it helps flesh out the speakers' relationship. Overall, the MEMORY is helpful, but there is a lingering sense of extra details that could potentially distract from the main context conversation without contributing directly."
