Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok? \nSpeaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish?\nSpeaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus!\nSpeaker B: Oh that sounds absolutely fabulous. Are you going to get a free dessert, as well?\nSpeaker A: Yes, I am thinking about trying either the new eclairs, or their tres leches cake with fresh raspberry jam sauce and lemon drizzle! I have too many good options to pick from! What one would you pick?\nSpeaker B: Hands down, I would pick the tres leches. Ever since I tried it a few years ago, it has always been my favorite dessert.\nSpeaker A: Okay, I will try that! I've heard the can be made with different fruits. Did you have fruit with yours?\nSpeaker B: I like it best with fresh strawberries. And then it is even better with some fresh whipped cream and chocolate drizzle. Just thinking about it is making me want to have some right now!\nSpeaker A: Ooh, that sounds delicious! It's a rich and moist cake, so I don't think it should have too much chocolate. I've seen brown sugar and caramel versions too!\nSpeaker B: Oh I've never seen that version. That sounds scrumptuous. Tonight I'm going to bake some oatmeal raisin cookies.\nSpeaker A: That sounds great! I love a good oatmeal raisin cookie with the right amount of cinnamon! My brothers don't like them though, haha. They call them the \"vegetable of cookies\" :)\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is interested in going rock climbing with Speaker A. Speaker A enjoys the interaction with people at work and the variety of experiences that come with it. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\nSpeaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit. Speaker A owns a restaurant and recently experienced a fire incident but managed to put it out. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy. Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Haha, that's a funny way to describe oatmeal raisin cookies! Everyone has their own tastes.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that can be useful for generating the next response in the dialogue context. Specifically, it mentions that Speaker A works at a restaurant, enjoys working there, and gets free meals, which aligns with the conversation about trying new dishes at the restaurant. However, the MEMORY contains some sentences that seem contradictory or less relevant, such as owning a restaurant versus working in one, and an unrelated detail about a fire incident. These inconsistencies make it a bit difficult to fully grasp the past interactions between the speakers, impacting the helpfulness score. Overall, the relevant information about Speaker A working at a restaurant and enjoying it, despite being busy, provides a moderate level of helpfulness to the dialogue context."
