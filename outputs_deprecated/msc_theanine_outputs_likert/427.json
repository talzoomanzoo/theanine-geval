Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing?\nSpeaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha!\nSpeaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes?\nSpeaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe. \nSpeaker A: You make them sounds so fascinating. Will you take them with you to your college dorm? \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B recently divorced their wife and loves to scuba dive in Hawaii when not working. Speaker A is scared of sharks but finds the idea of going into a steel cage with them interesting. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n\nSpeaker B recently divorced their wife and loves to scuba dive in Hawaii when not working. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n\nSpeaker A is a student planning to go to college next year and wants to study neuroscience.

    "raw_prediction": "I wish I could, but I don't think most dorms allow pets. I'll have to find a way to visit Hansel and Gretel during breaks.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, it mentions that Speaker B has pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel, which ties in with the context of their conversation about pet snakes. Additionally, it provides some context about Speaker B's interest in science and animals, which aligns with the themes being discussed. However, the MEMORY also contains a lot of irrelevant information related to scuba diving, divorce, and Speaker A's interests that do not directly contribute to generating the next response. The helpful information is mixed with less relevant data, making it somewhat difficult for a language model to easily identify the key elements needed for the conversation's continuity. The MEMORY could be more concise and focused on directly relevant details to warrant a higher score."
