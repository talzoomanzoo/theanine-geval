Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume.\nSpeaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has visited 20 countries and enjoys the color turquoise. Speaker A and Speaker B both like the color turquoise. Speaker B keeps a turquoise lotus origami on their desk from Japan. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully. \n\nSpeaker A finds meaning and fulfillment in doing volunteer work. As a result, Speaker A is working on painting projects in their craft room. Speaker A volunteers at a hospital and enjoys making origami crafts, specifically a 3D modular swan with glue. This changed when Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be helpful in generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY establishes that Speaker A enjoys origami and has experience making origami crafts, which connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A mentions winning a prize in an origami contest. This connection is helpful as it gives context to Speaker B's congratulatory response and could guide further conversation about Speaker A's origami interests and achievements.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY also includes information about Speaker B's travels, color preferences, and the origami on their desk, which are less directly relevant to the given context. While the mention of origami in Speaker B's MEMORY could slightly relate if the conversation were to shift towards common interests, the current context does not strongly utilize these points.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides some helpful context but also contains elements that are not directly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences are generally well-structured, but the relevance varies, justifying a mid-range score."
