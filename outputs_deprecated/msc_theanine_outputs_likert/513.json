Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well?\nSpeaker B: The older one seems to like it while the youngest cannot be bothered. Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon?\nSpeaker A: Yes!  As a matter of fact, I'm visiting my son that lives in Spain next month.  This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now!\nSpeaker B: Oh nice. You must be looking forward to it. He must have told you a lot about her. Do you think you would like her?\nSpeaker A: I think so.  She seems like a very sweet girl and she seems to care deeply about my son, so that's what matters most.  You know, maybe I can stop by and visit you as well, since you live in Europe.  France, Spain, Italy?  Where are you living now?\nSpeaker B: Bless her, that's good to hear. That would be great! I live in Portugal. It's not too far from Spain. We can always arrange something. How long would you be there for?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe, where they have been studying abroad. Speaker A is a family man who loves spending time with his sons, despite worrying about them traveling far away.\n2. Speaker A has two sons, one of whom has a girlfriend and the other is secretive and possibly gay. Speaker A enjoys spending time with their sons and is trying to encourage one of them to get into programming or writing, but the son is more interested in gaming with friends. Speaker A's sons play video games and listen to music in their rooms.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that can help in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, it mentions that Speaker A has two sons and that one of them has a girlfriend, which connects to the part of the dialogue where Speaker A talks about meeting their son's girlfriend. Additionally, it mentions that the sons are studying abroad in Europe, which correlates with the part of the dialog where they discuss traveling to Europe.\n\nHowever, there are some aspects of the MEMORY that aren't explicitly helpful or relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the secretive nature and possible sexual orientation of one son, or the details about programming, writing, and gaming interests.\n\nThe MEMORY is somewhat naturally structured but doesn't provide direct contextual cues for the current dialogue's development. It's helpful in some areas but doesn't fully meet the criterion of being consistently relevant or clearly connecting to the dialogue.\n\nOverall, while MEMORY provides some helpful context, there's room for improvement in concern to direct relevancy and specificity to aid in response generation fully."
