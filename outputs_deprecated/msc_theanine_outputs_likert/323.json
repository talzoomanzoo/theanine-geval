Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company? Do you build computers or work on programming?\nSpeaker B: I do like my job. My job is to troubleshoot issues between the hardware and software, so I get to work with both.\nSpeaker A: That sounds interesting. That's great that you love your job, not many people do.\nSpeaker B: Love is a strong word! I do like it though. There have been jobs I hated and I'm great full not be in that place. Hows you job going?\nSpeaker A: Its going good. Its summer so we are really busy right now. I am just grateful to be back at work. How long have you worked for your company?\nSpeaker B: For about four years. It's an industry in flux which is stressful. I need stability for my family at this point. It has changed my focus, which I'm not used to yet. Are you considering any other options for work?\nSpeaker A: Yes I am considering going back to school for dentistry. I am trying to get grants for the money I need. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A's father was in the military, and Speaker B's mother is a dentist. Speaker A has been looking at dental programs in colleges, leading to considering going back to school for dentistry in the future. \nSpeaker A is 27 years old and hopes to change careers soon, which has led to looking at dental programs in colleges. Speaker A wants to pursue a career in dentistry but is also interested in working at Disney for happiness. \nSpeaker B loves meeting new people and enjoys Disney World more than their child, which makes Speaker A consider quitting their job to work at Disney World. Speaker A is torn between choosing a career in dentistry for the money or working at Disney for happiness.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's a big decision. Dentistry is a great field. Have you always been interested in teeth?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically about Speaker A's consideration of going back to school for dentistry. This ties directly into the part of the dialogue where Speaker A mentions trying to get grants for dental school. Additionally, it gives context about Speaker A's motivations for career changes and aspirations, which are helpful in understanding the dialogue. However, some parts of the MEMORY, such as details about Speaker A's age or Speaker B's enjoyment of Disney World, do not contribute meaningfully to the immediate dialogue context or the development of interactions between Speaker A and B. Additionally, the MEMORY contains sentences about Speaker B's interests and family connections that are not directly referenced in this dialogue, slightly reducing its overall helpfulness for generating the next response. Therefore, the MEMORY earns a mid-level score."
