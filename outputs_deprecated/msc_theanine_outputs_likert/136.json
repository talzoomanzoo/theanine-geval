Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\nSpeaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is playing soccer and volunteering at their mom's school in the after-school program. Speaker A is studying computer science and expressing a desire to develop apps for differently abled youth. Speaker A is also interested in teaching computer science, particularly in the field of robotics. \n\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college while studying computer science. Speaker B has transitioned to casually playing Overwatch and enjoying 1st person shooter games for their quick pick-up-and-play nature. Speaker B recommends trying the game Elder Scrolls, aware that Speaker A plays World of Warcraft.\n\nSpeaker B was majoring in linguistics but has now changed course to consider pursuing a masters degree after completing their bachelors. This change is influenced by their hope of turning linguistics into a practical job, potentially becoming a college professor in the field. Speaker B, while studying linguistics, expresses feeling limited in job opportunities.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I think I'd like to teach linguistics, it's a subject I'm passionate about and I believe it's important to pass that knowledge on to others.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides several useful pieces of information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. First, it gives insight into Speaker B's background and interests, mentioning their initial focus on linguistics and their consideration of a master's degree, which ties into the current discussion about Speaker B's career options. This context supports Speaker B's decision to move towards teaching as a more stable career path. Additionally, MEMORY highlights Speaker A's interest in teaching robotics, aligning with DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A expresses a desire to teach robotics someday.\n\nSeveral details also illustrate Speaker B's extracurricular activities, such as playing soccer and volunteering, which can be useful contextual cues even if they do not directly influence the immediate response to the current discussion. Overall, while not every detail of MEMORY is directly relevant, the information is organized in a way that helps form a coherent picture of both speakers' backgrounds and interests, aiding in generating a thoughtful response."
