Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing?\nSpeaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from?\nSpeaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there.\nSpeaker B: That's great. I have gotten my pets from the shelter and they seem happy I brought them home. I have a hard time saying no to them which is why I have so many pets. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs. Do you have a name in mind for your cat? \nSpeaker A: I've thought of a lot of  names, but in the end it will probably depend on the breed and the sex.  \nSpeaker B: That's true. Is pilates hard? I've always wanted to try it but I don't know if it will be too difficult.\nSpeaker A: No, I don't think it's hard.  I actually enjoy it.  It's more fun than work, at least to me. You should give it a try!\nSpeaker B: Maybe I will. Do you think I can start at home by watching Youtube videos, or do I need to go to a Pilates class?\nSpeaker A: You can probably start with Youtube just to see if you like it.  Much better to go to a class I think though.  Of course, I'm biased. I'm in love with my instructor! haha\nSpeaker B: Lol, okay I will definitely try it at home first. If I can get the hang of it, I will sign up for a class. Hopefully I can get an instructor as good as yours lol! \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A might commission a family portrait from Speaker B, who prefers painting regular people over professionals and discovered a love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets. Speaker B thinks pit bulls are lovely and owns a kind and sweet one, while also liking Persian cats and imagining their pets having interesting interactions. \nSpeaker B, who is in college, paints on the side, and has five dogs and three rats, used to prefer painting regular people over professionals until discovering a passion for portraits through a self-portrait with pets. Speaker A, who used to work at a doggie daycare where there was a mean dog named Maggie, reads a novel a week, lives in the city, and goes to pilates class.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it also contains extraneous details that are not directly relevant to the conversation. For example, the MEMORY mentions that Speaker A might commission a family portrait from Speaker B, which could be relevant given the discussion about painting portraits of pets. This suggests a shared interest or potential collaboration between the two speakers.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY also includes details that are less pertinent to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's preference for painting regular people, their experience in college, and the number of pets they have. While this information gives a broader context of the speaker's backgrounds, it doesn't directly aid in generating a response in the specific conversation about Pilates, pet portraits, and new pets. \n\nOverall, the MEMORY has relevant sentences that could enrich the dialogue but also contains unrelated information, which may not significantly benefit the language model in generating the next response. This imbalance results in an average score."
