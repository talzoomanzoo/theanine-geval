    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break. This excitement led Speaker B to dye their hair with henna and enjoy experimenting with different hair colors. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one. Both Speaker A and Speaker B have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation. Speaker A has a granddaughter who is a cosmetologist and helped dye their hair in streaks. Speaker A is getting their hair dyed turquoise by their youngest grandchild, who wants to pursue hairdressing as a profession. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet, showing their excitement for the upcoming adventure.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'll be in Costa Rica for about a week. I can't wait to explore the rainforests and beaches!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant context for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically the detail about Speaker B's excitement for an upcoming trip and not having packed yet, which aligns with their plans to visit Costa Rica. However, the majority of the information about hair dyeing and Speaker A's family members is not directly relevant to the context or the new conversation about travel plans. These details, while nicely connected and naturally phrased, do not significantly benefit the language model in generating a pertinent response related to the current topic of travel. The connections between the two speakers in MEMORY are clearly structured, even if not entirely relevant to the present dialogue."
