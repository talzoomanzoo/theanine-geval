Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\nSpeaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call!\nSpeaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip? \nSpeaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery\nSpeaker B: Yes I think that's a great idea, how is work at the library? \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A loves kids and works as a librarian, mentioning having 3 children. Speaker B mentions having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n\nSpeaker B's kids do not go to work by boat like Speaker A. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n\nSpeaker B has a lot of kids, all grown up now and with kids of their own. Speaker B mentions having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park. Speaker A has children and grandchildren, with at least one child interested in learning the flute.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "Work at the library is busy as usual, but I love helping kids discover new books and stories.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information that can aid in generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that Speaker A works as a librarian and has 3 children, which is useful as it connects to the topic of work mentioned in the dialogue. Similarly, it confirms that Speaker B enjoys spending time with their grandkids and is interested in making the fishing trip an annual tradition, which is relevant because the conversation touches on both grandparenting and the fishing trip idea.\n\nHowever, there are several redundancies and unrelated details in the MEMORY, such as Speaker B's kids not going to work by boat like Speaker A, or that Speaker A has a child interested in learning the flute, which don't tie directly into the dialogue. Additionally, there is repetition about Speaker B enjoying time with grandkids at the park, which doesn't add much value to the context provided.\n\nOverall, while the MEMORY has relevant facts, its effectiveness is somewhat diminished by repetition and inclusion of unrelated details. More concise and directly relevant information would improve its helpfulness."
