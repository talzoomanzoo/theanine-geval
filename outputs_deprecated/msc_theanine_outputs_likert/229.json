Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet? \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B lives in the city they grew up in, loves animals, and has a cat that recently had a kitten. This has led to Speaker B having two sick kitties and recently receiving a rescue. Speaker A, on the other hand, has a pet named Tasha who speaks Mandarin and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten. Speaker A suggested the name Zhao for one of the kittens.\n\nSpeaker B lives in the city they grew up in, loves animals, and has a cat that recently had a kitten.

    "raw_prediction": "I've been considering naming the rescue kittens based on their personalities. Any suggestions?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker B has kittens that need names, which directly relates to Speaker A's question about naming the kittens. Additionally, it provides context regarding Speaker B's interest in giving the kittens Mandarin names based on their personalities, which connects to Speaker A's suggestion of the name Zhao and implies a framework for how names are being chosen. However, there is some repetition of information, and the MEMORY lacks a clear and consistent narrative or causal connection between some of the points, particularly the status of the rescue situations and the health of the cats. Although it includes details about Speaker B and the interactions with Speaker A, some information could be structured more coherently to enhance the model's understanding when generating a response."
