Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it! Thank you for the recommendation.\nSpeaker B: Of course. I recommend that movie to everyone I meet. I think I've watched it over one hundred times. So what is the next movie on your list to watch soon?\nSpeaker A: Yeah it was great and I will also recommend to people when they ask what movie is good. So next is another one you recommended which is coming to America. What’s the next movie your going to watch? \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is interested in watching movies, mentioned Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman. Speaker B enjoys watching suspense films, action, SF, horror, westerns, drama, and occasional good comedy. Speaker B is knowledgeable about movies and provides recommendations based on Speaker A's preferences.\nSpeaker A enjoyed the movie \"Coming to America\" and expressed interest in watching its sequel.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but not in a complete or highly structured manner. \n\n1. **Relevant Information**: The MEMORY indicates that Speaker A has an interest in movies, specifically mentioning \"Pulp Fiction\" and their interest in \"Coming to America,\" which are relevant to the context since Speaker A talks about watching these films. The MEMORY partially matches Speaker A and B's conversation about movie preferences and recommendations.\n\n2. **Missing Connection**: The MEMORY does not clearly mention Speaker A recently watched \"Pulp Fiction\" and appreciated it due to Speaker B's recommendation, nor does it state Speaker A is planning to watch \"Coming to America\" next. \n\n3. **Additional Details**: The information about Speaker B's movie genre preferences and knowledge is generally helpful but lacks context-specific details that align directly with the current conversation about what movie Speaker B will watch next.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides some relevant context, but it could improve by offering clearer connections and fully capturing the development of the interaction concerning the discussion of specific movies mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
