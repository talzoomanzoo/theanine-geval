Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive.\nSpeaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price?\nSpeaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music\nSpeaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B have a friendly interaction and part ways on a positive note. They both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\nSpeaker A has never been to college and values the peaceful life of working on the farm. Speaker A mentions that Speaker B's kids could try milking cows on the farm, which Speaker B finds amusing. They discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\nSpeaker B believes that luxurious items distract from the value of their family. Speaker A bought 50 lotto tickets with different numbers to increase their chances of winning.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That would be a nice surprise! Who knows, maybe one of those 50 lotto tickets will bring me some luck.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides several relevant details that are beneficial for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Firstly, the MEMORY mentions that both speakers bought lotto tickets, which directly connects to Speaker B's suggestion that winning the lotto might help pay for the iPhone. This adds context to their conversation and allows for a more informed response by Speaker A regarding lotto strategies or aspirations. Additionally, MEMORY notes that Speaker B believes luxurious items distract from family values, which could be relevant to the discussion about the expensive iPhone purchase. The details about Speaker A valuing farm life and the humorous suggestion about Speaker B's kids milking cows add depth to their characters and overall relationship. However, some aspects of the MEMORY (such as specific details about Speaker A's background) may not be directly useful for generating the next response, preventing a perfect score. Overall, the MEMORY is structured well and is mostly relevant, facilitating a meaningful continuation of the dialogue."
