Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\nSpeaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A knowing how to swim since the age of 5 has led to their plan of doing snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination. This has sparked a desire in Speaker A and Speaker B to consider getting on a cruise ship together.\nSpeaker B's enjoyment of cruising in their car while listening to punk music has inspired Speaker A to plan a cruise to the Caribbeans, changing Speaker A's travel plans for their next trip.\nSpeaker A's love for cruising and having a favorite club in school has influenced their decision to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination. This has also fueled a discussion between Speaker A and Speaker B about the possibility of going on a cruise together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "I enjoy cruising to nearby cities like Savannah or Charleston. They have charming vibes.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant background information, such as Speaker A's interest in snorkeling and their ability to swim from a young age, which is helpful in understanding the context where Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim. It also hints at Speaker A's love for cruising, which is consistent with their excitement about going on a cruise. However, the MEMORY contains repetitive information about the desire to get on a cruise together, and the connection to Speaker B's enjoyment of cruising in their car while listening to punk music is less clear. The sentences are generally structured well, but some of the events or connections mentioned are not entirely consistent with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, reducing its overall helpfulness. A clearer, more consistent, and less redundant MEMORY would improve the helpfulness score."
