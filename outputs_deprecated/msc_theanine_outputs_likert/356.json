Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on!\nSpeaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar.\nSpeaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general?\nSpeaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts.\nSpeaker A: How's learning to bake going in general, especially now that you're off desserts?\nSpeaker B: I one of those people how have to fail a couple of times before I get the hang of it, but I'm getting there.  Have you and the kids had any chance to go skiing lately?\nSpeaker A: Water skiing? Yes, last weekend. It was so much fun!\nSpeaker B: (sorry my typing sucks)  That's awesome. I wish had access to a boat, but who knows, maybe one day. \nSpeaker A: Boating is so fun. You could go wakeboarding more often if you had your own boat. And no more boat rental fees or hassle.\nSpeaker B: I actually saw a drone the at will pull you in the water. It's the craziest thing.  \nSpeaker A: That must be a huge drone!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is excited to buy their first new car and wants to try water skiing next. They are looking forward to joining Speaker A's family for a water skiing trip and learning from Speaker A's kids.\nSpeaker B values following their passions for snowboarding and music. Speaker A loves boating and water sports, mentioning that they are better at water skiing than wakeboarding. Speaker B is considering living in a houseboat when they are old and retired.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I bet using a drone for water sports would be an exhilarating experience!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information that can aid Speaker B in generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, the mention of Speaker B wanting to try water skiing next and being excited about joining Speaker A's family for a trip aligns with the current conversation, where water skiing has been brought up. Additionally, the note that Speaker A loves boating and water sports adds a helpful context that concurs with Speaker A's enthusiasm in the dialogue about owning a boat. However, some details like Speaker B's passion for snowboarding and music or considering living in a houseboat when retired are not directly relevant to the immediate context, making them less useful for generating a direct next response. Overall, the connection and flow in the MEMORY could be more relevant and specifically focused on the dialogue context."
