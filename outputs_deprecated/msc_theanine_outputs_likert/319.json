Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company? Do you build computers or work on programming?\nSpeaker B: I do like my job. My job is to troubleshoot issues between the hardware and software, so I get to work with both.\nSpeaker A: That sounds interesting. That's great that you love your job, not many people do.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys reading books about ice cream, Disney World, and computers, and is open to meeting for lunch and is flexible with food choices. \nSpeaker B works for a computer company and is unable to change careers until their child graduates, but is interested in taking them to Disney World and is willing to help set up a meeting between Speaker A and their mother. \nSpeaker A works for a small local business with a demanding schedule, does not have children, spends time working and reading, and prefers late morning for a meeting.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker B's occupation, which is directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as it mentions that Speaker B works for a computer company. This is useful for understanding Speaker B's interest and ability in troubleshooting issues between hardware and software, as described in the dialogue.\n\nHowever, the rest of the MEMORY contains details that are not directly related to the current dialogue context, such as Speaker A's reading preferences, Speaker B's interest in visiting Disney World, and Speaker A's work schedule. These details, while structured coherently, do not add significant value to generating a response in this specific context about Speaker B's job at the computer company.\n\nThe MEMORY could be improved by focusing more on the aspects directly related to the conversation, such as Speaker B's experiences and feelings about their job, and the technical details of their work that might interest Speaker A. This would provide stronger contextual cues for generating responses relevant to the dialogue topic."
