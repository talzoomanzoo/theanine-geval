Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens?\nSpeaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month\nSpeaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically the mention that Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend. This directly ties into the current conversation about deciding on getting a kitten. However, much of the information in the MEMORY, such as the repeated details about hobbies, visiting the zoo, and pets owned by Speaker B's girlfriend and Speaker A's sister, does not directly contribute to the current dialogue about the kitten or vacation plans. The repetition of similar content across different entries also suggests a lack of natural progression or development of past interactions between the speakers. Hence, while there is some relevant information, the overall structure and repetition limit its helpfulness in generating a response."
