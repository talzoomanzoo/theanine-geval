Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college?\nSpeaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position. \nSpeaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it?\nSpeaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \nSpeaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket while majoring in Humanities, but now plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week. They are a member of a soccer team and enjoy playing in tournaments. Speaker A enjoys watching international teams play and is a fan of Arsenal. Speaker A enjoys playing soccer and joked about treating Speaker B to lunch, hinting that Speaker B is currently low on cash. Both Speaker A and Speaker B have arachnophobia and fear spiders.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that can be helpful in generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week, which relates to their interest in soccer discussed in the context. The background about Speaker A being a fan of Arsenal and enjoying international teams can also be relevant if the conversation shifts towards discussing specific teams or players.\n\nHowever, a significant portion of the MEMORY is not directly related to the context, such as Speaker A's past work at a supermarket, their study of Humanities, or, to some extent, the shared fear of spiders. These details do not precisely connect to the ongoing soccer-themed conversation, hence reducing the overall score.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY has a mixture of relevant and irrelevant information, but the relevant parts are structured clearly enough to be identified and used effectively in the conversation. Therefore, it scores a 3 for offering some helpful context, even though it's interspersed with less relevant details."
