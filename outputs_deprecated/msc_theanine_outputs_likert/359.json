    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week?\nSpeaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you?\nSpeaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions?\n\nMEMORY:\n- Speaker B plays a lot of video games, specifically League of Legends, and owns a new gaming laptop. As a result, Speaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII.\n- Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World. Consequently, Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n- Speaker A prefers tamer video games and is not a fan of horror movies. This leads to Speaker A being hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World. In response, Speaker B mentions that Resident Evil can be scary and provides some tips for playing it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "How about trying out a game like Stardew Valley or Minecraft? They're more relaxed and less intense compared to Resident Evil.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights Speaker B's interest in video games and specifically mentions their recent purchase of Resident Evil VIII, which directly connects to the context where Speaker B talks about playing Resident Evil. Additionally, the MEMORY describes Speaker A's hesitation towards scary games and preference for tamer video games, which aligns with their expressed dislike for scary video games in the dialogue. These details provide context that can assist a language model in generating a response about game suggestions that might suit Speaker A's preferences. The MEMORY is well-structured and clearly demonstrates the relevance of these preferences and past interactions between the speakers. The level of detail is appropriate, allowing the language model to easily extract necessary cues for generating a response. However, there is some repetition (e.g., mentioning Speaker A's preferences for tamer games twice), which slightly reduces coherence, preventing a score of 5."
