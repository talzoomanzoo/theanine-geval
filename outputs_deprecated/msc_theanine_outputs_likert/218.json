Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A's pet raccoon enjoys eating pizza because Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid.\n2. Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid, so Speaker A wants to have a pet raccoon and has a friend who found baby raccoons.\n3. Speaker B enjoys going on cruises for fun as Speaker A has been working at their job for almost 10 years and has only taken 3 vacations.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "**Helpfulness Score: 3**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information about Speaker A's pet raccoon named Journey and how Journey enjoys eating pizza, which directly relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Journey ate a piece of pizza. This connection helps a language model understand the scenario better. \n\nHowever, MEMORY also includes less relevant information, such as Speaker A's bearded dragon named Sid and Speaker B's enjoyment of cruises, which do not substantially contribute to understanding the dialogue context around the raccoon eating pizza. This lack of focus on directly relevant past interactions and the unnecessary mix of disparate details reduces the overall helpfulness of the MEMORY.\n\nWhile the sentence about Journey's enjoyment of pizza is natural and relevant, the presence of other less connected pieces of information makes it somewhat challenging for the language model to immediately derive a focused understanding of the dialogue."
