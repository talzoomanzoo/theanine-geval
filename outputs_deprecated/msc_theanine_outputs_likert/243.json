Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not!\nSpeaker B: Have you been hiking lately?\nSpeaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me.\nSpeaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks. This has led to Speaker A planning several camping trips for the summer and deciding to do a part of the Appalachian Trail. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking as free activities, and this aligns with their interest in looking for wild animals in the woods.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and offers context about Speaker A's interests and activities. It highlights Speaker A's enjoyment of camping trips and hiking, which directly ties into the context of the conversation, where Speaker A talks about leading friends on a hike and using mosquito repellent. The memory gives insight into Speaker A's future plans, like planning summer camping trips and tackling part of the Appalachian Trail, which adds depth to their character as an outdoors enthusiast. Additionally, it mentions Speaker A's interest in observing wildlife, though this is not directly connected to the current dialogue, it remains contextually relevant and coherently structured. This structure and connectivity aid in understanding Speaker A's motivations and could assist a language model in generating a consistent response. Not every piece of information is directly tied to the current conversation, but they are phrased naturally and are not distracting, allowing the language model to discern contextually important cues."
