Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue.\nSpeaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad.\nSpeaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs!\nSpeaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is looking to redecorate their house and is considering adding more colorful elements to the room to make the purple sofas work. Speaker A recently bought new furniture for their house, including a couch, recliner, and patio furniture.\nSpeaker B regrets their green and purple color scheme, recently purchased purple sofas for their home, and is willing to give away their purple furniture.\nSpeaker B is in the process of renovating their house to meet their living standards with their pets and plans to meet up with Speaker A to discuss the furniture exchange. Speaker A has devices to keep bugs away and offers to share the product names with Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I got my patio furniture from a local store that had a great sale. I can share the details with you when we meet up.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for the language model representing Speaker A to generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It clearly captures key elements of the conversation, such as Speaker B's interest in redecorating their house and their regret about the green and purple color scheme, which aligns with Speaker B's dialogue about needing to do something about the current color scheme. It also highlights Speaker B's intention to add more colorful elements to make the purple sofas work, which is relevant for Speaker A's recommendation on color schemes. \n\nAdditionally, the MEMORY mentions the bug problem and Speaker A's capability to help with that by offering product names, which follows from A's remark about bringing a bug-repellent lamp. It also includes details about Speaker A having recently purchased furniture, allowing A to credibly recommend places to buy patio furniture. Although MEMORY contains some details not directly mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, they are naturally phrased and easily distinguishable. However, the mention of a potential furniture exchange might not directly pertain to the current context where the focus is decorating and preparing for a barbecue. Overall, the MEMORY is well-structured and manages to capture significant parts of the interaction."
