Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet? \nSpeaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name?\nSpeaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \nSpeaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along!\nSpeaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them.\nSpeaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a pet parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten. Speaker A is a country girl who loves animals and is considering adopting a rescue kitten despite having a parrot. Speaker A is interested in training tips for the kittens and is open to adopting one despite having a parrot. Speaker B has an older mellow cat and is concerned about training the new energetic kittens.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some useful information regarding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A having a parrot named Tasha and an interest in adopting a rescue kitten. This is relevant to the conversation about adopting kittens and the possible interaction between the kittens and the parrot. However, other details in the MEMORY, such as Speaker A being a country girl and interested in training tips, do not directly pertain to the current dialogue or enhance the understanding of past interactions related to the current conversation. Additionally, the mention of Speaker B having an older mellow cat doesn't directly relate to the context of naming or adopting kittens. Overall, the MEMORY provides some pertinent information but lacks a comprehensive connection to the context."
