Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\nSpeaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car?\nSpeaker B: Yes, there are several. Hope we could meet and You possibly teach me about computer programming.\nSpeaker A: That would be great too. I like to program in several different languages. Do you have a preference?\nSpeaker B: No, I'm just getting started so I don't have a preference. Maybe you could show me what you prefer and we could start there.\nSpeaker A: Sure. I usually like to start with html and css so we can start there. We'll order some pizzaburgers to help us out. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming, despite Speaker B not knowing how to swim but enjoying watching swimming movies. Speaker B also enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming. Additionally, Speaker A has planned a cruise to the Caribbeans, and both Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together while enjoying cruising in their car listening to punk music.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It touches on several key aspects of the conversation, such as Speaker A offering to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming, and their mutual interest in punk music. However, it also contains inaccuracies, like saying Speaker B enjoys watching swimming movies, which is not mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Furthermore, the MEMORY fails to capture some important details like Speaker A's plan to start programming lessons with HTML and CSS or the mention of pizzaburgers. The memory captures the general theme of the dialogue context but misses some nuance and specifics that could aid in generating a more coherent and contextually aware response. Overall, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful, but it's not fully aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT in its entirety."
