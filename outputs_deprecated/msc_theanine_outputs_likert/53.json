Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\nSpeaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient! \nSpeaker A: Wow, that gives me a completely different perspective. You'd really be ok with seeing me? You don't think it would be a conflict of interest since we're friends?\nSpeaker B: No not at all but if you didn't feel comfortable talking to me I can recommend a couple of my colleagues who are just as brilliant\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a passion for horse breeding and taking care of horses, working at a stable and enjoying being around them.\nSpeaker B, living in the city, is interested in having a horse in the future and considers the psychological aspects of owning one, relating it to Freudian theories.\nSpeaker B's profession as a therapist is influenced by their mom being a busy nurse, causing them to discuss the challenges and rewards of being a therapist and the restrictions on relationships with clients.\nSpeaker B, a therapist and a football fan supporting the Chiefs, reflects on the profession's ups and downs, while Speaker A mentions the potential medical costs of horses hurting themselves during exercise.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate the offer, and I'll definitely think about it. It's good to know that therapy can have an endpoint for some people.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided offers some helpful context about Speaker A and Speaker B's interests and background, which could aid in generating a response that aligns with their personalities and ongoing dialogue. For instance, the information about Speaker A's passion for horses supports a connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Speaker A mentions finding therapy in riding horses. Similarly, it notes Speaker B's profession as a therapist and their interest in psychological aspects, relevant since the conversation revolves around therapy. However, the MEMORY also includes several details that are not directly related to the conversation at hand, such as Speaker B's support for a football team and the medical costs of horses, which make the overall MEMORY only moderately helpful in understanding the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The connections and developments between speakers' past interactions are not entirely clear or optimally structured, further influencing the score given."
