Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college?\nSpeaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket while majoring in Humanities, but now plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week. They are a member of a soccer team and enjoy playing in tournaments. \nSpeaker A enjoys playing soccer but is not into music, and as a result, they are a fan of Arsenal and enjoy watching international teams play. \nSpeaker A enjoys playing soccer but is not into music, and as a result, joked about treating Speaker B to lunch, indicating Speaker B is currently low on cash. Speaker B is considering asking for a raise at work and works as a clerk for a law firm. They enjoy the work but wish it paid better.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Being a goalkeeper takes a lot of skill and focus. Do you still play soccer now, even casually?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT in that it mentions Speaker A playing soccer as a striker, which ties into the context of the soccer conversation. This indicates some development and relevancy to Speaker A's soccer history, which could help in generating a response that furthers the conversation. However, the MEMORY also contains other pieces of information that, although naturally phrased, do not directly contribute to the current dialogue about soccer positions. Details such as Speaker B's financial situation and career aspirations, while interesting, aren't directly linked to the context of the conversation about soccer positions. Overall, the MEMORY rests at a midpoint due to its partial relevancy and clear deviation from the core conversational topic."
