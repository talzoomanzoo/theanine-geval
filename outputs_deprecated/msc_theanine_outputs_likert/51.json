Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\nSpeaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient! \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B's mom being a nurse and busy with work has influenced Speaker B to become a therapist, where they mention the ups and downs of the profession. Speaker B, living in the city, expresses a desire to have a horse in the future, considering the psychological aspects of owning one and relating it to Freudian theories. \n\nWhen Speaker B offers to discuss the absence of Speaker A's mother and suggests lying down on their couch, Speaker B, as a therapist, talks about the profession's challenges and rewards. Additionally, Speaker B reflects on the costs associated with owning horses, such as medical fees and expenses like horse shoes, and explores the psychological aspects of horse ownership in connection to Freudian theories.\n\nBeing both a therapist and a football fan supporting the Chiefs, Speaker B consistently brings up the ups and downs of the therapy profession. Furthermore, Speaker B contemplates the financial implications of horse ownership, including medical costs and expenses like horse shoes, while also delving into the psychological dimensions of owning a horse through a Freudian lens.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's interesting to know, I didn't realize therapy could be completed in a shorter time frame for some. I'll definitely consider reaching out to you for a session.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information regarding Speaker B's background and interests (influence of Speaker B's mother, desire to own a horse, football fandom, costs of owning a horse, and Freudian theories) but these details are not directly connected or helpful to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on therapy, its challenges, and Speaker A's consideration of therapy. The MEMORY could potentially provide context about Speaker B's personality and their perspective on therapy, but it doesn't strongly connect to the current conversation, where Speaker B is sharing personal experiences as a therapist and offering therapy to Speaker A. Additionally, the mentions of Freudian theories and football fandom seem out of place and do not add value to the dialogue. The MEMORY is somewhat relevant, but the lack of direct connection and excess of unrelated information limit its helpfulness."
