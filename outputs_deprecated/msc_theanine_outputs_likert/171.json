Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me?\nSpeaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week?\nSpeaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day\nSpeaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through\nSpeaker A: Actually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to it. Do you think I will need to rent a car when I'm there, or is it possible to walk and bike in the summer? I always picture huge amounts of snow but I'm not sure if it's like that all year round.\nSpeaker A: I would definitely recommend looking for a rental car to have on hand. There is a town within walking distance from me, but it can be dangerous to walk with the wolves and elk around, especially at night.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A suggests going on hikes in Alaska to see wildlife and mentions glaciers as a potential attraction, which Speaker B is interested in during their visit. Speaker A also mentioned the wildlife, including elk and wolves, which Speaker B is interested in by asking about a wolf petting zoo.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information about previous interactions between Speaker A and Speaker B, specifically regarding the wildlife in Alaska. This connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where mention is made of the wildlife (wolves and elk) and the potential danger they pose, which could help Speaker B make an informed decision about renting a car. However, the MEMORY is not ideally structured and does not fully capture the development and complexity of past conversations. For instance, it inaccurately implies interest in a \"wolf petting zoo,\" which is not present in the current dialogue context. Additionally, the MEMORY provides specific details like hiking and glaciers that were not referenced in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making it somewhat disconnected and lacking cohesion with the given dialogue. While the MEMORY is somewhat helpful, it could be better structured and more aligned with the cues present in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
