    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science. Speaker B is considering getting a master's degree after completing their bachelor's and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\nSpeaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you, I appreciate the support. Teaching robotics sounds fascinating, I'm sure you'd excel in that field.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains relevant details about Speaker A's interest in teaching and robotics, which aligns with the current discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about teaching as a career option. It also highlights Speaker B's major in linguistics and their consideration of a teaching career, which ties into their conversation about career options and the idea of teaching being a stable career. The MEMORY outlines Speaker B's potential path towards becoming a college professor and their feeling of limited job opportunities in linguistics, which adds depth to Speaker B's character and can assist in generating a more informed and relevant response. However, the MEMORY could benefit from slightly more explicit connections between Speaker A and B's educational pursuits and their conversation in the CONTEXT."
