Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B found their calling to become a therapist due to their passion for helping people and their enjoyment of listening and talking to others. This led them to start their own practice six years ago. Despite the challenges, Speaker B finds the impact they can make on people's lives to be incredibly rewarding.\n\nSpeaker B, as a therapist, offered to discuss the absence of Speaker A's mother and suggested lying down on their couch. They expressed interest in owning a horse in the future, contemplating the psychological aspects of it in relation to Freudian theories. Additionally, Speaker B, being a therapist and a football fan supporting the Chiefs, acknowledged the professional boundaries by not engaging in relationships with clients.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've never done therapy, but I can see how it could be beneficial. What made you decide to start your own practice?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It accurately reflects Speaker B's passion for being a therapist and their enjoyment in listening to others, which is directly connected to the conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Also, it mentions the establishment of their therapy practice, elucidating the development of Speaker B's career journey, which is complementary to their description of the job. The mention of challenges and rewards in the MEMORY parallels comments made in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, enhancing understanding of Speaker B's perspective. However, certain pieces of the MEMORY, such as the interest in owning a horse, Freudian theories, and supporting the Chiefs, are not connected to the current conversation and do not provide immediate usefulness for generating the next response. Yet, these aspects are naturally phrased, allowing the language model to understand their irrelevance. The MEMORY mostly fulfills its role but could be more focused on points directly related to the ongoing conversation."
