Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin!\nSpeaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name? \nSpeaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls! \nSpeaker B: I see what you meant. Plus the color is beautiful orange. I want to see them together, even I am not a cat person they must be cute together at that time. Once the kitten grows up, situation gonna change to me. How are they, they are doing well?\nSpeaker A: Marmalade is orange too but this is better because the baby is sassy and climbs up my leg to sit on my shoulder. I don't understand how you are not a cat person when you have such a large heart for stray kittens.\nSpeaker B: hehe you're right. But i can't explain that why I am not a cat person to you sorry. How's the weather like today, still good weather to have iced tea out there?\nSpeaker A: It's beautiful. I'm sitting outside while the Spice Girls are chasing bugs in the grass. What did your kids name your cats?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A recently visited a hair salon and drives a Mini Cooper. They also have a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, but now considering naming a new kitten Pumpkin. Speaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys taking them on trips. Speaker B went on a trip to San Diego with kids and struggled with parking for the Subaru.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "They named them Luna and Milo. They are totally different characters but they get along well most of the time.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that connects with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly about the naming of the new kitten, \"Pumpkin,\" and the existing cat named \"Ginger.\" This directly relates to the dialogue where Speaker A discusses their cats with Speaker B. Additionally, the MEMORY mentions that Speaker A enjoys taking the cats on trips, which reflects their affection for the cats, a sentiment expressed in the conversation as well. However, information such as Speaker A visiting a hair salon, driving a Mini Cooper, and Speaker B's trip to San Diego and parking issues do not connect to the ongoing dialogue and do not assist in generating the next response. However, the mention of the cats being on trips is a connected thought that reflects an ongoing care and activity shared by the speakers. Overall, while the MEMORY connects in part to the dialogue, it also contains details that are disconnected from the current conversation, reducing its overall helpfulness."
