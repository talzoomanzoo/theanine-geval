Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume.\nSpeaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment. \nSpeaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think?\nSpeaker A: It depends on what you are trying to make out of origami, you can make some super complicated stuff, there's actually special paper that you can get for it! You may have seen origami be used in the hospital for some breathing aperatus!\nSpeaker B: That's amazing. I had no idea, but that totally makes sense. Do you have to practice a lot -- sort of a use it or lose it kind of thing?\nSpeaker A: Yea, I think for the more complicated origami it's kind of a use it or lose it but for the simple stuff you can usually take a couple months of and still remember to do it! Did you see origami in Japan?\nSpeaker B: Not up close, but I noticed a lot in shop windows in certain areas. I love Japan -- they're so welcoming. One of our acquaintances GAVE me a kimono. She said it's customary to try to share their culture. Kind of different from America in my opinion.  \nSpeaker A: Oh, that sounds wonderful. It's impressive how much things that came from there and how giving a culture they are. America is definetly a lot different from them, have you visted different states in America?\nSpeaker B: Oh yes. I live in North Carolina, but I've been to almost every state. Alaska was by far my favorite, but I'm kind of a loner and it feels like a lot of people there are, so maybe I just relate. But the scenery and landscapes are unbelievably beautiful. What's your favorite place you've been to?\nSpeaker A: I just visited Italy recently, it was much better than I had first anticipated, similar to Alaska with all the landscapes and scenery! Now I'm planning to go to Japan, do you have any recommendations on what to do there?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys art and music, specifically painting. Speaker A and Speaker B both like the color turquoise. Speaker B keeps a turquoise lotus origami on their desk from Japan. Speaker A wishes to visit the country where origami was originally created, possibly Japan.\n\nSpeaker B has visited 20 countries and enjoys the color turquoise. Speaker B enjoys traveling and visiting gardens. Speaker B was recommended volunteering by Speaker A and has traveled to Japan and Italy, enjoying the art and food. Speaker B had to deal with Japan's visa requirements, which were expensive but worth it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Definitely visit the temples and gardens in Japan, they are absolutely stunning. And the food is just incredible, make sure to try some authentic sushi and ramen!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several helpful pieces of information that are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it mentions Speaker A's interest in visiting the country where origami was originally created, possibly Japan, which aligns with the ongoing discussion about origami, Japan, and Speaker A's travels. It also highlights Speaker B's travels to Japan and Italy, which is relevant to Speaker A's questions about Japan and sharing experiences about Italy. Furthermore, the MEMORY includes the fact that Speaker B enjoys traveling, which complements the travel-related dialog between the speakers. However, some parts of the MEMORY, such as the mutual liking of the color turquoise and the mention of volunteering, do not seem directly relevant to the current conversation. Overall, the MEMORY provides helpful context that is naturally connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, with only a few unrelated details, warranting a score of 4."
