    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \nSpeaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!).\nSpeaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol\nSpeaker B: I am up for the challenge! I have a few tricks up my sleeve to deal with people like you.\nSpeaker A: Oh geez that makes me sound difficult.lol  Do you have any new speeches coming up?\nSpeaker B: Nope, I just cleared my schedule until the Alps marathon that you're training for. It's just you and me until you break that finish line. I'm going to start sending you a motivational quote every morning at 4 am when I want you to wake up.\nSpeaker A: Wow 4 am.  Is it too late to change my mind?lol\nSpeaker B: Yes. We have an iron-clad written agreement. Tell me how I'm doing so far. Is this the most motivated you've ever been in your entire life?\nSpeaker A: No, but that's why I have you.  You're going to push me to do the things I can't bring myself to do.  I'll have more motivation tomorrow.  Today was a long work day.lol\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A, a runner who dislikes traveling but has visited 20 countries, is now working on improving their mile time and training for a marathon. This has caused Speaker A to seek advice on how to recover from training for marathons. In response, Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and planning to meet at the beach at 0600.\n\nSpeaker B, who travels frequently for work and misses their wife and kids, shares the same topic with Speaker A in improving mile time and training for a marathon. Speaker B is also a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks. Additionally, Speaker B mentioned combining fishing with feeling depressed, and taking young boys to the pond during school hours as a joke.\n\nSpeaker B, reacting to missing their family due to frequent travel, has previously run a marathon and found it tough but rewarding. This experience has caused Speaker B's desire to motivate people to be successful and follow their dreams. Speaker A suggested that Speaker B should combine something more active with feeling depressed to avoid dwelling on negative thoughts.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Rest up, tomorrow is a new day full of opportunities for progress. I'll be here to keep you on track and motivated.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some helpful information that aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT: both Speaker A and Speaker B are training for a marathon, and Speaker B is a motivational speaker. These aspects are directly related to the dialogue, where they discuss motivation and running. However, there are several extraneous details about traveling, missing family, and fishing, which do not seem to directly support the immediate context of the dialogue. Additionally, some sentences are somewhat disjointed or irrelevant to the main development of the conversation. Therefore, while it provides some useful context, the MEMORY could be better structured and more focused to improve usefulness for generating the next response."
