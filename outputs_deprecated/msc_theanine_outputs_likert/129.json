Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well?\nSpeaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes?\nSpeaker A: I want to take some martial art classes at school next year. What do you sggest I try?\nSpeaker B: I mean I always recommend Karate since that's what I study! I can bring you by the dojo sometime if you want to see what it is like. \nSpeaker A: OMG!! That would be so awesome, Yes please.  When is a good time for you?\nSpeaker B: Awesome! Tomorrow afternoon anytime between 3-6 would work for me!\nSpeaker A: Perfect. I will meet you at the Dojo at 3pm. I really appriciate it, and I will buy you lunch after too. \nSpeaker B: That's great! I can bring some guest passes to the pool I lifeguard at as well! I'm working this weekend if you want to come when I am working. Where do you want to eat?\nSpeaker A: I defiantly will. As well a bucket of sunscreen, safety in the sun first.  I was thinking that new sandwhich shop by the collage that just opened, what do nyou think? \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is studying marketing and enjoys it. Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work. Speaker B attends football games at their old high school and finds that their football background helps in karate footwork. Speaker B is considering a career change to the IT sector due to their computer skills and the growing demand for employees in that sector.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains information about Speaker B's activities and interests, which includes their involvement in karate and their contemplation of a career change to IT. However, most of this information is not directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on scheduling a visit to a dojo and discussing lunch plans. The details about Speaker B's football game attendance and IT career considerations do not contribute to the immediate conversation about martial arts and planning for the visit.\n\nThere is some helpful context with regards to Speaker B practicing karate and holding a green belt, as it aligns with their recommendation to Speaker A about trying out karate. However, the contextual clues that would help produce a relevant next response are minimal, and the memory doesn't significantly enhance or support the development of the current dialogue between the speakers. The information about Speaker A's studies in marketing is also not pertinent to their discussion.\n\nThe language model can identify that little in this MEMORY is beneficial for generating a next response, thus resulting in a low score."
