Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is studying marketing and enjoys it, while Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work. Both Speaker A and Speaker B have interests in learning new languages. Speaker B is considering a career change to the IT sector due to their computer skills and the growing demand for employees in that sector. Speaker B currently works as a lifeguard, which is physically demanding and not suitable for a long-term career.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I've also dabbled in Taekwondo and Judo before focusing on Karate.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be helpful for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, Speaker B's practice of Karate and holding a green belt directly relates to the topic of martial arts brought up by Speaker A. This provides Speaker B with specific background in martial arts that could inform their response to the question.\n\nHowever, the rest of the MEMORY, which includes information about Speaker A's marketing studies, and Speaker B's interest in IT and career aspirations, does not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT around martial arts. While it is naturally phrased and provides a context of interests outside martial arts, it might not aid the language model significantly in crafting a response to the specific question posed. \n\nThus, while not irrelevant, the MEMORY does not fully support generating a response directly tied to the martial arts theme beyond the mention of Karate. A higher helpfulness score would require a stronger connection to the specific context of martial arts discussed in the dialogue."
