Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well?\nSpeaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes?\nSpeaker A: I want to take some martial art classes at school next year. What do you sggest I try?\nSpeaker B: I mean I always recommend Karate since that's what I study! I can bring you by the dojo sometime if you want to see what it is like. \nSpeaker A: OMG!! That would be so awesome, Yes please.  When is a good time for you?\nSpeaker B: Awesome! Tomorrow afternoon anytime between 3-6 would work for me!\nSpeaker A: Perfect. I will meet you at the Dojo at 3pm. I really appriciate it, and I will buy you lunch after too. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B practices karate and works as a lifeguard but is looking for a different career. This is because Speaker B is considering a career change to the IT sector due to their computer skills and the growing demand for employees in that sector. Additionally, Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work. They have also signed up for classes at the local college and have a background in football and karate. \n\nSpeaker A is a student working on a marketing degree and enjoys watching movies in foreign languages. Similarly, Speaker A is studying marketing and enjoys it. They also want to explore the world of martial arts like Speaker B, who practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work. Additionally, Speaker B attends football games at their old high school and finds that their football background helps in karate footwork. \n\nSpeaker B practices karate and works as a lifeguard but is looking for a different career. This is because Speaker B is considering a career change to the IT sector due to their computer skills and the growing demand for employees in that sector. Furthermore, Speaker B tans easily and takes precautions against sunburn and skin cancer due to the nature of their job.

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds great! I'm looking forward to it. Let's plan for tomorrow at 3 pm at the Dojo. Lunch after sounds perfect too!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information about Speaker B's experience in karate, which is directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This information supports Speaker B's recommendation of karate classes to Speaker A. However, much of the MEMORY repeats information and includes details about career considerations, computer skills, and tanning precautions, which are not directly relevant to the context of discussing martial arts or scheduling a meeting at the dojo. While these additional details are generally coherently structured, their relevance to the immediate dialogue is limited. Therefore, the MEMORY partially supports generating an appropriate response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but could be more focused on pertinent interactions."
