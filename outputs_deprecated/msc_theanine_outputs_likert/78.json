    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\nSpeaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has a lot of kids, all grown up now and with kids of their own, causing Speaker A to have kids and be busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. Speaker B wants to spend time with their grandkids at the park, reacting to their grandkids being more interested in phones and tablets than musical instruments. \nSpeaker A, a librarian who loves kids, mentioned having 3 children, which changed to Speaker B mentioning having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own. Speaker B enjoys spending time with their grandkids at the park, reacting to taking them fishing once with mixed reactions. Speaker B's kids do not go to work by boat like Speaker A, but now Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park, reacting to their interest in technology over musical instruments.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great, it's important to stay connected in whatever way works best for you!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information about Speaker B having grandkids and their preference to spend time with them through traditional methods rather than using technology like phones and tablets. This is somewhat helpful for understanding Speaker B's perspective in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Speaker B expresses a preference for phone calls over text messaging. However, the MEMORY is somewhat repetitive and lacks clarity due to its fragmented structure, which makes it harder to follow the development of interaction between the speakers. The information about Speaker A being busy with work, being a librarian, and having kids themselves doesn't clearly connect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT or add significant value for generating Speaker Aâ€™s next response. The MEMORY could be more concise and focused on relevant contextual details to improve its helpfulness."
