Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for.\nSpeaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for?\nSpeaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\nSpeaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise? \nSpeaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows.\nSpeaker A: That sounds wonderful! You'd get to just be out in nature all day. Sounds like a great job, especially if you're a bit introverted like me. That's why hiking is my favorite -- a good solitary activity. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is looking for a job and new camping gear, specifically a hammock. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail. Speaker A decides not to bring the hammock due to extra weight in their bag. Speaker A has a portable hammock for the hike and asks if Speaker B will bring theirs. \nSpeaker A enjoys camping and hiking, mentioning setting up a hammock at their campsite. Speaker A plans to leave a hammock by the river for anyone to use at a hidden spot off the main hiking trail.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, being a park guide sounds like a great fit for you. You could combine your love for nature with your job. It's a dream job for many outdoor enthusiasts.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, it mentions that Speaker A applied for a job at a grocery store near a hiking trail, which connects to the current dialogue where Speaker A has been contacted for a job at a grocery store. Additionally, it provides information about Speaker A's interests in hiking and camping, aligning with their mention of enjoying solitary activities and hiking in the dialogue context. However, much of the memory focuses on Speaker A's interest in a hammock and camping, which are not directly related to the current conversation about job positions and career aspirations. The sentences are naturally structured and provide context into Speaker A's activities and interests, which could help in creating a future response, but they do not significantly advance the conversation related to job prospects or career paths."
