    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well?\nSpeaker B: The older one seems to like it while the youngest cannot be bothered. Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon?\nSpeaker A: Yes!  As a matter of fact, I'm visiting my son that lives in Spain next month.  This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A's boys have been out of town for a while and are leaving again in a few months, but Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe. \nSpeaker A enjoys different cuisines like Mexican, Italian, and Chinese, and her two sons have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next, which causes Speaker A's son and his girlfriend to study to be chefs in college.\nSpeaker A's sons play video games and listen to music in their rooms, and Speaker A's youngest son is addicted to social media and video games.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information that could be useful for generating a response in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It provides details about Speaker A's sons being in Europe, which is relevant to the discussion about visiting them. However, the information is scattered and not very well-organized, making it somewhat challenging to grasp the full development or causality of events. Additionally, there are details about Speaker A's culinary interests and the sons' activities that are unrelated to the current context, which might not be very helpful for the immediate dialogue but are naturally phrased. Therefore, the MEMORY is moderately helpful but could be improved with better organization and focus on the interaction's context."
