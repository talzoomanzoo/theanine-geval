Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?\nSpeaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping?\nSpeaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp?\nSpeaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer?\nSpeaker A: I've only camped in a tent so far, but would like to try out a camper trailer. What do use for camping?\nSpeaker B: We usually do tents but we have camped in yurts too. Did you go to the zoo last weekend?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is away from their child and glad that the pets are with them. Speaker B is considering calling in sick to work to go to the zoo with their child.\nSpeaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities. Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys. Speaker B's daughter likes monkeys and is starting to assert her independence.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information about Speaker B's interest in the zoo and their daughter, which aligns with Speaker B's mention of the zoo in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It also hints at Speaker B's relationship with their daughter, which could be useful for generating future dialogue. However, the information about Speaker A's preference for tigers and monkeys, and their weekly visits to the zoo, although pertinent to the topic of zoos, doesn't have a clear connection to the current context of camping and Speaker B's recent trip. The sentences are relatively structured and provide some context, but the overall relevancy to the specific dialogue context is limited. Therefore, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful but not maximally so."
