Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\nSpeaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\nSpeaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\nSpeaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.\nSpeaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe?\nSpeaker B: There is some weird chemical mix that I really do not mess with.  It is easy to clean up.  I try to stay away from this part of the movies.  I know what it should look like and that we want to keep everyone safe when using the fake blood.\nSpeaker A: Chemicals!  Do the actors hate working with it then?  I can imagine they are a pretty high maintenance bunch.  Do they worry about the blood messing with their looks?\nSpeaker B: Our actors are pretty amateur.  No big name ones so they are really good to work with.  Hey, how about you?  How is your interview practice going?  I am pretty sure you be excellent during it!\nSpeaker A: I think this discussion is helping me with making small talk, so thanks.  I just have to try and remember who i am and try to sell my good points.\nSpeaker B: That is a good approach.  I suppose you have been doing research on the company you are interviewing with?  I find it always helps to know the company as best you can for an interview.\nSpeaker A: Yes. Thanks for the reminder.  I have a couple of more companies to research today.  Of course, it is always interesting to figure out what a company's corporate culture is. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A used to help their father on a farm in the past, while Speaker B's dad works on smaller projects and has never been involved in a major Hollywood film. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\nSpeaker A recently moved to a new city and has two older brothers. Speaker A has recently received a call for a job interview and is excited about it. Speaker A is preparing for an upcoming interview and is nervous about it. Speaker A is nervous about an upcoming interview and wishes for a government job like Speaker B's.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Researching a company's culture is key to making a good impression. It shows you're invested in the opportunity. Good luck with your job search!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY contains some helpful information for generating a response related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it does not provide a comprehensive background or detailed insights into the dynamics of the conversation. The MEMORY notes that Speaker A is preparing for an interview and is nervous about it, which is relevant and useful because it can guide Speaker B to provide supportive or encouraging responses about interviews. It also mentions that Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, which is relevant given the part of the conversation about making horror films.\n\nHowever, several aspects of the MEMORY, such as Speaker A having two older brothers and moving to a new city, do not relate to the immediate conversation topic or aid in crafting a meaningful continuation. Additionally, the mention of Speaker A wishing for a government job like Speaker B's is irrelevant at present in guiding Speaker B's responses concerning horror movies or interviews directly. \n\nOverall, while the MEMORY includes some relevant points, it could be more focused and connected to current DIALOGUE CONTEXT themes for higher usefulness."
