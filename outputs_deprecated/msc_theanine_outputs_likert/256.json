Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\nSpeaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\nSpeaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\nSpeaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.\nSpeaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe?\nSpeaker B: There is some weird chemical mix that I really do not mess with.  It is easy to clean up.  I try to stay away from this part of the movies.  I know what it should look like and that we want to keep everyone safe when using the fake blood.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B's father's involvement in producing horror movies influenced Speaker B's favorite genre, leading them to create horror movies with their dad and come up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\nSpeaker B's government job led them to mention taking a nap during work, while Speaker A's passion for producing horror movies makes them want to create movies with Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's smart to prioritize safety on set. It's great that you have a team that takes precautions seriously.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information regarding Speaker B's background in horror movies, which is directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B discusses working on horror movie productions. The MEMORY mentions that Speaker B's father's involvement influenced their favorite genre, which can provide useful context for understanding Speaker B's current interest and passion for horror movie production. This information helps Speaker A generate more informed and connected responses.\n\nHowever, there are some less relevant details in the MEMORY, such as Speaker B taking a nap during their government job, which do not directly impact the current conversation and its context. Additionally, the mention of Speaker A's passion for producing horror movies seems inconsistent with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where it's Speaker B who is engaged in making movies, not Speaker A. These inconsistencies reduce the helpfulness, as they could potentially lead to confusion about who is involved in movie-making within the conversation.\n\nOverall, while there is some helpful information, the MEMORY could be better structured to consistently support the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and maintain clarity about the roles and interests of the speakers."
