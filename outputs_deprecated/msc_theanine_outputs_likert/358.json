    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week?\nSpeaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy playing video games in their free time. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\nSpeaker A prefers tamer video games and is not a fan of horror movies. Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World. Speaker B mentions that Resident Evil can be scary and provides some tips for playing it.\nSpeaker B plays a lot of video games, specifically League of Legends, and owns a new gaming laptop. Speaker B likes to play golf when not playing video games.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I haven't played Resident Evil yet, but I've been enjoying some other games. How was your experience with it during the storm?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides a moderate level of helpfulness for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that Speaker B enjoys playing video games, including Resident Evil, which is relevant to Speaker B's statement about recent gameplay. It also indicates that both speakers enjoy video games, which is a useful contextual point. However, many details, such as Speaker A's preferences for video games and hesitations about horror games, do not directly connect to the context of the current conversation. Additionally, some sentences about Speaker B's gaming habits and laptop ownership are not directly relevant to the ongoing dialogue, thus providing less benefit in generating a response. Overall, while there are relevant and naturally phrased details, the MEMORY could be more focused on elements that directly enhance understanding of the dialogue context."
