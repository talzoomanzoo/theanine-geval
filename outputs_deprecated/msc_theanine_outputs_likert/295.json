Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. [Speaker B has 4 brothers and sisters, enjoys taking their houseboat out, and works as a bartender.] - (SameTopic) - [Speaker A and their brother enjoy going to a Brazilian steakhouse for dinner.] - (React) - [Speaker B's brother also enjoys Brazilian food, particularly steak.] \n2. [Speaker A is involved in healing work and mentioned hot latina salsa.] - (React) - [Speaker B's sister joined them on the water and is taking a nap in a hammock.] - (SameTopic) - [Speaker B's family likes to dance on the boat at night under the stars.]\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some bits of information that could potentially be relevant to Speaker A's interest in Brazilian food, such as Speaker B's brother enjoying Brazilian food and Speaker A's preference for a Brazilian steakhouse. However, the connections between these pieces of information are not clearly developed and are scattered among unrelated details about Speaker B's family and activities that are not pertinent to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This disconnection hinders the MEMORY's usefulness in generating a coherent response, resulting in a low helpfulness score."
