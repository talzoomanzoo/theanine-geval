Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies!\nSpeaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?  \nSpeaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A loves animals, especially puppies, and visits shelters in every city they go to. Speaker B is interested in volunteering and prefers cats over dogs, especially kittens.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I guess that's true, puppies do have that adorable and energetic charm about them.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides clear and relevant information that supports the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It effectively highlights Speaker A's fondness for animals, particularly puppies, which aligns with their comments about the cute new cat not being cuter than puppies. This gives Speaker B context as to why Speaker A is so enthusiastic about puppies. Additionally, MEMORY mentions Speaker B's preference for cats, specifically kittens, which directly relates to their inquiry about the differences between kittens and puppies in the dialogue. The MEMORY entries are naturally structured, clearly showing the preferences and interests of both speakers in relation to the topic at hand, making it a useful and helpful resource for generating appropriate responses."
