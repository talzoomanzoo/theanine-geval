    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing?\nSpeaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha!\nSpeaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B recently divorced their wife and loves to scuba dive in Hawaii when not working. Speaker A does not have any pets and expresses an interest in scuba diving. Speaker B has an interest in diving and is planning to take neuroscience classes using the GI Bill. Speaker B is a veteran who went to the army after high school, interested in neuroscience and seeking advice on studying it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I find their unique personalities fascinating. Each snake has its own behavior and characteristics that make them interesting to observe.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided includes details about Speaker B's personal background, interests, and recent life events, such as their military history, interest in scuba diving, recent divorce, and plans to study neuroscience. However, these details do not directly relate to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which revolves around the topic of pet snakes. There is little information in the MEMORY that can help Speaker B generate a relevant response to Speaker A's question about the appeal of having snakes. While the memory contains relevant connections, such as shared interests between Speaker A and B in scuba diving, this does not aid in the immediate context of the conversation about pet snakes. Most of the memory details, though naturally phrased and informative, are disconnected from the current topic at hand."
