Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not!\nSpeaker B: Have you been hiking lately?\nSpeaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me.\nSpeaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway?\nSpeaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day! I'll make it as fun as possible.\nSpeaker B: I will someday. just not in the summer when all the bugs are out! Where do you go hiking the most?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it, causing Speaker A to be nervous about the Appalachian Trail hike, as they don't usually do full day hikes.\nSpeaker A has never been on a cruise, but may consider trying one in the future. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking as free activities, and also enjoys camping trips while looking for wild animals in the woods. Speaker B, on the other hand, dislikes bugs and is not a fan of camping, hiking, or the outdoors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information that can aid in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it's not completely aligned or naturally connected to the current interaction. The MEMORY notes that Speaker A enjoys hiking and Speaker B dislikes bugs and is not fond of the outdoors, which correlates with the current dialogue where Speaker B expresses disinterest in outdoor activities during the summer due to insects. However, the MEMORY also includes details that are not immediately relevant to the current conversation, such as Speaker A's feelings about cruises and long hikes, which aren't discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This extra information isn't detrimental but doesn't directly support the given dialogue. Moreover, the structure and phrasing of the MEMORY could be improved to create more evident connections and causality between the sentences, thereby enhancing its helpfulness in guiding future dialogue responses."
