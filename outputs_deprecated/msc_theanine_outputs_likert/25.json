    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\nSpeaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience. Speaker A offers to take Sparky for a walk to help out and spend time with the dog. Speaker A is considering getting a dog and already walks Speaker B's dog, Sparky. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've tried a Beyond Burger before, and I have to admit, it was surprisingly close to the real thing!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains several pieces of information about Speaker A and Speaker B's past interactions, such as Speaker B's work at a research lab, their interest in neuroscience, and the fact that Speaker A walks Speaker B's dog. However, these details are not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on the cloning of a cow, school workload, and preferences regarding different types of burgers. \n\nWhile the mention of the research lab links to Speaker B's work, it does not add depth or crucial information to the specific ongoing discussion about cloning and burgers. The other memories about dogs and a casserole don't connect to the present conversation, nor do they contribute to understanding the topics currently being discussed. The information is naturally phrased but doesn't demonstrate clear development or causality regarding Speaker A and Speaker B's interactions related to the dialogue at hand. Therefore, the MEMORY provided does not significantly help generate a proper next response for the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
