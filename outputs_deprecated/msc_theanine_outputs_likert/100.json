Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends?\nSpeaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is considering doing sledding with dogs while in Alaska, but needs to find out if it is daylight or darkness there. Speaker B's friend mentioned Alaska doesn't have 24-hour days like where they are. \nSpeaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking. Speaker B is unsure about other activities besides hiking in Alaska. \nSpeaker B is going to Alaska for a vacation in two weeks and has flying experience. Speaker A mentions outdoor activities planned for Alaska, such as hiking. \nSpeaker A has the impression that Alaska is cold and snowy, wondering if there are ski slopes there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "You should check the daylight hours in Alaska, especially if you're planning on doing activities like sledding with dogs.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It accurately captures that Speaker B is considering sledding with dogs in Alaska and needs to know about the daylight situation, which relates directly to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY also mentions that Speaker B's friend said Alaska doesn't have 24-hour days, aligning with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B talks about this information. Additionally, the MEMORY provides background about Speaker B's upcoming vacation in two weeks and their flying experience, which could be useful context for discussing the trip further.\n\nHowever, some elements in the MEMORY, like Speaker A's familiarity with fishing and hiking in Alaska and wondering about ski slopes, are not directly relevant to the immediate conversation about sledding and daylight. While these do not detract significantly, they don't enhance the relevance or development of the conversation in the current context. Hence, while the MEMORY is quite connected and naturally phrased, there are areas that could be more directly aligned with the current dialogue to make it even more helpful."
