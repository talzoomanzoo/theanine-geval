Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\nSpeaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\nSpeaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\nSpeaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.\nSpeaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe?\nSpeaker B: There is some weird chemical mix that I really do not mess with.  It is easy to clean up.  I try to stay away from this part of the movies.  I know what it should look like and that we want to keep everyone safe when using the fake blood.\nSpeaker A: Chemicals!  Do the actors hate working with it then?  I can imagine they are a pretty high maintenance bunch.  Do they worry about the blood messing with their looks?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A recently moved to a new city and has two older brothers. Speaker A has recently received a call for a job interview and is excited about it. Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations. Speaker B's father was involved in producing horror movies, which influenced Speaker B's favorite genre. Speaker A also likes mid-century design and is a fan of horror movies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "Actually, most actors are pretty chill about it. They understand it's all part of the job.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful contextual information for generating a proper next response. It indicates that Speaker B is involved in creating horror movies with their dad, which is relevant to the ongoing conversation about producing horror movies. This connection allows Speaker B to bring more personal anecdotes and insights about their creative process to the dialogue. Additionally, the fact that both speakers share an interest in horror movies could lead to a deeper discussion. However, a considerable portion of the MEMORY, such as details about Speaker A recently moving to a new city, receiving a call for a job interview, or having a passion for mid-century design, is irrelevant to the immediate dialogue context. Although these details are naturally structured within the MEMORY, they do not contribute directly to the development of the current conversation about chemistry, safety, and artistic considerations in horror movie production. Therefore, the MEMORY provides partial helpfulness in relation to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
