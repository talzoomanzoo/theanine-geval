    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play? \nSpeaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music.\nSpeaker A: ah right, who's your favourite rock band?\nSpeaker B: I'm big fan of aerosmith. When do you learn music. Whom teach you?\nSpeaker A: aerosmith are great, have you ever seen them live? I have been playing drums since i was a kid, my father taught me when I was young and from then on I just taught myself\nSpeaker B: That's awesome! I have been trying to learn last one year. Still I didn't get right teacher. I'm jealous on you. I don't have like your dad.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is in a band where they play the drums and write music, with 4 members including the singer who is their best friend. Speaker A is in a band and plays music, possibly a musician. Speaker A's band visited Italy, Uzbekistan, and smaller countries in Central and South America. \nSpeaker B was good at writing in school, while Speaker B was bad at math and preferred fishing. Speaker B is looking forward to taking a break from work and going fishing. Speaker B finds fishing easier than surfing, but is interested in trying surfing. Speaker B is willing to teach Speaker A how to fish and cook.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Don't worry, learning music takes time and patience. You'll find the right teacher eventually. Just keep practicing and you'll get there!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives background on Speaker A being in a band, playing drums, and writing music, which aligns with the dialogue where Speaker A mentions playing drums. This information about Speaker Aâ€™s musical background could be beneficial in crafting a response related to music or bands.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY also contains information about travel and fishing that appears unrelated to the current context of discussing music and playing instruments. The details about Speaker B's school subjects and fishing interest, while insightful for understanding Speaker B's character, do not contribute directly to the ongoing discussion about music and learning to play instruments.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY offers a mix of relevant and less relevant details, and while the relevant parts are helpful, the response generation could be more focused with a clearer connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
