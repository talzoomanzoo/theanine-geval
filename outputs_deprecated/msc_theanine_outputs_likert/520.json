Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer?\nSpeaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys living in a big city for the accessibility to food, live music, museums, and trying different foods. They and their boyfriend also look forward to having some refreshing beers by the beach.\nSpeaker B has 2 older and 1 younger brother, and their father used to be a farmer. They were born in Brazil, specifically in Sao Paulo. Speaker A is interested in music concerts and planning a trip to Sao Paulo to do lots of shopping. Speaker B enjoys living in the city for the accessibility to food and live music, and is waiting for bands to announce their summer tour schedule to plan which shows to attend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides several pieces of information that can be helpful for generating a proper next response relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions both Speaker A's and Speaker B's interests in music concerts and live music, which is directly related to the context of Speaker A asking about a music concert. It also provides information about Speaker A's interest in museums, which connects to Speaker B's question about what sort of art museum Speaker A is going to. \n\nThe MEMORY includes relevant details about Speaker B's anticipation for upcoming summer concert announcements, which aligns with the topic of a summer concert asked about in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, details about both speakers enjoying city life for its amenities, such as food and live music, are naturally phrased and provide a background that may inform future dialogue decisions. Even the less directly relevant details, like Speaker A planning a trip to Sao Paulo, are phrased naturally, helping to easily distinguish which information may not be immediately relevant. \n\nOverall, the MEMORY is quite helpful in providing context and continuity for the ongoing conversation, even if some details (like family background) are not directly relevant to the immediate topic of conversation."
