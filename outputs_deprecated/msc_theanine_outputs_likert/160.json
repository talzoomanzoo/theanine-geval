Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it!\nSpeaker B: I'm glad you liked it. My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to?\nSpeaker A: I recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca. It was super cute and made me want to go visit Italy, but that was too expensive, so instead I booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month. What about you?\nSpeaker B: I have been relaxing with the kids as much as I have. My husband has been busy with work, so we haven't had time for anything big. I would love to visit Italy some day though if we get the chance. Have you ever been to Italy before?\nSpeaker A: I have never gone to Italy because I'm always so busy. If I ever go, I would want to spend a month there, but work has been hectic lately. Would your kids go with you if you went to Italy?\nSpeaker B: Absolutely! I'd love to travel all over the world with my family to see everything. Hawaii sounds like just as much fun though. What are you most excited about doing when you get there?\nSpeaker A: I'm extremely excited about the sunset tour. Each day is at a new location to watch the sunset. It's suppose to be romantic, but I am just going alone, so I see it as more calming than anything.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys watching movies with her kids, which is why Speaker B's kids enjoy watching Disney movies and Speaker B also finds them good. This caused Speaker A to see the Disney movie 'Luca' recently.\nSpeaker B is a stay-at-home mom, leading her kids to enjoy watching Disney movies, which Speaker B also finds good. As a result, Speaker B's kids enjoyed watching 'Luca' and said it was good.\nSpeaker B enjoys watching movies with her kids, which made Speaker A enjoy watching sunsets and mention seeing a great sunset recently. This made Speaker A book a \"Hawaii Sunset\" tour for next month, being excited about it being their first time.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds lovely! I'm sure it will be a peaceful and beautiful experience for you. Make sure to take lots of pictures to remember it by.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains some relevant information, such as Speaker B's enjoyment of watching movies with her kids and the connection to Disney movies, which is somewhat helpful to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY is mostly disjointed and doesn't accurately capture the conversation's progression or causality. Some information is irrelevant or inaccurately described, such as suggesting that Speaker B influenced Speaker A's desire to watch sunsets, which lacks a clear connection to the current conversation. Additionally, the overly repetitive points about Disney movies and inaccuracies about events reduce the helpfulness of this MEMORY for generating coherent and contextually appropriate responses. Overall, the MEMORY lacks coherence and does not effectively enhance the language model's understanding, thus warranting a score of 2."
