Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies!\nSpeaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?  \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A, an inventor working on a time machine, enjoys teleporting worldwide and loves animals, especially puppies. They frequently visit shelters in different cities to care for dogs and cats, particularly excited about new puppies. \nSpeaker B, a 26-year-old workaholic unsure about their career, is interested in volunteering and leans towards cats, especially kittens, over dogs. They don't have strong opinions on puppies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information that can aid Speaker A, representing the language model, in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY establishes that Speaker A loves puppies and often cares for both dogs and cats at shelters. This information aligns with Speaker A's comment in the dialogue about the new cat not being cuter than puppies. The MEMORY also reveals that Speaker B leans towards a preference for cats, which corresponds to their questioning the differences between kittens and puppies. The MEMORY is structured in a way that clearly outlines the interests and tendencies of both speakers, which enhances the understanding of their interaction, making it particularly useful for generating relevant responses. Despite some sentences not being directly related to the current dialogue (e.g., Speaker A's inventing activities), they are naturally phrased, and the model can easily filter them out if necessary. Overall, MEMORY is highly relevant and well-structured, which contributes to the conversation."
