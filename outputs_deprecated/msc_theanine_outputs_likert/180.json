Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know. \nSpeaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like.\nSpeaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too.\nSpeaker B: Nice! Is anyone coming with you?\nSpeaker A: Just my doggy Drunky.  You never know,  I might meet a nice lady out there. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys Mexican food and drinks, and plays music for fun. Speaker A also enjoys going to bars and loves the ladies. Both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n\nSpeaker A owns a Subaru Legacy and mentions having a baby on the way. Speaker B is not going out drinking much due to their wife's pregnancy. Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day. Speaker A is not sure if they will ever settle down with a partner and have kids.\n\nSpeaker B is a mechanic who enjoys working on cars. Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Sounds like a plan! It'll be fun to enjoy the festival with your dog and who knows, maybe you'll meet someone special.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that helps understand the dynamic between Speaker A and Speaker B, which could be useful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It specifies their shared interest in bluegrass music, which is relevant to the current context of discussing a music festival. Additionally, it covers Speaker B's wife's pregnancy, which is a critical factor influencing Speaker B's decision-making and aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT wherein Speaker B is considering a more comfortable way for his pregnant wife to attend the event. \n\nHowever, much of the other information, such as Speaker A's enjoyment of Mexican food and drinks, or his uncertainty about settling down, does not contribute directly to this specific context. Also, the mention of Speaker B's occupation as a mechanic and feelings of jealousy do not enhance understanding of their current conversation or improve Speaker B's potential responses. The MEMORY's structure is somewhat disjointed and could be better connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT for a higher score."
