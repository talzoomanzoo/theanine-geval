Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well?\nSpeaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes?\nSpeaker A: I want to take some martial art classes at school next year. What do you sggest I try?\nSpeaker B: I mean I always recommend Karate since that's what I study! I can bring you by the dojo sometime if you want to see what it is like. \nSpeaker A: OMG!! That would be so awesome, Yes please.  When is a good time for you?\nSpeaker B: Awesome! Tomorrow afternoon anytime between 3-6 would work for me!\nSpeaker A: Perfect. I will meet you at the Dojo at 3pm. I really appriciate it, and I will buy you lunch after too. \nSpeaker B: That's great! I can bring some guest passes to the pool I lifeguard at as well! I'm working this weekend if you want to come when I am working. Where do you want to eat?\nSpeaker A: I defiantly will. As well a bucket of sunscreen, safety in the sun first.  I was thinking that new sandwhich shop by the collage that just opened, what do nyou think? \nSpeaker B: Oh yeah gotta bring that SPF 100! The new deli sounds great. I have been craving cold cuts! \nSpeaker A: I personally use SPF Vampire HAHA! Fantastic. Yeah they have this Italian sub im dying to try.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, who used to be the captain of a football team and is currently a lifeguard, has transitioned to signing up for classes at the local college. They have a background in football and karate, and now they are considering a career change to the IT sector due to their computer skills and the demand for employees in that field. Speaker B also practices karate and holds a green belt, while attending football games at their old high school and finding that their football background helps in karate footwork.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm sure you'll love the Italian sub at the deli! Looking forward to showing you around the dojo tomorrow.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful context about Speaker B that could be useful for generating a next response in the dialogue. It mentions their background in football and karate, which supports their recommendation of karate to Speaker A. Additionally, Speaker B's current status as a lifeguard and their engagement with the local college corresponds to the conversation about bringing guest passes to the pool and the mention of the new sandwich shop by the college. However, some aspects of the MEMORY, such as Speaker B's consideration of a career change to the IT sector, are not relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and do not contribute much to developing the current interaction between Speaker A and Speaker B. Overall, while the MEMORY contains relevant information, the connection between certain elements and the dialogue context isn't as strong or comprehensive, resulting in a middling score."
