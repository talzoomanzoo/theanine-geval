Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships!\nSpeaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!   I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field?\nSpeaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate?\nSpeaker B: I have another year- so this year is really important I get internships and start making connections in the field.   I love going to the beach too.  What happened with your knees that now cause you so much pain?\nSpeaker A: I think age has really been my knees downfall. I also used to hike a lot and I put a lot of pressure on my legs. That is great that you only have a year. Maybe when you graduate you can come hang out on the beach with me. I can't surf but I would love to watch you.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A mentions their neighbor John who loves soccer, which causes Speaker B to be interested in sports medicine and enjoy surfing. This leads Speaker A to offer advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field.\n\nSpeaker B's mother runs a local high school, and Speaker B is her only child. This connection leads Speaker B to go to the beach a lot and learn to surf from friends in Jersey. Speaker A suggests that surfing could be a way for Speaker B to make connections in the medical field.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a plan! I'll definitely take you up on that offer to hang out at the beach after I graduate. It'll be a nice break from the internship hunt.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context regarding Speaker B's interest in sports and surfing, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B expresses interest in internships in their field and enjoys going to the beach. These elements could help a language model generate responses that involve sports medicine, surfing, or beach activities. However, some details in MEMORY, such as Speaker B's mother's profession and Speaker A's advice about making connections through surfing, aren't directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT where the focus is more on internships and Speaker A's past career and knee problems. The MEMORY mentions 'John' and Speaker B's interest in sports medicine, but it lacks the explicit connection to Speaker B's current search for internships in the medical field. Overall, while some connections are present, the MEMORY could be more directly aligned with the current discussion to be more helpful."
