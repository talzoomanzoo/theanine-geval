Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself!\nSpeaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food?\nSpeaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too?\nSpeaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also?\nSpeaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways?\nSpeaker B: They've been better as I left my previous job so I'm spending more time with them, how do you manage to work full time and still keep those animals happy?\nSpeaker A: I think working at the zoo so long has helped. Why did you leave your last job. Was that the one you were working in the warehouse? Sorry to hear about your dogs, it can be hard managing older animals.\nSpeaker B: Yea, that totally makes sense! I just wanted time off to spend with the dogs and look for a better job elsewhere, I'm hoping that I'll be able to get a job outside of a warehouse!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is looking for a new job and is excited about the opportunity at the zoo. Speaker B has elderly terriers and is planning to leave their part-time job for a break before starting a new one. \nSpeaker A works at a zoo and has tried playing music for the white tigers and home concerts for their pets. Speaker A works at a zoo and is willing to help Speaker B get an entry-level position there. \nSpeaker A has penguins at the zoo and enjoys working with animals, offering Speaker B a chance to help out. Speaker B is grateful for the opportunity and is looking forward to playing music for the animals, starting with something safer than the white tiger.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Taking time off to spend with your dogs sounds like a great idea. I hope you find a job that you'll enjoy more.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information that are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, including the details about Speaker B looking for a new job and Speaker A's work at the zoo. However, the MEMORIES about playing music for tigers or penguins, offering the opportunity to help at the zoo, and Speaker B's excitement and gratitude are not directly mentioned in the dialogue context and thus do not directly aid in generating a response. The structure of the memory could be improved to clearly connect past interactions to the ongoing conversation and provide more relevant contextual cues. Overall, it provides some helpful context but lacks explicit relevance and development to elevate the engagement with the dialogue context to a higher level."
