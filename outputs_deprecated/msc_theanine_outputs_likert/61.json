Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\nSpeaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk?\nSpeaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous.\nSpeaker B: That sounds amazing! Did you bring a pet? I love doing the harder trails with my dog. Sometimes, it's very peaceful to get away from everything.\nSpeaker A: No, I don't have any pets; my apartment seems too small for a dog and I would worry about them being lonely all day when I'm at work. I was thinking about getting a pair of cats, but I haven't committed yet. How nice fo ryou to have company when you're walking though! What kind of dog do you have?\nSpeaker B: Cats can be nice! I used to have cats, but am allergic to them and had to give them to my friend. I have an Australian Kelpie who is a rescue. She is very energetic and smart!\nSpeaker A: I had cats as a child and I think that they're a bit easier to care for than dogs, especially in the city. I am a dog lover as well though; Australian Kelpies are gorgeous! What is her name? Does she walk well off-leash?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, who lives in the country, loves nature, and works with animals, enjoys walking through nature for work. Speaker A, a city dweller who walks to work instead of driving, is interested in Pilates but dislikes the idea of having to follow specific steps in exercise. Speaker A, who also enjoyed reading 'Redwall' growing up and keeps an eye out for similar books, recommends \"A Game of Thrones\" by George R. Speaker A, a fan of the Game of Thrones series and audiobooks, acknowledges Speaker B's need for inspiration and asks about their new artwork.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Her name is Luna, and she does walk well off-leash! She's very obedient and loves exploring the trails with me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some relevant information about Speaker A and Speaker B, but it is not particularly helpful for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY includes details about Speaker B's love for nature and their work with animals, which could relate to their interest in nature walks. However, the rest of the details, like Speaker A's interests in Pilates, 'Redwall' and 'Game of Thrones', and Speaker B's artwork, are not pertinent to the conversation about nature walks and pets. Moreover, the sentences do not clearly demonstrate a connection or development related to the dialogue context, making it difficult for a language model to extract useful context. Therefore, the MEMORY earns a low score for not offering relevant, structured information that aids in generating the next response."
