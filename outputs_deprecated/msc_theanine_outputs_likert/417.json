Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin!\nSpeaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name? \nSpeaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls! \nSpeaker B: I see what you meant. Plus the color is beautiful orange. I want to see them together, even I am not a cat person they must be cute together at that time. Once the kitten grows up, situation gonna change to me. How are they, they are doing well?\nSpeaker A: Marmalade is orange too but this is better because the baby is sassy and climbs up my leg to sit on my shoulder. I don't understand how you are not a cat person when you have such a large heart for stray kittens.\nSpeaker B: hehe you're right. But i can't explain that why I am not a cat person to you sorry. How's the weather like today, still good weather to have iced tea out there?\n\nMEMORY:\n- Speaker A recently visited a hair salon and now has a kitten from their cat, enjoying taking them on trips. Speaker A used to leave their cats with a friend while traveling, but now they bring the kitten along.\n- Speaker B loves dogs, yet Speaker A and Speaker B have a light-hearted and humorous conversation about their pets and travels. Speaker A used to leave their cats with a friend while traveling, but now they bring the kitten along.\n- Speaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten and mentions having a Mini car, smaller compared to Speaker B's Subaru. Speaker A changed from having a Subaru and a cat named Ginger to considering naming a new kitten Marmalade.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "The weather is perfect for iced tea, not too hot or too cold. I might just enjoy a glass with Pumpkin lounging by my side.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains useful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the fact that Speaker A has a kitten, which is relevant to the ongoing conversation about naming the kitten. The memories about taking the kitten along on trips and Speaker A's previous name considerations for the kitten (Marmalade) also align with the context. The mention of Speaker B loving dogs provides a slight indication of why they might not be a 'cat person', though it's not fully delved into. However, many details in the MEMORY such as Speaker A visiting a hair salon, the types of cars owned, and previous travel habits with pets, do not directly inform the current conversation. Some sentences are repetitive, and there could be more specificity regarding past interactions. Overall, the MEMORY contains elements that are moderately helpful, but they are not all directly relevant or necessary for generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
