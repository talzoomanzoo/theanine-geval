Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well?\nSpeaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes?\nSpeaker A: I want to take some martial art classes at school next year. What do you sggest I try?\nSpeaker B: I mean I always recommend Karate since that's what I study! I can bring you by the dojo sometime if you want to see what it is like. \nSpeaker A: OMG!! That would be so awesome, Yes please.  When is a good time for you?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, who has a background in football and karate, signed up for classes at the local college and is currently a lifeguard at the beach. Speaker B is considering a career change to the IT sector due to their computer skills and the growing demand for employees in that sector. Additionally, Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information about Speaker B's involvement in karate, which is directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B recommends karate and offers to show Speaker A the dojo. This connection helps in generating a response since it aligns with Speaker B's background and current activities. However, the MEMORY also includes details about Speaker B's work as a lifeguard, interests in IT, and educational pursuits, which are not directly relevant to the dialogue about martial arts. These details are naturally phrased but could be seen as extraneous to the immediate conversation, potentially providing minor distractions instead of support for generating a response. Hence, the MEMORY is partially helpful."
