Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know. \n\nMEMORY:\n- Speaker A frequents live band venues and plays music at home. Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby. \n- Speaker A does not live in Mexico but likes Mexican food and women. Speaker B is not going out drinking much due to their wife's pregnancy. Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day. Speaker B's wife is pregnant and has three more months to go until the due date. \n- Speaker B is a mechanic who enjoys working on cars. Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Hey, that sounds like a great idea! I'll check with my wife and let you know. Thanks for the offer.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that can aid in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it highlights that Speaker B's wife is pregnant, and they have been considering attending a local festival for just a day due to this, which directly relates to the suggestion about the cabin accommodation for the Bluegrass show. Additionally, it mentions that Speaker B enjoys bluegrass music, which is pertinent to the conversation about attending a Bluegrass show. However, there are other details in the memory that seem less relevant to the immediate context, such as Speaker A's interest in Mexican food and women, or the fact that Speaker B is a mechanic. Overall, the memory has a mix of relevant and irrelevant information, and while the structured details about pregnancy and logistics offer helpful context, the unrelated details somewhat dilute its focus."
