Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A met their neighbor John who loves soccer, which led Speaker B to study sports medicine and play soccer, with a goal to join their college team in the future. As a result, Speaker B's professors have been supportive in writing letters for an internship application. This situation prompted Speaker A to offer advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, emphasizing the medical field.\nSpeaker B, a college student who used to play soccer with other students, transitioned into looking for internships in the sports medicine field and sought letters of recommendation from professors. Consequently, Speaker B's professors have been supportive in writing letters for an internship application. In reaction, Speaker B is struggling with finding internships and feeling disadvantaged compared to others with connections.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "That's amazing, thank you so much for the connection! I'll definitely reach out to them to explore internship opportunities in the sports medicine field.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a fairly well-connected narrative that establishes Speaker B's background in soccer and sports medicine, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about potential internships. The MEMORY describes the process that led Speaker B from playing soccer to pursuing a career in sports medicine, including seeking internships and requesting letters of recommendation. This context is helpful for generating a response that addresses the opportunity mentioned by Speaker A. However, there is some repetition and could have been slightly more concise or focused on variant aspects of their interaction. Overall, the MEMORY aligns well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and provides valuable background information about Speaker B's interests and challenges, offering clarity on their current situation. Thus, it earns a high score for helpfully informing the generation of a next response."
