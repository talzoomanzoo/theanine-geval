Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it!\nSpeaker B: I'm glad you liked it. My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to?\nSpeaker A: I recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca. It was super cute and made me want to go visit Italy, but that was too expensive, so instead I booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month. What about you?\nSpeaker B: I have been relaxing with the kids as much as I have. My husband has been busy with work, so we haven't had time for anything big. I would love to visit Italy some day though if we get the chance. Have you ever been to Italy before?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has seen the Disney movie 'Luca' recently, which made them want to go visit Italy, but instead, they booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month.\nSpeaker B's kids enjoy watching Disney movies, which Speaker B also finds good. They all enjoyed watching 'Luca', and her husband loved it too.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures key details about Speaker A’s recent experience with the Disney movie 'Luca' and their decision to book a Hawaii sunset tour, which ties directly into the specific details mentioned in the conversation. Despite a minor incorrect statement about Speaker B’s family's viewing of 'Luca'—(only 'Miracle' was discussed as being watched by Speaker B's family in the dialogue)—the MEMORY generally reflects the past interactions about movie preferences and future travel plans. The structure aids in identifying important contextual cues like Speaker A's travel plans and mutual interest in Disney movies, enabling potential continuations of the conversation. However, the inaccuracy related to 'Luca' slightly impacts the memory's precision."
