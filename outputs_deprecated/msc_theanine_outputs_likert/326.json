    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume.\nSpeaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment. \nSpeaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has visited 20 countries and enjoys the color turquoise. Speaker B enjoys traveling and visiting gardens. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully. \nSpeaker A enjoys art and music, specifically painting. Speaker A is working on painting projects in their craft room. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next. Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information that could potentially aid Speaker B in generating an appropriate response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, knowing that Speaker A enjoys origami and has tried making a lotus flower successfully can help Speaker B continue the conversation about origami and potential next steps or interests. However, the MEMORY also includes details that are not connected to the current context, such as Speaker B enjoying the color turquoise and traveling, which do not directly relate to the ongoing conversation. Additionally, some information is duplicated, which detracts from the overall usefulness. Overall, while the MEMORY has relevant information, it lacks a strong connection or causality that would make it highly helpful, leading to a mid-range score."
