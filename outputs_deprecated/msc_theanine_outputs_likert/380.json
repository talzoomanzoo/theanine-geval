Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is planning to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest, as it is their favorite tattoo dedicated to their late father. \nSpeaker A, who has 5 tattoos including one dedicated to their late father, has decided to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That would be a meaningful tattoo to have for your wife or sons. It's a great way to carry them with you wherever you go.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information regarding Speaker A's intention to honor their parents through tattoos, which is the focus of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It clarifies that Speaker A already has a tattoo dedicated to their late father and is planning to add a portrait of their father's face alongside the existing slogan on their chest. However, the MEMORY is somewhat repetitive and does not provide additional new information beyond reinforcing the details about the tattoo for Speaker A's father. It does not address Speaker A's consideration of a tattoo for their mother, which is also mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Providing more varied insights or developments about Speaker A's plans could further enhance its helpfulness. Thus, I rate its helpfulness as 3."
