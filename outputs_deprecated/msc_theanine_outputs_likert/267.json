Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go?\nSpeaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \nSpeaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is studying sports medicine in college, which causes Speaker A to wish for better grades and hope for a soccer scholarship. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and excels only in gym class.\n\nSpeaker B, who is studying sports medicine in college, finds history class boring just like Speaker A. Both of them are dealing with the challenges of school. Speaker B, feeling overwhelmed by their mother's strictness, is eager to finish school to escape it.\n\nSpeaker B's dedication to studying sports medicine in college has resulted in getting all A's in the class. This success puts pressure on Speaker B to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother, who happens to run the school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some level of helpful information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It reveals that Speaker B is dedicated to their studies in sports medicine and struggles with pressure from their family, which could relate to their current stress during finals. This context might help in generating empathetic responses or understanding Speaker B's motivation and pressure. However, the MEMORY mostly focuses on Speaker B's academic pursuits and personal challenges, which are not directly relevant to Speaker A's current situation with their history exam or upcoming finals. Overall, the MEMORY gives moderate context to understand Speaker B's character and pressures, but does not directly enhance the ability to generate a response specifically tailored to Speaker A's immediate academic situation in the dialogue."
