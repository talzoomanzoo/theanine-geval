Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive.\nSpeaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price?\nSpeaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music\nSpeaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it.\nSpeaker A: I'll keep trying! Have you had any luck lately?\nSpeaker B: No I haven't! I keep hoping that I will so I can buy my dreamhouse but I know the chances are low.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B have a friendly interaction and part ways on a positive note. They discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\n\nSpeaker A and Speaker B have a friendly interaction and part ways on a positive note. They both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n\nSpeaker A, who has never been to college and values the peaceful life of working on the farm, suggests that Speaker B and their family could stay over at the farm after the concert. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\n\nSpeaker A, who has never been to college and values the peaceful life of working on the farm, is open to moving to the country to be further away from neighbors. Speaker B, in turn, bought 20 lotto tickets with the same numbers, aiming to get a bigger share of the jackpot if they win.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically about Speaker A and Speaker B's conversations regarding the lottery. However, the MEMORY is somewhat repetitive and lacks clarity in demonstrating the development or progression of interactions between the two speakers. The repetitions about playing the lotto and positive interactions do not significantly aid in generating a specific or enriched next response in the context given. The mention of college, working on the farm, and moving to the country are irrelevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about purchasing an expensive iPhone and listening to music. These points do not aid in understanding the current sentiment or context of the conversation, thus limiting the MEMORY's usefulness. Improvements could be made by focusing more on the existing dialogue context and exploring the impacts or reasons behind their lotto discussions, enhancing coherence and relevancy."
