Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons\nSpeaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use.\nSpeaker B: I am a little scared of needles though. Were your tattoos painful?\nSpeaker A: Most of them were not.  It really depends on where on your body you get them.  Most of mine are on areas that didn't hurt.  The one on my foot and the one behind my ear did hurt a good bit.  Where were you thinking about getting it?\nSpeaker B: I hadn't really thought about it! Maybe upper arm or upper back? But I'm no tattoo expert. And I'd have to get permission from my wife first, LOL\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a total of 5 tattoos and enjoys getting them, with one dedicated to their late father. They plan to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan already tattooed on their chest. Speaker A's favorite tattoo is the one dedicated to their late father, with the phrase \"for you I shall live\". They are working at a coffee shop to save up for their next tattoo.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "Upper arm or upper back are great choices for a first tattoo, not too painful. And getting permission from your wife is always a good idea!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information that aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It reveals that Speaker A already has a tattoo dedicated to their late father, which is relevant to their discussion of getting a matching tattoo for their mom. It also mentions Speaker A's interest and enjoyment in getting tattoos, which is helpful context for the conversation about tattoo experiences and locations. However, some parts of the MEMORY, like working at a coffee shop to save up for the next tattoo, while naturally phrased, aren't directly relevant to the current dialogue context. Nonetheless, the MEMORY is overall structured in a coherent and relevant manner, aiding in generating a proper next response."
