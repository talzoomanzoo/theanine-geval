Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know. \nSpeaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like.\nSpeaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too.\nSpeaker B: Nice! Is anyone coming with you?\nSpeaker A: Just my doggy Drunky.  You never know,  I might meet a nice lady out there. \nSpeaker B: Totally.  There will be a bunch of women there and it'll be easy to strike up conversations.  Just be confident and I'm sure you could walk away with a bunch of numbers.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a mechanic who enjoys working on cars, while Speaker A frequents live band venues, plays music at home, and both enjoy bluegrass music.\n2. Speaker A owns a Subaru Legacy and mentions having a baby on the way, causing Speaker B to not go out drinking much due to their wife's pregnancy. As a result, Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day, which is a topic where Speaker A is not sure if they will ever settle down with a partner and have kids.\n3. Speaker A does not live in Mexico but likes Mexican food and women, which changed to enjoying going to bars and loving the ladies. Speaker B, on the other hand, dislikes public transportation and enjoys going to festivals but misses doing so.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks, I'll keep that in mind. Who knows, maybe I'll find someone who loves bluegrass music as much as I do.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant background information about Speaker A's and Speaker B's interests, such as their mutual enjoyment of bluegrass music, which aligns with the topic of the bluegrass show in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY lacks a strong, cohesive narrative or clear connections between the sentences that would aid in generating a natural and contextually relevant next response. Some information, like Speaker A's interest in Mexican food or Speaker B's dislike for public transportation, seems disconnected from the current dialogue and doesn't contribute much to understanding the context or guiding the next response. While there are glimpses of useful information, the MEMORY overall isn't structured in a way that clearly demonstrates the development of past interactions relevant to the current context, hence the score of 2."
