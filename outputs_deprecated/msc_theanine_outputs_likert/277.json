Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her?\nSpeaker B: Hi there, hope you are wlll and managing to save up for your Italy trip?  Thank for asking about the Greek mythology study, we are doing very well. It helps because i am so passionate about it and hope to get to the Greek islands soon\nSpeaker A: Yes I have been saving up for another trip to Italy! I can't wait. It's planned for next Spring. Do you have any plans to go back to Italy in the future?\nSpeaker B: I would love to get back to Italy but need to save up and the hopeful priority is to Greece this year.  You have friends in Europe are you in contact to see what plans you can make?\nSpeaker A: Yes I've been talking to them quite a bit so they know what's going on. I'll be staying with some of them while I'm over there. I have never been to Greece....I'd like to go though. Maybe I'll add it to my itinerary! Maybe we could plan to be in Greece at the same time?!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is excited for their upcoming trip to Italy next Spring and has been saving up for it. They have friends in Europe who they have been in contact with to make plans. Speaker B, on the other hand, is interested in visiting Greece this year due to their passion for Greek mythology.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY effectively provides helpful information for Speaker B to generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It succinctly summarizes the key points of the conversation: Speaker A's excitement for their Italy trip and their connections with friends in Europe, and Speaker B's interest in visiting Greece due to their passion for Greek mythology. This MEMORY captures the relevant details and development of the conversation, making it easy for the language model to identify contextual cues and build upon the established dialogue. The sentences are structured naturally and connected logically, offering a clear representation of both speakers' plans and interests as they relate to the ongoing conversation."
