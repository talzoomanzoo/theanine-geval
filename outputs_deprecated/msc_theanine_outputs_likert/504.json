Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive.\nSpeaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price?\nSpeaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music\nSpeaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it.\nSpeaker A: I'll keep trying! Have you had any luck lately?\nSpeaker B: No I haven't! I keep hoping that I will so I can buy my dreamhouse but I know the chances are low.\nSpeaker A: Would you move to the city? It'd be too much for me\nSpeaker B: I would love to be able to have a country house and a city house to be able to come and go to each one as I please. doesn't that sound like a dream come true?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A suggests that Speaker B's kids could try milking cows on the farm, which Speaker B finds amusing. They then discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\n\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n\nSpeaker A, who has never been to college and values the peaceful life of working on the farm, suggests that Speaker B and their family could stay over at the farm after the concert. Additionally, both speakers dream of having a city and country house or a summer and winter home.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures relevant past interactions between Speaker A and Speaker B, specifically their discussions about buying lotto tickets and dreaming of having a city and country house. These details are naturally integrated, supporting the conversation about winning the lotto and purchasing dreamhouses. Additionally, the MEMORY mentions Speaker A's appreciation for the peaceful life on the farm, which can relate to their reluctance about city living. While not every sentence in MEMORY is directly related to the specific conversation about the new iPhone, the overall context helps in understanding their shared dreams and aspirations. The only minor issue is the mention of milking cows, which is unrelated to the current dialogue, preventing a perfect score."
