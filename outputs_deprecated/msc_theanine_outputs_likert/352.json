Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on!\nSpeaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar.\nSpeaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general?\nSpeaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts.\nSpeaker A: How's learning to bake going in general, especially now that you're off desserts?\nSpeaker B: I one of those people how have to fail a couple of times before I get the hang of it, but I'm getting there.  Have you and the kids had any chance to go skiing lately?\nSpeaker A: Water skiing? Yes, last weekend. It was so much fun!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "Water skiing sounds like a blast! I bet it was a great way to enjoy the weekend.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful context, particularly regarding Speaker A's strong connection to jello and their familial association with it through their grandmother. This connects directly with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Speaker B is discussing teaching their kids a jello recipe passed down from their grandmother, emphasizing family traditions. However, the suggestion that Speaker B can consider Speaker A's grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes, while potentially providing a friendly angle to the conversation, doesn't directly tie back to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT or advance it.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides relevant background for Speaker A's perspective on jello, but the interaction details between the speakers aren't fully developed or as directly connected to the conversation flow in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Thus, it scores a 3 for partial helpfulness."
