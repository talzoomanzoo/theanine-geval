Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself!\nSpeaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food?\nSpeaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A loves animals, especially white tigers. Speaker A mentions having dogs and Speaker B admires them for their peaceful nature. Speaker B asks Speaker A if they have had a pet raccoon before.\nSpeaker A's pet raccoon enjoys eating pizza, which causes Speaker A's friend to find two baby raccoons in her yard, one of which was given to Speaker A to keep as a pet.\nSpeaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid, which causes Speaker B to ask Speaker A if they have had a pet raccoon before.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, my dogs can be quite sneaky when it comes to food. I have to be careful where I leave things around the house.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it clarifies who Journey is, as the memory refers to Speaker A having a pet raccoon named Journey, which is directly relevant to the discussion about Journey eating pizza. This connection helps Speaker B generate a more informed response. However, the MEMORY also includes unrelated information about white tigers, bearded dragons, and a somewhat repetitive question about having a pet raccoon before, which doesn't add value to the dialogue context. The memory could be more helpful if it focused more on the relationship between Speaker A and Journey, or any past incidents of Journey getting into food, to better align with the ongoing conversation. Overall, the MEMORY is partially helpful but could be improved for better coherence and relevance to the context."
