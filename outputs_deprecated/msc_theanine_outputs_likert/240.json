Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys camping and hiking as free activities, which is why they have planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "Sounds like you're all set for your camping trips! Have you checked the weather forecast for those days?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful contextual information about Speaker A's interest in camping and hiking, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A discusses preparing for a potential outdoor activity involving mosquitoes. The fact that Speaker A enjoys camping and has planned trips, including a hike on the Appalachian Trail, can inform the tone and content of Speaker B's response, perhaps by acknowledging Speaker A's enthusiasm for these activities.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY could be more directly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT by perhaps mentioning issues like past experiences with mosquitoes or how Speaker A prepares for such trips. While the memory information is relevant to the general theme of outdoor activities, its direct contribution to guiding the generation of a specific response to the current dialogue is somewhat limited. The MEMORY is structured well enough to hint at the type of activities Speaker A engages in, but a deeper connection or causality could enhance its relevance to the dialogue context further."
