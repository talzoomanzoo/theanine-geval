Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \nSpeaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!).\nSpeaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol\nSpeaker B: I am up for the challenge! I have a few tricks up my sleeve to deal with people like you.\nSpeaker A: Oh geez that makes me sound difficult.lol  Do you have any new speeches coming up?\nSpeaker B: Nope, I just cleared my schedule until the Alps marathon that you're training for. It's just you and me until you break that finish line. I'm going to start sending you a motivational quote every morning at 4 am when I want you to wake up.\nSpeaker A: Wow 4 am.  Is it too late to change my mind?lol\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys fishing and the outdoors, while Speaker B has run a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding. Speaker A is training for marathons and seeking advice on how to recover, and Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600. \nSpeaker A dislikes traveling but has visited 20 countries, and Speaker A is working on improving their mile time and training for a marathon, which causes Speaker A to seek advice on recovery. Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600. \nSpeaker A dislikes traveling but has visited 20 countries, and Speaker B has run a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding. Speaker A is training for marathons and seeking advice on how to recover, while Speaker B is considering running a marathon and mentioned fishing and feeling depressed.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains information that is somewhat helpful for generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it could be improved in terms of structure and relevance. There are several points in the MEMORY that could be considered beneficial:\n\n1. **Speaker A is training for marathons** - This correlates with the dialogue context where Speaker A mentions training for the Alps marathon, indicating a continuous theme of marathon training in their conversations.\n2. **Speaker B has run a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding** - This piece of memory gives Speaker B credibility when discussing motivations related to running or marathons.\n3. **Invitation to run together and train for the Alps marathon** - This is directly relevant since the dialogue context involves the Alps marathon mention.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY is scattered and contains redundant information (e.g., Speaker A's dislike for traveling yet having visited 20 countries appears twice and is not directly related to the current dialogue context), and it needs better organization to enhance its helpfulness score. Additionally, the references to scheduling and motivational tactics are missing in MEMORY, which could have further strengthened the connection to the dialogue context. Improving the cohesiveness and direct relevance would increase the helpfulness score."
