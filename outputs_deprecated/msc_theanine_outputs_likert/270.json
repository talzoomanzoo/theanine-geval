Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go?\nSpeaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \nSpeaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on?\nSpeaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study?\nSpeaker B: Ah, English should be easier than History. Sure, I can help you. What do you need to do exactly? Write an essay?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, we have to write an essay and we have a spelling component towards the end of the exam, I sure could use a little help!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is studying sports medicine in college, while Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring. Speaker B feels overwhelmed by their mother's strictness and looks forward to finishing school to escape it.\nSpeaker A believes that sports demonstrate how everyone can work together equally. Speaker B, who is training in sports medicine, feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother, who is in charge of the school.\nSpeaker B plays soccer and is an only child, while Speaker A hopes to improve their grades and aims for a soccer scholarship. Speaker B realizes the necessity of discussing the pressure they face with their mother.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Of course, I'd be happy to help you with studying for your English final. Just let me know when you're free to go over everything.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some potentially useful background information about Speaker B studying sports medicine and Speaker A's struggle with history, which could relate to the mentioned exams. However, most of the details in MEMORY do not directly help generate a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY lacks a structured connection to the dialogue, as it focuses more on external pressures, family expectations, and personal interests like sports and scholarships, which do not appear relevant to the ongoing exchange about exams and study assistance. The lack of clear, naturally structured connections between MEMORY and DIALOGUE CONTEXT lowers its helpfulness."
