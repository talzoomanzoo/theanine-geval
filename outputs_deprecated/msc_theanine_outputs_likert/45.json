    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs. Speaker A hosts football parties and loves football season. Speaker A feeds the horses grass roughage with some grains, particularly oats. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology. Speaker A is involved in horse breeding and taking care of horses. Speaker A works at a stable and enjoys being around horses. Speaker B is concerned about the cost of owning horses, including medical fees and expenses like horse shoes. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's great that you found a career that aligns with your passion for helping others. Do you find that being a therapist is rewarding?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It offers background on Speaker B's profession as a therapist, which aligns with Speaker B's response about wanting to help people and enjoying listening and talking to them. Additionally, it mentions Speaker A's involvement with horses, which is not directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about becoming a therapist, but it could be useful in future interactions or conversations where the topic might shift to Speaker A's interests or expertise. However, much of the MEMORY content focuses on Speaker A's knowledge of horses and football, which is not directly linked to the current topic of Speaker B's career choice. The MEMORY could be more cohesive and explicitly related to the context of becoming a therapist to warrant a higher score. Overall, it provides a mixture of relevant and less relevant information, which influences the score towards the middle of the scale."
