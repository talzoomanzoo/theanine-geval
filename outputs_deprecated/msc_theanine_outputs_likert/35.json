Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A's cousin recently moved to Sweden, which has sparked Speaker A's interest in visiting the country. This desire to visit Sweden is leading Speaker A to consider saving money by taking on a second part-time job. Additionally, Speaker B, who is from Sweden, suggested checking out the volcanoes in the country for a unique experience.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides helpful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker A's cousin recently moved to Sweden, which aligns with Speaker A's comments about their cousin living in Sweden and helping with the trip planning. This connection is particularly helpful because it offers context for why Speaker A is interested in visiting Sweden and supports the conversation about trip planning. \n\nThe MEMORY also mentions Speaker A considering taking a second job to save money for the trip, adding depth to Speaker A's background and motivations, though this aspect does not directly relate to the current dialogue. Speaker B's suggestion about checking out volcanoes is relevant as well since Speaker A asked for must-sees in Sweden, though it's noted that Sweden is not known for volcanoes, which creates a minor inconsistency. \n\nOverall, the MEMORY has a naturally connected structure that aids the language model in understanding the past interactions and current context of Speaker A and Speaker B. A small deduction is given due to the minor inconsistency in suggesting volcanoes, leading to a score of 4 instead of 5."
