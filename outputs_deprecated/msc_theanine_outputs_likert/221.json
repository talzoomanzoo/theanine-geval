Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself!\nSpeaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food?\nSpeaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too?\nSpeaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A loves animals, especially white tigers, and works as a zookeeper. Speaker A has penguins at the zoo and enjoys working with animals, offering Speaker B a chance to help out. Speaker A mentions having dogs and Speaker B admires them for their peaceful nature. Speaker B asks Speaker A if they have had a pet raccoon before. Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid. Speaker A's pet raccoon enjoys eating pizza. Speaker A has a pet raccoon and has a friend who found baby raccoons.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Sid is pretty well-behaved when it comes to food, but he does love to explore and find new places to hide!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides several pieces of information that are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and could be helpful for a language model to generate a proper response. First, it introduces Journey, who is Speaker A's pet raccoon, which directly connects to the context where Journey eats a piece of pizza. Additionally, the MEMORY states that Journey enjoys eating pizza, further supporting the context conversation about Journey's eating habits. There is also information about Speaker A's other pet, Sid, the bearded dragon, which relates to Speaker B's question about Sid trying to get into food, further enhancing the conversation's context. \n\nAlthough the MEMORY contains information that may not be directly relevant to the specific dialogue context, such as Speaker A's love for white tigers, working as a zookeeper, and having penguins at the zoo, these are naturally phrased and can be easily identified by the language model as additional background information rather than directly beneficial for generating the next response in this specific context. Overall, MEMORY demonstrates a clear connection and development of events leading to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
