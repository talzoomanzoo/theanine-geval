Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself!\nSpeaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is interested in helping Speaker A with their penguins at the zoo and working with animals. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to have a house concert with their pets, sharing a love for music.\nSpeaker B inquires if Speaker A has experience with pet raccoons after Speaker A's pet raccoon, Journey, enjoys eating pizza. Speaker A expresses interest in having a pet raccoon after having a friend who found baby raccoons.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've tried to keep the food out of reach, but Journey always finds a way to sneak a bite!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a small amount of relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, primarily that Journey is associated with being a pet raccoon and enjoys eating pizza. However, the MEMORY does not offer much helpful information related to how to stop Journey from eating food, which would directly connect to Speaker B's question. Additionally, the details about Speaker B's interest in helping with penguins at the zoo, the plan for a house concert, and the general discussion of raccoons are not directly relevant to the current dialogue context. These additional memories are not structured or phrased in a way that aids in understanding the development of events leading to the current situation. Therefore, the MEMORY lacks clear and naturally connected information pertinent to respond to the dialogue context effectively, but it hints at some relevancy by linking Journey as a pet raccoon."
