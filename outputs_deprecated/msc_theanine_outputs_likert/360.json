Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week?\nSpeaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you?\nSpeaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions?\nSpeaker B: Unfortunately I mainly play games similar to RE. I don't know why I like them so much. I remember when I was little my brother play Doom and it gave me nightmares for a week. What genre of games you like?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World but mentions its lack of multiplayer and outdated graphics.\nSpeaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World.\nSpeaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I enjoy a mix of simulation and strategy games. Anything with a good story usually catches my interest.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information regarding Speaker A's preferences related to video games, specifically their enjoyment of \"Jurassic Park: World\" and hesitancy towards \"Resident Evil,\" which is consistent with Speaker A's mention of disliking scary games in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Speaker B's suggestion opportunity could be informed by knowing Speaker A enjoys different genres, as indicated by their enjoyment of Jurassic Park: World. However, the MEMORY could be more helpful if it included more details about the types of games Speaker A might enjoy or additional context about Speaker B's gaming preferences beyond Resident Evil-like games. Overall, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful but lacks in providing a wide array of contextual cues that can aid in generating a more tailored response in the current conversation."
