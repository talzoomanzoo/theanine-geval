Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has known how to swim since the age of 5 and offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\nSpeaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming. \nSpeaker B does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies, which causes Speaker A to plan a snorkeling trip and sign up for several trips. As a result, Speaker A is planning a snorkeling trip and wants to travel to the Caribbean for their next trip.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "No, I've never been to the Caribbean, but it sounds like a fantastic place to visit. I'm looking forward to learning how to swim and programming with your guidance.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information, such as Speaker A offering to teach Speaker B how to swim, which directly relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B hopes to learn to swim. The mention of Speaker A planning a snorkeling trip and wanting to travel to the Caribbean aligns with Speaker A's excitement about going to the Caribbean in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, some parts of the MEMORY could be misleading or not directly helpful. For example, the MEMORY suggests that Speaker B enjoys punk music for swimming and learning programming, but Speaker B only acknowledges the playlist in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT without specifying their music preferences. Details like Speaker A knowing how to swim since age 5 do not directly contribute to generating a more engaged response in the immediate DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, there is useful information, but the coherence and connection between MEMORY and DIALOGUE CONTEXT could be improved for a higher score."
