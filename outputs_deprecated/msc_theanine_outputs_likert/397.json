Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. \nSpeaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me.\nSpeaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house. \nSpeaker B: Understandable. Have you ever tried contacting animal control? That's how I got Bandicoot. I was working that day and animal control came by explaining about needing fosters for raccoons. I thought it was weird, so I did it and began to work at the small raccoon cafe that is part of the zoo. I love it. \nSpeaker A: That is a good idea.  Maybe they could help move them to a safer area.  I have a lot of traffic around and they could get hit if they are coming to my place all the time.  Have you been able to teach your raccoon any tricks?\nSpeaker B: The only trick I was able to teach him, that I deeply regret, was how locks worked. I thought it was cool at first, you know, to see a raccoon unlock a door. And now, I regret it so much. I've had to change the layout of my apartment and put deadbolts on my doors so that Bandicoot can't get out. And, he is sneaky about it. One time, he unlocked the pantry and was eating some cookies! It's like having a toddler that never grows up.\nSpeaker A: That is bad I guess.  Do you keep all of your chemicals, poisons, and medications up and locked?  I would hate to think what might happen if Bandicoot got into any of that.  Hey, when you drive do you lock him up in a cage or let him wander around in the car?  That could be dangerous for you driving and he freaks out.\nSpeaker B: All the chemicals and poisons are in a gated lock in the basement. The lock requires a specific key, which I have hidden in my drawers. For medication, I have a small box that I also keep locked up, but it's a combination lock, so Bandicoot isn't able to get into it. For driving, I bought a harness that keeps him strapped in the back seat, he can move a bit, but mostly sturdy. I put blankets down and his favorite toys so that he stays calm. Sometimes, I'll pass small snacks to keep him occupied. I also take the side streets to work so that it's not too much for him. What about you? When you foster dogs, do you put them in a cage when you drive?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys working as a zoo keeper, which causes Speaker A to be interested in animals, specifically raccoons and bearded dragons. Speaker B has been taking care of a raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it, while Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n\nSpeaker B working as a zoo keeper and enjoying it leads to Speaker B considering raccoons intelligent and funny. Speaker B wants raccoons to make good pets if cared for properly and believes in their potential. Speaker B's garbage has a lock to prevent animals from getting into it, especially during windy weather.\n\nSpeaker A fosters dogs till they find a forever home, similar to Speaker B working at a Raccoon Cafe and taking care of Bandicoot, a raccoon. This connection results in Speaker B owning a raccoon named Bandicoot and a bearded dragon named Bob.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "When I transport dogs, I always make sure they are safely secured in a crate in the back seat of my car. It's essential for their safety and mine while driving. Safety first, right?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant and helpful information for generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures key aspects of the conversation, such as Speaker A's issue with raccoons and Speaker B's experience with taking care of a raccoon named Bandicoot. These details align with the topics discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and potentially enrich the language model's understanding of the speakers' interactions.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY could be more specific and coherent. For example, it mentions Speaker B's belief in raccoons' potential as pets and owning a bearded dragon named Bob, which are not directly relevant to the ongoing dialogue about raccoon problems and safety concerns. Additionally, the MEMORY could build a stronger connection by focusing more on the backstory and causality of Speaker B's experiences with Bandicoot, which would be useful for generating responses that consider their shared interests and concerns around animals.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY is moderately helpful, containing some relevant points but lacking complete coherence and integration with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
