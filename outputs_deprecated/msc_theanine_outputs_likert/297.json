Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods.\nSpeaker B: Oh that sounds fun! What is it about?\nSpeaker A: Black Widow is one of the character in the Marvel Avengers movies. Like Thor and Captain America. Have you seen any of those movies?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys hot latina salsa and mentioned it while talking about Brazilian foods with their brother.\nSpeaker B prefers to keep holidays local with their brother instead of having big family gatherings, after expressing interest in trying healing methods mentioned by Speaker A.\nSpeaker A enjoys salsa dancing and is planning to go out dancing, which causes Speaker B to express interest in trying healing methods mentioned by Speaker A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does not give helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Although there are some mentions of Speaker A talking about Brazilian foods with their brother and Speaker B expressing interest in trying healing methods mentioned by Speaker A, these do not connect at all to the current discussion about the Black Widow movie and Marvel Avengers movies. There is no mention of movies, superheroes, or even related activities that are connected to the film or the context of the conversation. The sentences seem disjointed and do not give any indication of development or causality related to the ongoing dialogue, making it challenging for a language model to generate a pertinent next response."
