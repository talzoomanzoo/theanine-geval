Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue.\nSpeaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad.\nSpeaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs!\nSpeaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours?\nSpeaker A: Ikea! Their furniture is not to expensive and they have all kinds of furniture that'll go with whatever scheme you're going for. What kind of patio furniture were you looking for? Like a barbeque, chairs, hammock? \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is in the process of renovating their house to meet their living standards with their pets. This includes recently purchasing purple sofas for their home and considering adding more colorful elements to the room to make the purple sofas work. Speaker A is looking to redecorate their house and likes purple furniture, having recently bought new furniture for their house, including a couch, recliner, and patio furniture. They both enjoy barbecuing and have a love for pets, leading to them discussing furniture and home decor choices. This has caused Speaker A and Speaker B to plan to meet up to discuss the furniture exchange, with Speaker A offering devices to keep bugs away and sharing the product names with Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I was thinking of getting a nice outdoor dining set with some comfortable chairs. Thanks for the tip about Ikea, I'll check out their patio furniture selection.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful contextual information that can enhance the understanding of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT for generating a response. It highlights Speaker B's interest in renovating their house and considering the color scheme, which is relevant to the ongoing discussion about color schemes and furniture in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It also mentions the interest in barbecue, which is mentioned in the context as well. However, parts of the MEMORY like the specific mention of purple sofas and the detailed list of Speaker A's recent purchases are not directly relevant to the current conversation. While the MEMORY's structure is natural and informative, it mostly reiterates some known details rather than providing new insights into the speakers' interactions or future responses particular to the mosquito issue or specific furniture types being considered. Consequently, it is moderately helpful, providing some relevant but not fully integrated context."
