Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \nSpeaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with?\nSpeaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point.\nSpeaker A: Yes, it contains eggs.  I think you would do well with the fried rice. It's best to cook the rice the day before.  \nSpeaker B: I didn't know that. Why cook the rice beforehand? Is it better to age rice or something?\nSpeaker A: The rice needs to be cool before adding to the pan.  Are you able to take a passenger along in you truck?\nSpeaker B: Oh! That makes since. I didn't realize that the temperature made a difference when frying rice. As for the truck, Yes I can. But, depending on what company I'm working for at the time, they often set restrictions on passengers.\nSpeaker A: The rice tends to stick together if it's warm.  I would like to ride along with you sometime when you're able.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, who does not cook but enjoys listening to country music and drives trucks for a living, has a husband who is a great cook. Speaker B is not skilled in cooking, but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker. \nSpeaker B, who does not cook but enjoys listening to country music and drives trucks for a living, also mentions having a farm with animals like chickens, ducks, pigs, goats, and growing crops like corn, strawberries, and pumpkins. Speaker A, who owns a farm and enjoys cooking and baking, is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken. \nSpeaker B, who lives in a rural area with a farm and can relate to cooking, reacts to Speaker A who bakes muffins and bread but is conscious of their impact on their weight. Speaker A is interested in running a business with their cooking skills and recommends the pressure cooker for its efficiency and ease of use, suggesting it to Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That would be great! I'll let you know when I have a passenger seat available.",
    "prediction": "To evaluate the helpfulness of the MEMORY, we need to assess how well it provides useful context for generating a suitable response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\nThe DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves a conversation about cooking, particularly with a pressure cooker, and includes suggestions for recipes like shrimp fried rice. Speaker B is interested in learning about cooking and has mentioned their own eggs, which led to discussing the importance of rice preparation in frying. The conversation also touches briefly on Speaker B’s truck driving and passenger policies.\n\nNow, let's break down the MEMORY:\n\n1. Speaker B's non-cooking background and interest in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker are relevant, as it aligns with their eagerness to try new recipes and understand cooking techniques in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n2. Mention of farming and animals connects to Speaker B's comment about growing their own eggs, making it somewhat relevant.\n3. Speaker B’s occupation as a truck driver is tangentially related due to their discussion on truck passenger policies.\n4. Speaker A’s cooking interest aligns with the context as they are suggesting recipes and cooking techniques to Speaker B.\n5. However, much of the MEMORY content—like enjoying country music, having a husband who is a great cook, conscious eating habits, business aspirations, specific recipe interests (e.g., dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken), and muffin baking—is not immediately relevant to the direct content of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe MEMORY contains some useful information for context, but much is either redundant or less pertinent to the immediate content of the dialogue. While the details offer a broader view of the speakers' profiles, less than half directly influences or enhances the given dialogue.\n\nHelpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful context, particularly regarding Speaker B's interest in learning to cook with a pressure cooker and references to farming, which relates to growing their own eggs. However, there's a significant amount of detail that does not directly contribute to understanding the current conversation between the speakers in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
