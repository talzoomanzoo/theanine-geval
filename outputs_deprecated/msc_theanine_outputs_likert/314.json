Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you.\nSpeaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them\nSpeaker A: IN MY HOME?! A TREE? That was not at all what I was thinking. Do they grow well indoors? I am intrigued. \nSpeaker B: Well if you want to make it like a proper garden experience then I would suggest going all in, and go for the best most authentic looking items you could get \nSpeaker A: Wow! Ok! This is sounding like a bigger undertaking! Should I embrace bugs in the home if they help the plants or am I getting wild?\nSpeaker B: Well from my experince bugs do the complete opposite and don't help at all, so avoid that at all costs! Fertilizers are the way to go to help with growth.\nSpeaker A: Oh man. I have lots to learn. What is the lifespan of a plum tree?\nSpeaker B: around 10 to 15 years but if you take care of them I'm sure you could get 20 out of it.\nSpeaker A: Now we are also talking commitment! This is not how I expected my day to go! I am excited, yet so nervous! \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A's parents are teachers. Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden. Speaker B mentions the Chinese advancements in thermal nuclear generators and the need for a Manhattan Project for alternative energy. Speaker B is also interested in space exploration and plant science, expressing concerns about the fuels used for space travel.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information about Speaker B's knowledge in gardening and plants, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about making a garden and discussing plant types. This information could be helpful for the language model to understand Speaker B's expertise. However, other parts of the MEMORY, such as the mention of the Chinese advancements in thermal nuclear generators, space exploration, and plant science regarding space travel fuels, are not directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. These details are not phrased in a way that easily indicates their lack of relevance to the conversation. Additionally, Speaker A's parents being teachers is not relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORYâ€™s connections and developments are not well-structured to provide significant help to the language model, thus resulting in a score of 2."
