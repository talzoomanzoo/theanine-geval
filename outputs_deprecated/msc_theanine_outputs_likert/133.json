Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed with such a big decision. Teaching can be a rewarding path, especially with your passion for linguistics. Just remember, it's okay to explore different options before committing.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information for generating a next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes details about Speaker B's academic and career ambitions, which are directly related to the current topic of conversation about career options and the prospect of teaching. It also mentions Speaker B's consideration of a master's degree and a potential career as a college professor, which aligns with the dialogue's focus on teaching as a career choice. Furthermore, the MEMORY highlights Speaker B's uncertainty about job opportunities, connecting to the stress mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The information about Speaker A's interest in teaching computer science adds depth to the understanding of their perspective, though it is less directly relevant to the immediate conversation. Overall, the MEMORY is structured in a way that conveys relevant past interactions and aspirations, assisting in generating a coherent next response."
