Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\nSpeaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call!\nSpeaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip? \nSpeaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery\nSpeaker B: Yes I think that's a great idea, how is work at the library? \nSpeaker A: Busy, and demanding because we are short staffed. While there seems to be little need for a library these days, I find that we have less staff to get everything done\nSpeaker B: Well if you ever need someone to come and help for a couple of hours here and there, give me a call, you know how much I love to be in the library anyway\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is a librarian and loves kids, mentioning having 3 children. Speaker B's mother was a librarian, which seems to have influenced their perspective on the job. Speaker A is a retired librarian who enjoys implementing creative activities in their library. \n\nSpeaker B's kids do not go to work by boat like Speaker A. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids. \n\nSpeaker B has a lot of kids, all grown up now and with kids of their own. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you, that's very kind of you to offer. I might take you up on that sometime, it would be nice to have the extra help.",
    "prediction": "3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically towards Speaker B's interest in family-related activities (e.g., spending time with grandkids and enjoying fishing trips) and Speaker A's busy work schedule at the library. However, there are sentences in the MEMORY that are either repeated or do not provide additional context to the conversation at hand. Additionally, there are discrepancies regarding Speaker A's occupation; MEMORY mentions both that Speaker A is a librarian and a retired librarian. While the dialogue context indicates Speaker A currently works at the library, such inconsistencies might confuse a language model generating a follow-up response. Furthermore, details about Speaker B's past interactions (such as their mother being a librarian) are less relevant to the current conversation. Overall, the MEMORY captures some relevant context and interaction history but could be improved for clearer development and more precise contributions to the ongoing conversation."
