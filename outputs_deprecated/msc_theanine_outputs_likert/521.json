    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer?\nSpeaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to?\nSpeaker A: The museum has all sorts of galleries.  It has a sculpture garden outside.  I mostly like the impressionist paintings.  I like Van Gogh.  Was your concert outdoors?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys living in the city for the accessibility to food, live music, and museums. They are planning a trip to Sao Paulo and will visit the Museum of Art of São Paulo with their boyfriend next week. \nSpeaker B enjoys living in the city for the accessibility to food, live music, and drove over 1000 miles to see their favorite band, Three Dog Night.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant background information about both speakers' interests, which could be useful for generating responses related to music, museums, and city life. However, the information is not directly connected to the specific DIALOGUE CONTEXT about a concert on the fourth of July or art museums featuring impressionist paintings. The MEMORY contains a sentence about Speaker B's interest in live music which is applicable to the conversation, but it lacks detailed past interactions or development that would more naturally aid in generating a next response. Additionally, the details about the trip to São Paulo and the Museum of Art are not currently relevant to the immediate dialogue context. Overall, while there are bits of relevant information, they are not as naturally structured or directly helpful for the current conversation as they could be."
