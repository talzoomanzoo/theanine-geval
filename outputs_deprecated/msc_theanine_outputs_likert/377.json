Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens?\nSpeaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month\nSpeaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.  Where are you going on vacation?\nSpeaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there!\nSpeaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo?\nSpeaker B: Their zoo is pretty good! It's always crowded, of course, but they have pandas so I'm happy. I would say it's bigger than the DC zoo, but I like that the DC zoo has fewer people.\nSpeaker A: That sounds awesome.  I haven't been to the zoo in so long.  I wish I could go.\nSpeaker B: You should go with your sister! she can bring her dog. They probably have all kinds of exotic birds...\nSpeaker A: That's a great idea!  I'm not sure how good her dog would do around other animals though.  She always barks like crazy whenever she sees any kind of animal.\nSpeaker B: Oh, that's a good point. Maybe keep her away from the small rodent house and reptiles, eh?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys gardening and reading, while Speaker B enjoys visiting the zoo, especially to see pandas and penguins. Speaker A decides to go to the zoo with their sister, who is a dog person with a yellow lab. Speaker B's girlfriend, who loves pandas and penguins, has a noisy cockatoo and they visit the zoo regularly. Speaker B is open to being a cool uncle to his sister's future children but does not want kids of his own.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, that's probably a good idea. I'll suggest that to her. Thanks for the tip!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: MEMORY contains some relevant information about Speaker B's enjoyment of visiting the zoo and their interest in pandas, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B mentions going to San Diego and being happy about seeing pandas at the zoo. However, much of the MEMORY includes irrelevant details that do not directly contribute to generating a response in the current conversation, such as Speaker A's interest in gardening and Speaker B's girlfriend having a cockatoo. These pieces of information do not naturally connect with the dialogue context and do not help develop the conversation about the zoo or vacation plans. Additionally, information about Speaker B's future intention regarding potential children is unrelated to the context. Therefore, while some parts are loosely connected, the overall helpfulness of MEMORY is rather limited."
