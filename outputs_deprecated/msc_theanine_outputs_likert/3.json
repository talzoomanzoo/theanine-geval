Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break, which is why Speaker B dyed their hair with henna and enjoys experimenting with different hair colors. Speaker A, a retired librarian, used to have quiet spring breaks, but now recommends the book \"Beautiful Ruins\" by Jess Walter for a beach visit.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking. I recently finished reading \"Where the Crawdads Sing\" by Delia Owens, and I highly recommend it. How about you, any new books on your reading list?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some contextual information about Speaker A and Speaker B, which might be helpful in understanding their interests and personalities. For instance, knowing that Speaker B enjoys experimenting with hair colors might suggest a creative and adventurous personality, which aligns with their excitement about traveling to Costa Rica. Similarly, knowing that Speaker A is a retired librarian could suggest that they enjoy reading, which is consistent with recommending a book in the MEMORY. \n\nHowever, most of the MEMORY does not relate directly to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The topics of Easter weekend, spring break, and hair dye do not connect to the current conversation about travel or books. The MEMORY also does not provide much past interaction context that would help in generating a next response relevant to Speaker B's trip to Costa Rica or Speaker A's book reading habits. Therefore, while the MEMORY is somewhat helpful in providing insight into the speakers' personalities, it lacks relevance to the immediate dialogue context, resulting in a lower score."
