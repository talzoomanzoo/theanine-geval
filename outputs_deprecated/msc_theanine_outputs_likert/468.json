Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it?\nSpeaker B: Yes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see. \nSpeaker A: I definitely will, this sounds like such an amazing trip. How long has it been since you've been there yourself?\nSpeaker B: I was in Greece last two years ago.   I am excited to go again soon!    At somepoint I would like to take a cruise around the islands there.  It seems like a neat way to see all the Islands in an easy way.   Have you ever taken a cruise?\nSpeaker A: Only once before when I was very young, so I don't remember much. It sounds like such a relaxing way to enjoy the day, though. Maybe we can plan a cruise together sometime.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A's favorite cities from the trip were Rome, Berlin, Madrid, and Helsinki. This sounds like such an amazing trip. \nSpeaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five. Speaker B and their kids are excited about their upcoming trip to Greece.\nSpeaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian. Speaker B is planning to leave for a trip later in the summer, likely a month before school starts.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That would be fantastic! I'll have to look into planning a cruise around the Greek islands for our next adventure.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that could help in generating a proper next response. For instance, the fact that Speaker B is planning a trip to Greece with a family of five and is excited about their upcoming trip is relevant to the dialogue as it connects to the discussion about Greece and visiting the Acropolis. Speaker B's excitement about Greece and their admiration for Athena is also somewhat related, as it ties into their enthusiasm for the trip. However, certain parts of the MEMORY, like the list of Speaker A's favorite cities, do not directly connect to the current dialogue context, reducing the overall helpfulness. Additionally, some sentences could be more cohesively structured to improve clarity and contextual understanding, leading to a middle score."
