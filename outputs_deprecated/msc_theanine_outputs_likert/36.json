Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country, while Speaker B is from Sweden and mentioned playing tennis and going to church on Sunday. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip, causing Speaker B to recommend checking out the volcanoes in Sweden for a unique experience.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "Visby sounds lovely, I'll definitely add it to my list of places to visit in Sweden!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A having a cousin in Sweden, which is consistent with Speaker A's statement about receiving help from her cousin in planning the trip. However, there are inaccuracies and disconnected information in the MEMORY that affect its helpfulness. For example, the volcanoes in Sweden are suggested by Speaker B as a unique experience, but there are no such volcanoes, leading to confusion. While the MEMORY mentions Speaker B being from Sweden, which aligns with their recommendation of spots to visit, it does not contribute to providing helpful cues directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about castles and personal favorite spots such as Visby. Overall, MEMORY contains some helpful elements but lacks proper connection and development, affecting its effectiveness."
