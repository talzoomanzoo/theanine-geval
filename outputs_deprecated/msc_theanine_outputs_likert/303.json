Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods.\nSpeaker B: Oh that sounds fun! What is it about?\nSpeaker A: Black Widow is one of the character in the Marvel Avengers movies. Like Thor and Captain America. Have you seen any of those movies?\nSpeaker B: No I haven't seen any of those. What foods did you eat while watching the movie?\nSpeaker A: Wow, there are so many of the movies out there. Don't go see Black Widow without watching Avengers first. I had an amazing steak and vegetables on the side that were delicious. What is you favorite food? \nSpeaker B: Oh ok I definitely will watch those first! I love both steak and vegetables! I am a real foodie and love just about everything that isn't too strange to try lol.\nSpeaker A: Oh wow! Do you like sushi? I love it but the sea urchin is a little crazy lol. Have you ever eaten sea urchin?\nSpeaker B: I have never tried sea urchin or sushi but I do like crab legs and shrimp! Do you ever consider any foods to be good for healing? I find that you do healing very fascinating!\nSpeaker A: Yes, in fact I consider almost all foods to either be healing, harmful or neutral. In my opinion people should choose foods based on how they want to feel. Sushi is fresh and healthy so I considerate it to be very healing.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B expressed interest in trying healing methods mentioned by Speaker A. Speaker A finds being on the water therapeutic and relaxing. Speaker B goes sailing during the summer for the best \"scenery.\"\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I agree, choosing foods based on how you want to feel is important. I'll have to try sushi sometime for that fresh and healthy feeling!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains information that is somewhat related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as it mentions that Speaker B expressed interest in trying healing methods, which connects to the discussion about healing foods in the context. However, the rest of the details in the MEMORY (such as sailing and being on the water) are not relevant to the current context of the conversation about movies and food, and there is no strong connection or development of past interactions based on the context provided. The MEMORY contains some meaningful elements, but overall it does not provide enough helpful or closely connected information to aid in generating the next response."
