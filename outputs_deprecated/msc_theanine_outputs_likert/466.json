Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it?\nSpeaker B: Yes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see. \nSpeaker A: I definitely will, this sounds like such an amazing trip. How long has it been since you've been there yourself?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A's mother being a pediatrician causes Speaker A to have kids and be familiar with Greek mythology, which in turn causes Speaker B to plan a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five. \nSpeaker B having three kids makes Speaker A have kids and be familiar with Greek mythology, leading Speaker B and their kids to be excited about their upcoming trip to Greece. \nSpeaker B being excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loving Athena, whom they consider a perfect goddess for a librarian, is the same topic as Speaker B's enjoyment of being outside and reading Star Wars novels, which in turn makes Speaker B plan a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nThe MEMORY provided is not helpful in generating a proper next response for Speaker B based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences in MEMORY are overly complex and convoluted, presenting connections and causality that do not align clearly with the conversation at hand. The MEMORY mentions multiple unrelated details such as Speaker A's familiarity with Greek mythology, Speaker B's plans for a trip, and their enjoyment of being outside and reading Star Wars novels, none of which are clearly linked to the current conversation about the Acropolis and Athens trip beyond the overarching theme of Greece.\n\nThe MEMORY attempts to create a narrative around personal and family details that are not directly related to the present dialogue. This could confuse the language model, as the MEMORY does not provide clear or direct contextual cues relevant to the current topic of dialogue. It fails to offer helpful insights or background that would assist Speaker B in naturally continuing the conversation about Speaker A's planned visit to the Acropolis and their excitement about the trip. Thus, it does not facilitate the development of the exchange or enrich the context for generating a coherent and relevant response."
