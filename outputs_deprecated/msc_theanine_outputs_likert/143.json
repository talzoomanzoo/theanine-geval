Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities, suggesting taking the pets to the zoo and mentioning that most major cities have good zoos, particularly to see the tiger named Joshua. \nSpeaker B used to have pets but they are now with their wife, and has a young daughter who is 8 years old and becoming independent, considering calling in sick to work to go to the zoo with their child, who wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information about Speaker B's daughter and her interest in visiting the zoo, which is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A inquires about the trip and whether the daughter liked the place (presumably a zoo trip). However, while the MEMORY offers context on past interactions, such as Speaker A's enjoyment of zoos and the fact that Speaker B's daughter is interested in visiting the zoo, it doesn't directly answer the question about how the trip went or if the daughter liked it. The information about Speaker B's past with pets and details about their daughter's independence or the push for a school field trip, although informative, isn't directly relevant to the context of the trip. Thus, it only partially aids in crafting an appropriate response to the given context."
