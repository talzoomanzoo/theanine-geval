Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing?\nSpeaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from?\nSpeaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there.\nSpeaker B: That's great. I have gotten my pets from the shelter and they seem happy I brought them home. I have a hard time saying no to them which is why I have so many pets. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs. Do you have a name in mind for your cat? \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A's brother might commission a family portrait from Speaker B, who has 5 dogs of different breeds and rats as pets but didn't include them in the portrait. Speaker B's prices for a portrait start at $5000 to pay for college tuition, and they are in college, paint on the side, and have five dogs and three rats. Speaker B thinks pit bulls are lovely and has one that is kind and sweet, and likes Persian cats, imagining their pets having interesting interactions. Speaker A is considering getting kittens and thinks rats can be smart. Speaker B is busy with school and taking care of their five dogs, so working at a doggy daycare would be too much, as they are working on other portraits and taking care of a sick dog.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about the relationship between Speaker A and Speaker B, such as the possibility of a family portrait commission, Speaker B's pricing, and their busy schedule with college and pets. While this information isn't directly necessary for generating a proper next response in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, it does provide background on Speaker B's painting work and pet situation, which are relevant topics in the dialogue. However, many details, such as Speaker B's specific pricing and college pursuits, do not directly contribute to the conversation about pets and portraits. The MEMORY is somewhat helpful as it contains relevant background, but the connection between this information and the specific dialogue at hand is not particularly strong or necessary, hence a middle score of 3."
