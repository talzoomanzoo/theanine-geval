Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself!\nSpeaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food?\nSpeaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too?\nSpeaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also?\nSpeaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways?\nSpeaker B: They've been better as I left my previous job so I'm spending more time with them, how do you manage to work full time and still keep those animals happy?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A works as a zookeeper and loves animals, especially white tigers. Speaker A works at a zoo and has tried playing music for the white tigers and home concerts for their pets. Speaker B is looking for a new job and is excited about the opportunity at the zoo. Speaker B has elderly terriers and is planning to leave their part-time job for a break before starting a new one. \n\nSpeaker B has two terrier dogs as pets. Speaker A has penguins at the zoo and enjoys working with animals, offering Speaker B a chance to help out. Speaker A mentions having dogs and Speaker B admires them for their peaceful nature. Speaker B asks Speaker A if they have had a pet raccoon before. \n\nSpeaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid. Speaker A has a pet raccoon and has a friend who found baby raccoons.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several helpful pieces of information that are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid, which aligns with the discussion in the dialogue about Journey eating a piece of pizza and Sid's behavior. Additionally, the MEMORY contains details about Speaker A and B's professional lives and interests, which adds depth to their characterization and could inform future interactions or responses. However, not all information in the MEMORY is directly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as details about Speaker A's work with penguins or music for white tigers, and Speaker B’s job search and admiration for Speaker A’s dogs. These elements, while interesting, do not directly influence the flow of the current conversation. Overall, the MEMORY contributes useful background for Speaker A's response, but the connection could be slightly more focused on the current dialogue topic."
