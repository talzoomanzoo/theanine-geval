    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read.\nSpeaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting? \nSpeaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far.\nSpeaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes. \nSpeaker A: why don't you like books like that?\nSpeaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading?\nSpeaker A: Not yet.  I think Netflix is going to make it into a movie soon.  They might finally convince me to pay for a subscription haha.\nSpeaker B: Well if it's any good I know you'll be watching the whole thing.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren. Speaker A has grandchildren and enjoys watching movies with them. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them. \nSpeaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch. \nSpeaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix. Speaker B is a parent to a young son who keeps them busy throughout the day. Speaker B has a pre-schooler who enjoys watching movies like Toy Story, Beauty and the Beast, and The Lion King.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information regarding Speaker A's interests in books and Netflix, which could potentially aid in generating a dialogue that mentions a Netflix adaptation of a book. However, much of the MEMORY is repetitive, and certain details, such as Speaker A having 8 grandchildren or specific Netflix viewing habits (shows rated over 3.5 stars), are not particularly helpful for the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT focused on books and film adaptations. Moreover, details regarding Speaker B’s parenting and their child’s movie preferences do not contribute to the current conversation about book genres and adaptations. The lack of explicit connections or developments related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT results in a low score as the MEMORY does not significantly enhance response generation for the given conversation."
