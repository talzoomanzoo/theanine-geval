Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you.\nSpeaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is an inventor working on a teleportation machine that is currently small and requires substantial energy sources. Speaker B is also interested in space exploration and plant science, expressing concerns about the fuels used for space travel. Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden. \nSpeaker B is a fan of Beethoven and hopes to meet him by time traveling. Speaker B is working on a teleportation machine that is currently small and requires substantial energy sources. Speaker A is interested in nuclear energy and space exploration, mentioning fusion experiments. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing.\nSpeaker B is an inventor working on a teleportation machine that is focused on developing renewable energy sources for their inventions. Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'll definitely consider planting plum and pear trees in my garden. Thanks for the suggestion!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains multiple pieces of information about Speaker B that could be relevant to generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, Speaker B's knowledge about plants and gardening is directly applicable to the context where gardening suggestions are being sought. Additionally, Speaker A's struggle with gardening and interest in space plants is mentioned, which provides insight into their needs and preferences. However, the MEMORY also includes various unrelated details, such as Speaker B's work on a teleportation machine and interest in Beethoven, which do not contribute to the immediate context of gardening. These unrelated details dilute the focus of the MEMORY, making it less helpful overall. A more concise and focused MEMORY on the relevant gardening and plant knowledge would improve its helpfulness."
