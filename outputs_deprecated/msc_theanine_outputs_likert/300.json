    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods.\nSpeaker B: Oh that sounds fun! What is it about?\nSpeaker A: Black Widow is one of the character in the Marvel Avengers movies. Like Thor and Captain America. Have you seen any of those movies?\nSpeaker B: No I haven't seen any of those. What foods did you eat while watching the movie?\nSpeaker A: Wow, there are so many of the movies out there. Don't go see Black Widow without watching Avengers first. I had an amazing steak and vegetables on the side that were delicious. What is you favorite food? \nSpeaker B: Oh ok I definitely will watch those first! I love both steak and vegetables! I am a real foodie and love just about everything that isn't too strange to try lol.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys taking their houseboat out and works as a bartender. Speaker A and their brother enjoy going to a Brazilian steakhouse for dinner. Speaker B prefers to keep holidays local with their brother instead of having big family gatherings. Speaker A plans to grab dinner with their brother before dancing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information about Speaker A and Speaker B that is related to personal preferences and activities, such as dining out, working as a bartender, and holiday preferences. However, it doesn't directly address the specific topics discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the movie 'Black Widow,' Marvel movies, or food preferences during movie outings. The MEMORY does not provide a clear connection or causality that would help the language model generate a response directly relevant to the current conversation. The information in the MEMORY could be useful for developing a broader understanding of the speakers' interests in different contexts, but it is not structured in a way that is immediately helpful for the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
