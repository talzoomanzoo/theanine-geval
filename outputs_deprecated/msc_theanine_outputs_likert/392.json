    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. \nSpeaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me.\nSpeaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A fosters dogs till they find a forever home. Speaker B works at a Raccoon Cafe and takes care of Bandicoot, a raccoon. Speaker B wants to train the raccoon and has been taking care of it for over a month. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n\nSpeaker A works in software solutions for tech companies and finds it less exciting than being a zoo keeper. Speaker A admires raccoons but has not interacted closely with them. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly. Speaker B's garbage has a lock to prevent animals from getting into it, especially during windy weather.\n\nSpeaker A works in software solutions for tech companies and finds it less exciting than being a zoo keeper. Speaker B works at a Raccoon Cafe and takes care of Bandicoot, a raccoon. Speaker B owns a raccoon named Bandicoot and a bearded dragon named Bob.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "I completely understand your concern. It's important to keep a safe distance from wild animals, especially if they could potentially cause harm or carry diseases.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several relevant details that can assist Speaker B in generating a response. It mentions Speaker A's raccoon problem and plan to use aluminum sheeting, which directly links to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, it outlines Speaker B's work at a Raccoon Cafe and their experience with raccoons, particularly Bandicoot, which ties back to the ongoing discussion about raccoons. These connections and details are helpful for maintaining the conversation's flow and relevance. The MEMORY is well-structured and provides coherence about past interactions, aiding in the response generation process. However, the repetition of some information, such as Speaker A's job in software solutions and Speaker B owning Bandicoot, could be refined for better clarity, preventing it from reaching a score of 5."
