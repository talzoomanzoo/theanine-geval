Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\nSpeaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach?\nSpeaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B wants to turn their linguistics major into a practical job, while Speaker A wants to develop apps for differently abled youth through studying computer science. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics. \nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science, while Speaker B is considering further education to become a college professor in linguistics, feeling limited in job opportunities.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Teaching English or history could be a great fit for you. It's always good to have options to explore!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures Speaker B's desire to turn their linguistics major into a practical job, which aligns with their interest in teaching English, as discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It also mentions Speaker A's interest in teaching computer science, particularly in robotics, which directly relates to their conversation about Speaker A's hope to teach robotics someday. Furthermore, the memory includes details about Speaker A working at a pizza shop to pay for college and Speaker B considering further education, which although not directly related to the immediate conversational thread, provide a deeper understanding of the backgrounds and considerations of both speakers. These details are naturally structured and represent the development of the conversation in a way that can aid the language model in generating informed responses. However, there are some parts like Speaker A developing apps for differently-abled youth, which are not directly relevant to the immediate context, but are still useful for a broader understanding. Hence, it receives a score of 4."
