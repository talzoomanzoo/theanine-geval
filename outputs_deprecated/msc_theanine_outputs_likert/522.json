Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer?\nSpeaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to?\nSpeaker A: The museum has all sorts of galleries.  It has a sculpture garden outside.  I mostly like the impressionist paintings.  I like Van Gogh.  Was your concert outdoors?\nSpeaker B: Yes. That way they could have a fireworks show too. I love fireworks. Have you ever seen the fireworks at the Disney castle?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B drove over 1000 miles to see their favorite band, Three Dog Night. Speaker B enjoys living in the city for the accessibility to food and live music. Speaker A enjoys going to museums and trying different foods. Speaker A and their boyfriend also look forward to having some refreshing beers by the beach.\n\nSpeaker B drove over 1000 miles to see their favorite band, Three Dog Night. Speaker B enjoys living in the city for the accessibility to food and live music. Speaker A is interested in music concerts and planning a trip to Sao Paulo.

    "raw_prediction": "No, I haven't seen the fireworks at the Disney castle, but it sounds magical. I hope to experience it someday.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides scattered and somewhat relevant information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it lacks a coherent structure that connects the past interactions of Speaker A and Speaker B, making it difficult to generate a proper next response. The MEMORY contains details about Speaker B's musical interests and trips, but it does not directly address the concerts or museums mentioned in the context. Additionally, there are repetitions and discrepancies in Speaker A's interests and plans, which can create confusion. While there is some mention of a museum and music, it doesn’t clearly relate to the concert and museum conversation happening in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, the MEMORY does not sufficiently provide useful contextual cues for generating a relevant response."
