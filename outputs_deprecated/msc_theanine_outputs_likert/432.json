Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\nSpeaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout. \nSpeaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat. \nSpeaker B is considering attending a local community college for the first couple of years.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great way for kids to learn important life skills while having fun outdoors. I'll look into signing them up for Boy Scouts.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides useful background information that relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It details Speaker B's extensive experience with Boy Scouts, which connects directly with the discussion about survival skills and camping in the dialogue. This information helps the language model understand why Speaker B is knowledgeable about the topic. The mention of Speaker A appreciating Speaker B's involvement in the scout troop aligns with Speaker B's suggestion to involve Speaker A's kids, adding a layer of credibility to Speaker B's advice. The MEMORY is structured in a way that naturally highlights Speaker B's qualifications. However, the part about Speaker B considering attending a local community college is not relevant to the current context. Despite this, the overall helpfulness of the MEMORY in guiding a response related to the conversation earns it a score of 4."
