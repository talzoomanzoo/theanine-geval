Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B mentions living in a rural area with a farm and being able to relate to cooking. Speaker A also talks about primarily cooking Indian food and baking rice dishes. Additionally, Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work. \n\nSpeaker A enjoys cooking and baking, and is considering turning it into a business. Speaker B mentions having a farm with animals like chickens, ducks, pigs, and goats, as well as growing crops like corn, strawberries, and pumpkins. This resonates with Speaker A, who owns a farm and also enjoys cooking and baking. This has led Speaker A to become a cook who uses a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n\nSpeaker B's rural lifestyle and farming background have sparked Speaker A's interest in running a business with their cooking skills. Speaker B, who is not a cook, is intrigued and wants to learn more about cooking with a pressure cooker.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

It includes relevant details about Speaker B's husband who enjoys cooking Asian food with lots of prep work, directly linking to Speaker A's offer of beginner recipes and suggestion for Asian food. Additionally, information about both speakers' connections to cooking, farming, and potential business interests provides helpful context. The sentences are naturally structured, demonstrating connections between the speakers' past interactions and resonances. However, some parts of MEMORY, like farm details, are less directly linked to the immediate context, which prevents a perfect score. Overall, the MEMORY is useful but has room for slight improvements in relevance and focus."
