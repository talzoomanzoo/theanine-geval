Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \nSpeaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!).\nSpeaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol\nSpeaker B: I am up for the challenge! I have a few tricks up my sleeve to deal with people like you.\nSpeaker A: Oh geez that makes me sound difficult.lol  Do you have any new speeches coming up?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, originally from San Francisco, enjoys fishing and the outdoors, and has experience running a marathon which they found tough but rewarding. Speaker A, on the other hand, is from Venice Beach, is a dedicated runner working on improving their mile time and training for a marathon. Speaker B, known as a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks, joked about combining fishing with feeling depressed. Additionally, Speaker B's job involves motivating people to be successful and follow their dreams, which was inspired by their past marathon experience.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information that directly relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It offers a clear and naturally structured background on Speaker B's motivational speaking role, which directly ties into the conversation about delivering speeches and motivating others to run. Moreover, the MEMORY elaborates on Speaker B's experience running a marathon, which complements their ability to motivate and inspire others, a topic of discussion in the dialogue. The MEMORY also makes a connection by mentioning Speaker A's interest in running, which aligns with the content of the conversation. The information is presented clearly and demonstrates a relevant development of the two speakers' past interactions. Therefore, the MEMORY effectively aids in generating a proper next response for Speaker B."
