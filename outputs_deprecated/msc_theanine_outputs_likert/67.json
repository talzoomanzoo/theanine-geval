Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play? \nSpeaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is in a band where they play the drums and write music, with 4 members including the singer who is their best friend. This suggests Speaker A is in a band and plays music, possibly a musician. Additionally, Speaker A's band visited Italy, Uzbekistan, and smaller countries in Central and South America.\n\nSpeaker A grew up in California on the beach and loves morning surfing, which indicates that they enjoy surfing and music as a way to escape from daily life. As a result, Speaker A is good at surfing, nicknamed \"lil fishie\", and enjoys eating fish, particularly salmon or tuna. \n\nSpeaker B is a passionate cook who enjoys making Italian dishes like pasta, risotto, and pizza.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's cool! Rock music is always a good choice. Do you have a favorite band or song?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful context about Speaker A that can be considered helpful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it reveals that Speaker A is a musician, plays the drums, and is in a band, which directly relates to Speaker B's lack of instrument skills as previously discussed in the dialogue. Additionally, it suggests possible topics for Speaker A to discuss, such as their music, band experiences, or travels, which could naturally follow the conversation. \n\nHowever, the MEMORY also contains details that are less relevant to the immediate context, such as Speaker A's surfing habits and dietary preferences, or Speaker B's cooking interests, which do not directly contribute to the continuation of the conversation about music and instruments. These details are well-phrased but not directly connected to the current dialogue context, which limits the MEMORY's helpfulness. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate as it includes some relevant information and is well structured but also contains less related information."
