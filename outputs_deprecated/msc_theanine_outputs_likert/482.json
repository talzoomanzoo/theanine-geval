    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \nSpeaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!).\nSpeaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol\nSpeaker B: I am up for the challenge! I have a few tricks up my sleeve to deal with people like you.\nSpeaker A: Oh geez that makes me sound difficult.lol  Do you have any new speeches coming up?\nSpeaker B: Nope, I just cleared my schedule until the Alps marathon that you're training for. It's just you and me until you break that finish line. I'm going to start sending you a motivational quote every morning at 4 am when I want you to wake up.\nSpeaker A: Wow 4 am.  Is it too late to change my mind?lol\nSpeaker B: Yes. We have an iron-clad written agreement. Tell me how I'm doing so far. Is this the most motivated you've ever been in your entire life?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, who travels frequently for work and misses their wife and kids, has previous experience running a marathon and found it tough but rewarding. Speaker A, originally from Venice Beach, is a dedicated runner working on improving their mile time and training for a marathon. Speaker B, a motivational speaker from San Francisco who enjoys fishing and the outdoors, has a job that involves motivating people to be successful and follow their dreams. Additionally, Speaker A and Speaker B have joked about combining fishing with feeling depressed and taking young boys to the pond during school hours.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Definitely up there in the top three most motivated moments of my life! Let's get after it!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant background information that could be helpful in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes Speaker B as a motivational speaker and mentions their experience with marathons, which aligns with the ongoing dialogue about motivation and marathon training. However, not all details in the MEMORY are directly linked to the current context of discussing motivational strategies and upcoming events. The mention of fishing and taking young boys to the pond is not clearly connected to the dialogue and could be confusing rather than helpful. Overall, while some information is relevant, the MEMORY could be more cohesive and focused on the context to be more helpful."
