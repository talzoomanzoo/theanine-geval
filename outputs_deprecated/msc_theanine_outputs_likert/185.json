Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally. This is similar to how Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe. Speaker B's grandmother was the matriarch of the family, known for cooking large meals for family gatherings. \nSpeaker A, who is part of a music band and plays the drums, loves making food for others just like how Speaker B enjoys snowboarding, surfing, and skateboarding.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for Speaker B to generate a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes a connection between Speaker A and Speaker B through their mutual enjoyment of cooking, and highlights a specific and relevant detail about Speaker B's grandmother's garlic chicken recipe. This detail is particularly pertinent to the context since Speaker A inquires about the garlic chicken. \n\nHowever, while the MEMORY clarifies Speaker B's sentimental connection to the garlic chicken recipe, it could be better structured to create a more robust and coherent narrative connection with the spicy food aspect mentioned by Speaker A. Additionally, other details about Speaker A's drumming and both speakers' hobbies (snowboarding, surfing, and skateboarding) are not relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, though they are naturally phrased and do not detract from the MEMORY's overall coherence."
