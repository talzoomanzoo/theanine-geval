Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science, and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics. \nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities. \nSpeaker B majoring in linguistics causes Speaker A to be interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you! I'm lucky to have supportive parents. How about you, do your parents support your decision to pursue teaching?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that can help the language model generate a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains details about Speaker A's interest in teaching computer science and specifically in the field of robotics, which aligns with the current conversation where Speaker A expresses a desire to teach robotics. Speaker B's situation is also captured as they are considering getting a master's degree and becoming a college professor in linguistics, reflecting their feelings about career options. These elements are connected to the dialogue's present focus on exploring career paths and teaching as a potential occupation.\n\nHowever, there is a minor repetition in MEMORY about Speaker A working at a pizza shop and studying computer science, which slightly affects the flow and relevance. Furthermore, the statement about Speaker B majoring in linguistics causing Speaker A's interest in teaching robotics is not logically clear. Despite these issues, the MEMORY still provides useful context for Speaker A's aspirations and Speaker B's considerations, making it helpful. Therefore, the score awarded is 4."
