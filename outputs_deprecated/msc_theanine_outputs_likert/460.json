Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue.\nSpeaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad.\nSpeaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs!\nSpeaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours?\nSpeaker A: Ikea! Their furniture is not to expensive and they have all kinds of furniture that'll go with whatever scheme you're going for. What kind of patio furniture were you looking for? Like a barbeque, chairs, hammock? \nSpeaker B: I guess I was going to get like an umbrella table and some chairs to go with it or maybe even a screened in gazebo with a fire pit in the middle.\nSpeaker A: That's a great idea! Sounds like a very nice place for a barbeque. What were you planning on grilling for the barbeque? \nSpeaker B: I'll get the steaks to grill if you will bring the corn. And I have a request for you to play on the guitar, I know you are into country so if you could maybe play a song or two by Miranda Lambert, that would be awesome.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B are both discussing furniture and home decor choices, planning to meet up to exchange ideas. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company. \nSpeaker B is renovating their house to meet their living standards with their pets, planning to grill steaks this weekend using an old charcoal grill. Speaker A is excited about spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights. \nSpeaker A likely lives on a corn farm.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "Sure, I can definitely play some Miranda Lambert songs for you at the barbecue. I'll make sure to grab some corn too!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as mentioning furniture and home decor choices, which aligns with the ongoing conversation about patio furniture and color schemes. The MEMORY also notes that Speaker B is planning to grill steaks, which is relevant to the upcoming barbecue event mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, not all sentences in the MEMORY are directly useful for generating the next response. For instance, the mention of Speaker A living on a corn farm is not clearly connected to the current conversation about the barbecue and furniture. Additionally, the MEMORY does not mention important elements from the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A learning to play the guitar or the specific request for a song by Miranda Lambert. The information is generally phrased naturally, but not all aspects are directly applicable or beneficial for generating a response in line with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
