Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it?\nSpeaker B: Yes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see. \nSpeaker A: I definitely will, this sounds like such an amazing trip. How long has it been since you've been there yourself?\nSpeaker B: I was in Greece last two years ago.   I am excited to go again soon!    At somepoint I would like to take a cruise around the islands there.  It seems like a neat way to see all the Islands in an easy way.   Have you ever taken a cruise?\nSpeaker A: Only once before when I was very young, so I don't remember much. It sounds like such a relaxing way to enjoy the day, though. Maybe we can plan a cruise together sometime.\nSpeaker B: That would be fun!  I go to Europe a lot so maybe a cruise in the Caribbean would be nice.  I would like to see Saint Lucia and Saint Thomas. \nSpeaker A: Oh, Europe? I'm already sold on the idea, sounds like a blast! I've never had a negative experience in Europe. Should we visit some of the capital cities?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five because Speaker B has three kids. \nSpeaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian. Speaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five. Speaker B asks Speaker A if their trip is more for relaxation or sightseeing. \nSpeaker A has traveled around Europe before, visiting capital cities of each country because Speaker A has kids and is familiar with Greek mythology. Speaker A booked a plane ticket to Rome on a whim and is leaving in two weeks.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided is somewhat helpful but lacks a strong connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Here's why:\n\n1. **Mismatched Information**: MEMORY often conflicts or doesn't align with DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, it mentions Speaker B visiting Greece for the first time, which contradicts the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B states they were in Greece two years ago. Such discrepancies reduce the helpfulness of MEMORY.\n\n2. **Lack of Relevance**: MEMORY includes details such as Speaker A booking a plane ticket to Rome, which does not directly relate to the ongoing conversation about Greece and the Acropolis. Similarly, the reference to Speaker B's family size and kids doesn't enhance the contextual understanding needed for the next response. \n\n3. **Inconsistent Narratives**: The MEMORY contains redundant or inconsistent statements (e.g., Speaker B planning a trip to Greece in the next three months is mentioned twice) which do not add value to the dialogue or provide necessary development cues.\n\nThe MEMORY could be more helpful if it had more aligned and relevant details that build on what's been established in the context, offering specific and consistent background or intent that Speaker B might draw upon in their next response."
