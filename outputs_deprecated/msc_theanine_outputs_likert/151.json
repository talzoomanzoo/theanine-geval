Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?\nSpeaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping?\nSpeaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp?\nSpeaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer?\nSpeaker A: I've only camped in a tent so far, but would like to try out a camper trailer. What do use for camping?\nSpeaker B: We usually do tents but we have camped in yurts too. Did you go to the zoo last weekend?\nSpeaker A: I see. Yes, I did make it to the zoo.  Have you gone to your local zoo?\nSpeaker B: I went to the Bronx zoo it was amazing! Did you get to see Joshua?\nSpeaker A: I think the Bronx Zoo is one of the best in the country.   Yes, I did see Joshua.  Did you use a season pass for the zoo or just a one time ticket?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities. This has led Speaker B's child to want to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys. In return, Speaker A has a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo, particularly to see the tiger named Joshua.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "We used a season pass for the zoo. It's definitely worth it for frequent visits!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker A's enjoyment of visiting the zoo and particular interest in seeing a tiger named Joshua, which was mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY also contains information about Speaker A growing up in big cities and mentions Speaker B's child wanting to visit the zoo to see the monkeys, which is not directly relevant to the current context of the conversation. While these details are phrased naturally, they do not clearly contribute to the development of the conversation's current theme, which revolves around camping experiences and zoo visits. Thus, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful but not optimally aligned or fully relevant to the present dialogue."
