Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive.\nSpeaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price?\nSpeaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music\nSpeaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it.\nSpeaker A: I'll keep trying! Have you had any luck lately?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A values the peaceful life of working on the farm and suggests that Speaker B and their family could stay over at the farm after the concert. They also discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\nSpeaker A and Speaker B have a friendly interaction and part ways on a positive note, both having bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\nSpeaker B believes that luxurious items distract from the value of their family, while Speaker A bought 50 lotto tickets with different numbers to increase their chances of winning.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides some context regarding Speaker A and Speaker B's interactions and their discussions about the lotto, which is directly relevant to the latter part of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B jokingly suggests winning the lottery to cover the expense of the new iPhone. The MEMORY mentions strategies about playing the lotto and the potential outcomes, which ties into Speaker A's response about continuing to try. This connection is helpful for generating a response related to the conversation.\n\nHowever, other parts of the MEMORY, such as Speaker A valuing the peaceful life on a farm and the suggestion about staying over at the farm after a concert, are not directly related to the current conversation about iPhones and lottery tickets. These parts of the memory don't provide immediately relevant information for generating the next response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT, thus impacting its overall helpfulness. That said, these sentences are naturally phrased and do not interfere with understanding or identifying relevant information, hence the average score."
