Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods.\nSpeaker B: Oh that sounds fun! What is it about?\nSpeaker A: Black Widow is one of the character in the Marvel Avengers movies. Like Thor and Captain America. Have you seen any of those movies?\nSpeaker B: No I haven't seen any of those. What foods did you eat while watching the movie?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys spending time with their siblings and going out on their houseboat. Speaker A is looking forward to having dinner with their brother before going dancing. Speaker A's brother is a fan of Brazilian food, especially steak.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains information that is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically regarding Brazilian food. The mention that Speaker A's brother is a fan of Brazilian food, especially steak, could potentially inform the dialogue by providing context for why Speaker A and their brother might have chosen Brazilian foods during their outing. However, the rest of the MEMORY does not directly relate to the dialogue about the Black Widow movie or the specific foods eaten while watching the movie. Additionally, while the sentences in the MEMORY are naturally constructed, they do not demonstrate clear development or causality with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making it somewhat challenging for the language model to generate a highly relevant and connected response based on this MEMORY."
