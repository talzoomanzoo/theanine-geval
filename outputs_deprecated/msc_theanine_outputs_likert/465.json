Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it?\nSpeaker B: Yes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A's favorite cities from the trip were Rome, Berlin, Madrid, and Helsinki. Speaker B enjoys being outside and reading Star Wars novels. Speaker B recommends visiting the Parthenon, Acropolis of Athens, and the beach on Corfu Island in Greece. \nSpeaker A's mother is a pediatrician. Speaker A has kids and is familiar with Greek mythology. Speaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five. Speaker B and their kids are excited about their upcoming trip to Greece. \nSpeaker A and Speaker B both enjoy reading and are librarians. Speaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian. Speaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five. Speaker B recommends visiting the Parthenon, Acropolis of Athens, and the beach on Corfu Island in Greece.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds amazing, I can't wait to explore the museum and learn more about the history of the Acropolis. Thank you for the recommendation!",
    "prediction": "3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains relevant information such as Speaker B's recommendation to visit the Parthenon and Acropolis of Athens in Greece, which directly relates to Speaker A's mention of visiting the Acropolis. Additionally, the MEMORY highlights that Speaker A is familiar with Greek mythology, which could be used to enhance the response.\n\nHowever, other details in the MEMORY, such as Speaker A's favorite cities or Speaker B's love for Star Wars novels, are not directly relevant to the current dialogue context. While they provide background on the speaker's preferences and interests, they do not clearly contribute to developing a response about the Acropolis.\n\nThus, the MEMORY is structured so that relevant pieces could be useful, but the connections and relevance of all sentences to the dialogue context are not consistently demonstrated."
