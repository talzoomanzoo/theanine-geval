Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\nSpeaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call!\nSpeaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip? \nSpeaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has a lot of kids, all grown up now and with kids of their own. This causes Speaker A to have kids and be busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. Speaker B, in turn, wants to spend time with their grandkids at the park, enjoying the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n\nSpeaker A, a librarian who loves kids, mentions having 3 children. This leads to Speaker A being busy with work and unable to spend as much time with their kids as they would like. Speaker B, who has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park, took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's a great idea, I'll definitely consider switching up the locations for our annual fishing trip with the grandkids. Thanks for the suggestion!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B having grandkids and enjoying spending time with them, which aligns with their statement about spending great time with their grandkids. The MEMORY also mentions Speaker B's interest in making the fishing trip an annual tradition, which connects to their inquiry about planning the fishing trip in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY also includes some information that is not directly relevant or necessary for generating a response in the current context, such as Speaker A's occupation and their situation with their own children. While these details are naturally phrased, they don't directly contribute to the development of the current dialogue. Therefore, the MEMORY is moderately helpful, providing some relevant context but also containing less useful information."
