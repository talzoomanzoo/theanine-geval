Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college?\nSpeaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position. \nSpeaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it?\nSpeaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \nSpeaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living.\nSpeaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker, has a match next week, and is a member of a soccer team that competes in tournaments.\n2. Speaker A has been performing well in soccer recently, scoring goals.\n3. Speaker A joked about treating Speaker B to lunch, suggesting that Speaker B is currently low on cash, and Speaker B offered to connect Speaker A with someone working in HR.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The information about Speaker A playing as a striker and being a member of a soccer team is relevant, as it pertains to their shared interest in soccer. This could potentially lead to a natural continuation of their conversation. However, the connection between these memories and the immediate context of the conversation (discussing past positions and roles in soccer) is tenuous. The detail about Speaker A's good performance and scoring goals adds some context but isn't directly relevant to the conversation about positions and aspirations. Additionally, the memory about Speaker A joking about treating Speaker B to lunch and connecting them to someone in HR seems unrelated to the current topic of soccer and aspirations, offering little help for progressing the soccer-focused discussion. Therefore, while the MEMORY contains relevant elements, they aren't fully utilized to enhance the current conversation, justifying a mid-range score."
