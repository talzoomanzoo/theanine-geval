    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read.\nSpeaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting? \nSpeaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far.\nSpeaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes. \nSpeaker A: why don't you like books like that?\nSpeaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading?\nSpeaker A: Not yet.  I think Netflix is going to make it into a movie soon.  They might finally convince me to pay for a subscription haha.\nSpeaker B: Well if it's any good I know you'll be watching the whole thing.\nSpeaker A: you know it.  And I know that you would just fall asleep during it whether it's any good or not.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A's energetic grandchildren have grown old enough to entertain themselves with technology or TV, allowing Speaker A to suggest taking naps during quiet times and mentioning watching her grandkids.\n2. After running out of things to watch, Speaker A, tired from spending time with their energetic grandchildren, turns to Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars.\n3. Speaker A, with 8 grandchildren, finds solace in reading books and watching Netflix, suggesting taking naps during quiet times and mentioning watching her grandkids.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does provide some background on Speaker A's life, such as having grandchildren and an interest in reading and Netflix. However, it lacks direct relevance or connection to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY mentions Speaker A's grandchildren and tendency to take naps, but these details do not provide significant insight or helpfulness regarding the ongoing discussion about books and movies. The MEMORY also repeats certain ideas, such as taking naps and watching Netflix, without offering new or helpful information for generating the next response in the dialogue. Overall, the MEMORY could be more structured to reflect the development of interactions between the two speakers in a manner that is more directly applicable to the current conversation."
