    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for.\nSpeaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for?\nSpeaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\nSpeaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A, a recent high school graduate on a cross-country journey looking for jobs, wants to potentially visit the Columbia Trail and Ken Lockwood Gorge for a camping and hiking trip. They also applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail. As a result, Speaker A plans to leave a hammock by the river for anyone to use at a hidden spot off the main hiking trail, and now has a portable hammock for the hike, asking Speaker B to bring theirs.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does provide some relevant information about Speaker A's interest in hiking and applying for a job at a grocery store near a hiking trail, aligning somewhat with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A mentions getting a job offer from a grocery store. However, the MEMORY predominantly focuses on Speaker A's camping and hiking plans, which doesn't directly contribute to generating an appropriate next response concerning the job offer and subsequent conversation about Speaker B's current work situation. The connection between the MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is weak, as the MEMORY lacks detail on the job or any past interactions likely to be helpful in continuing the current conversation. Additionally, the MEMORY's structure and the nature of its content do not strongly assist in understanding the development of Speaker A and Speaker B's interactions related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT specifically."
