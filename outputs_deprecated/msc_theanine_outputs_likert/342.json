Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it! Thank you for the recommendation.\nSpeaker B: Of course. I recommend that movie to everyone I meet. I think I've watched it over one hundred times. So what is the next movie on your list to watch soon?\nSpeaker A: Yeah it was great and I will also recommend to people when they ask what movie is good. So next is another one you recommended which is coming to America. What’s the next movie your going to watch? \nSpeaker B: There is a horror genre movie that was released just this week which I'm going to watch tonight. It is called \"Girl Next.\"\nSpeaker A: Oh that sounds interesting, I will look into that and put it on my list. How has your job been going? Is there where you get all these great ideas for what to watch?  \nSpeaker B: My Film Studies professor job has been going absolutely great lately. I love all my students, because they really get into the lectures and ask lots of questions. Yes, my job requires me to watch movies all the time, so that is how I find the best ones. Is your programmer job going all right lately?\nSpeaker A: That sounds amazing. Super lucky to have students that really enjoy what they are learning about and I’m sure that’s down to the way you teach and what you teach them. I’m so glad it is all going well for you. Yeah it is going much better now, I’m really getting in the swing of things thank you for asking. \nSpeaker B: You're welcome. So, returning to the subject of Pulp Fiction, did you think it was funny? Did you think it was too violent for kids to watch?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, who used to teach Film Studies and carefully chooses what movies to watch, has a sister who shares the same opinion about age as Speaker A. Speaker A is interested in watching movies, mentioned Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman. \nSpeaker B, who has kids and enjoys watching movies with them, enjoys watching suspense films, action, SF, horror, westerns, drama, and occasional good comedy. Speaker B is knowledgeable about movies and provides recommendations based on Speaker A's preferences.\nSpeaker B, who used to teach Film Studies and carefully chooses what movies to watch, highlighted Eddie Murphy's success in cop roles in movies like Beverly Hills Cop trilogy and \"I-SPY.\"\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I did find Pulp Fiction funny, and as for the violence, I think it might be a bit too intense for kids to watch.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some useful information that would be beneficial for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker B's background in Film Studies, which is relevant to their conversation about movies. It also notes that Speaker B enjoys watching various genres, which supports the context of recommending and discussing movies. However, much of the MEMORY is not directly connected to the specific flow or development of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the mention of Speaker B's sister and her opinions, which is irrelevant to the current conversation. Furthermore, the MEMORY could be structured more naturally to show clearer connections or causality, as it currently reads as a set of disjointed facts rather than a coherent memory of past interactions. Improving these aspects would make the MEMORY more helpful."
