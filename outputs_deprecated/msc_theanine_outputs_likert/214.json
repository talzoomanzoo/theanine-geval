Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships!\nSpeaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!   I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field?\nSpeaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate?\nSpeaker B: I have another year- so this year is really important I get internships and start making connections in the field.   I love going to the beach too.  What happened with your knees that now cause you so much pain?\nSpeaker A: I think age has really been my knees downfall. I also used to hike a lot and I put a lot of pressure on my legs. That is great that you only have a year. Maybe when you graduate you can come hang out on the beach with me. I can't surf but I would love to watch you.\nSpeaker B: That would be fun!  I like collecting shells too so we could do that as well.  I have a small collection of ones I have from around the world.  The farthest away was from Greece.  Have you traveled a lot?\nSpeaker A: I have. I love Europe. I have been to many countries there but I have not gone to Greece yet. I would love to. The scenery and architecture is amazing. Have you gotten to visit other European countries?\nSpeaker B: I have.   I have also been to France and Ireland.  Where have you been in Europe?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, a college student studying sports medicine and playing soccer, is seeking to join their college team in the future. Speaker B's professors have been supportive in writing letters for an internship application. Speaker A is offering advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field.\n\nSpeaker B, a college student studying sports medicine and playing soccer, has been spending a lot of time at the beach and is learning to surf from friends in Jersey. Speaker A suggests that surfing could be a way for Speaker B to make connections in the medical field.\n\nSpeaker A enjoys hiking along the coast and collecting shells, mentioning that their knees can't handle much else.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've been to Italy, Spain, and Germany. Each country had its own unique charm and history. What was your favorite part about France and Ireland?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY does provide some relevant information, but it is not particularly helpful for generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memory contains information about Speaker B's background, including their interest in sports medicine and soccer, which could be helpful, but it lacks specific connections to the dialogue's immediate context. It also mentions the beach and surfing, which are tangentially related to the conversation, but the suggestion that surfing could be a way to make connections in the medical field seems disconnected from the flow of the dialogue. Additionally, the mention of Speaker A's enjoyment of hiking and shell collecting partially overlaps with the conversation, but the emphasis on knee issues is more relevant. Overall, the memory lacks cohesiveness and direct relevance to the ongoing conversation, reducing its helpfulness."
