    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A's interest in animals, specifically raccoons and bearded dragons, was sparked by their work in software solutions for tech companies, which they find less exciting than being a zoo keeper. They are currently dealing with a raccoon problem and plan to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes. Additionally, Speaker B has been taking care of a raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information by giving context about Speaker A's current raccoon problem and their plan to use aluminum sheeting as a solution, which directly relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY also includes Speaker B's interest in raccoons and their experience taking care of one, which could inform Speaker B's response in the conversation. Additionally, the MEMORY includes details about Speaker A's broader interest in animals and their background, which helps to form a clearer picture of the speakers and their interactions. Overall, the MEMORY is relevant and well-structured in a way that benefits generating a proper next response, although it's slightly less focused on the specific task without additional details linking future actions or past interactions more tightly."
