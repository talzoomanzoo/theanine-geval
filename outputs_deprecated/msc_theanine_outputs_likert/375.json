Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens?\nSpeaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month\nSpeaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.  Where are you going on vacation?\nSpeaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there!\nSpeaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo?\nSpeaker B: Their zoo is pretty good! It's always crowded, of course, but they have pandas so I'm happy. I would say it's bigger than the DC zoo, but I like that the DC zoo has fewer people.\nSpeaker A: That sounds awesome.  I haven't been to the zoo in so long.  I wish I could go.\nSpeaker B: You should go with your sister! she can bring her dog. They probably have all kinds of exotic birds...\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B enjoy visiting the zoo and discussing hobbies and interests. Speaker B's girlfriend loves pandas and penguins at the zoo, and they go there regularly. Speaker A has been to the zoo before and likes seeing exotic birds. Speaker A prefers cockatoos over kittens as pets. \nSpeaker A's sister recently got married, which was exciting for them. Speaker A enjoys pandas and penguins at the zoo and goes with their sister. This caused Speaker A's sister to become a dog person with a yellow lab. Speaker B is willing to be a cool uncle to his sister's future children but does not want kids of his own. \nSpeaker B, who has a cat that recently had a kitten, also enjoys visiting the zoo. Speaker A enjoys pandas and penguins at the zoo and goes with their sister. This causes Speaker A's sister to become a dog person with a yellow lab. Speaker B is open to being a cool uncle to his sister's future children but does not want kids of his own.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "That's a great idea! I'll have to plan a trip with her soon.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but contains some redundancy and less relevant details. It acknowledges the fact that both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy visiting the zoo. It also points out that Speaker A prefers exotic birds, which complements the conversation about zoos and interests. Speaker B has a connection to a kitten, aligning with the kitten mention in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY includes repeated information about pandas and penguins, as well as some details about Speaker B's girlfriend and Speaker A's sister that do not add much to the context of the current conversation. While these are naturally phrased, they do not significantly aid in developing Speaker A's next response outside the context of zoos and exotic birds. The mention of Speaker B's girlfriend loving pandas and penguins, as well as the matter of Speaker A's sister's marriage, does not provide a helpful backdrop for the current dialogue.\n\nOverall, while MEMORY provides some alignments to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly surrounding the zoo, kittens, and some shared interests, further consolidation and focus on the most relevant points would make it more beneficial in generating a response. Therefore, it merits a middle score."
