Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys watching movies with her kids, and they all really enjoyed watching 'Miracle'.\n2. Speaker B's kids enjoy watching Disney movies, which Speaker B also finds good, and Speaker B recommends Speaker A to watch 'Miracle'.\n3. Speaker B's kids enjoyed watching 'Luca' and said it was good, despite Speaker B preferring romance and horror movies, which their kids do not enjoy.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. In particular, the first sentence directly aligns with the context as it mentions that Speaker B and their kids enjoyed watching 'Miracle,' which Speaker A refers to in their statement. This connection is helpful for generating a pertinent response. The second sentence adds context about Speaker B recommending the movie 'Miracle' to Speaker A and aligns well with the exchange. The third sentence is slightly less relevant but still offers context about Speaker B's movie preferences and contrasts their tastes with their children's, which is constructive for understanding Speaker B's character. The MEMORY is well-structured, providing an organic flow of information about Speaker B and their family's movie watching that can help in future conversation. Overall, the details about past interactions between Speaker A and B regarding movies are naturally phrased and useful. However, for a perfect score, all sentences should directly add value to the specific dialogue context."
