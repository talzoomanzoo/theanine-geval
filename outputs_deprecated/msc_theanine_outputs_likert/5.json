Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet as Speaker B received a new car from their mom and plans to drive during spring break.\nSpeaker A, a retired librarian, recommends the book \"Beautiful Ruins\" by Jess Walter for a beach visit, contrasting with Speaker A's quiet spring breaks in the past.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about Speaker B's upcoming trip and Speaker A's book recommendation. However, it lacks direct relevance to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY mentions Speaker B's new car and plans to drive during spring break, which isn't connected to the dialogue where they're discussing the plane trip to Costa Rica and book interests. Speaker A's recommendation of \"Beautiful Ruins\" doesn't relate directly to the book being discussed, \"The Gettysburg Campaign.\" While the pieces of MEMORY provide some background information, they do not help in generating a relevant response based on the ongoing conversation about Costa Rica and historical books. The connection and development of past interactions in relation to the dialogue context are quite limited."
