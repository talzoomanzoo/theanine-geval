Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing?\nSpeaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from?\nSpeaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there.\nSpeaker B: That's great. I have gotten my pets from the shelter and they seem happy I brought them home. I have a hard time saying no to them which is why I have so many pets. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs. Do you have a name in mind for your cat? \nSpeaker A: I've thought of a lot of  names, but in the end it will probably depend on the breed and the sex.  \nSpeaker B: That's true. Is pilates hard? I've always wanted to try it but I don't know if it will be too difficult.\nSpeaker A: No, I don't think it's hard.  I actually enjoy it.  It's more fun than work, at least to me. You should give it a try!\nSpeaker B: Maybe I will. Do you think I can start at home by watching Youtube videos, or do I need to go to a Pilates class?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals, discovered love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets.\nSpeaker B thinks pit bulls are lovely and has one that is kind and sweet.\nSpeaker B is considering getting kittens and thinks rats can be smart.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "You can definitely start at home with YouTube videos, but going to a Pilates class can provide more guidance and motivation. Either way, it's worth trying out!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information that could potentially influence the responses generated in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives insight into Speaker B's preferences and thoughts about pets, which is tangentially relevant since they are discussing pets in the dialogue. The memory that Speaker B discovered a love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets could be connected to the dialogue topic of painting portraits. However, the second and third sentences about pit bulls and getting kittens do not directly relate to the current dialogue context, where the specific focus is on painting, Pilates, and intention to get a new cat. The sentences in MEMORY are naturally structured, allowing a language model to discern relevant cues with some effort, but they do not strongly aid in generating specific next responses based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
