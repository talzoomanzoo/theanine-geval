Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it! Thank you for the recommendation.\nSpeaker B: Of course. I recommend that movie to everyone I meet. I think I've watched it over one hundred times. So what is the next movie on your list to watch soon?\nSpeaker A: Yeah it was great and I will also recommend to people when they ask what movie is good. So next is another one you recommended which is coming to America. What’s the next movie your going to watch? \nSpeaker B: There is a horror genre movie that was released just this week which I'm going to watch tonight. It is called \"Girl Next.\"\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B, who just turned 40 and considers themselves too old for certain activities, used to teach Film Studies and carefully chooses what movies to watch. Speaker A, interested in watching movies, mentioned Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman.\n2. Speaker B, who has kids and enjoys watching movies with them, used to teach Film Studies and carefully chooses what movies to watch. Speaker B, knowledgeable about movies, provides recommendations based on Speaker A's preferences.\n3. Speaker A enjoys programming and plans to go for a long run after work. Speaker B enjoys watching suspense films, action, SF, horror, westerns, drama, and occasional good comedy. Speaker B highlighted Eddie Murphy's success in cop roles in movies like Beverly Hills Cop trilogy and \"I-SPY.\"\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides some information that is somewhat related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it mentions that Speaker B is knowledgeable about movies and recommends films based on Speaker A's preferences. This connection is relevant, as Speaker B is recommending movies to Speaker A. Furthermore, the MEMORY also highlights that Speaker B used to teach Film Studies, indicating an expertise in movies which supports the recommendation of films. \n\nHowever, much of the MEMORY information is irrelevant to the specific DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, details about Speaker A's interest in programming, running, and Speaker B's opinions on Eddie Murphy's roles do not contribute significantly to generating the next response in the context of the current conversation about movies. Additionally, the information about Speaker B's age and view on certain activities doesn't play a part in enhancing the current dialogue’s progression.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY contains some relevant information that aids understanding of Speaker B's expertise in movies, but it also contains sparse and largely unrelated details that do not necessarily benefit the generation of a future response in this conversation."
