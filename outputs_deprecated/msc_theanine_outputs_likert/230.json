Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet? \nSpeaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is interested in adopting a rescue kitten and has a parrot named Tasha who speaks Mandarin. Speaker B has two sick kitties and recently received a rescue, and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities. Speaker A has a pet parrot named Tasha and has red hair that makes them stand out. Speaker B has an older mellow cat and is concerned about training the new energetic kittens.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information that relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It notes that Speaker B recently received a rescue kitten and is considering giving them Mandarin names, which ties in with the discussion about naming kittens. This could help generate a conversation related to naming the kittens. Additionally, knowing that Speaker B has two sick kittens and an older mellow cat might provide context for concerns about the new kittens, but it isnâ€™t directly tied to the immediate context of naming. The information about Speaker A having a pet parrot named Tasha who speaks Mandarin and having red hair does not add much to the dialogue context of naming the kittens. Overall, there is some relevant information, but it could be better structured and detailed to provide clearer cues for generating the next response."
