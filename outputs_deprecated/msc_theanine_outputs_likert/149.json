Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?\nSpeaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping?\nSpeaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp?\nSpeaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer?\nSpeaker A: I've only camped in a tent so far, but would like to try out a camper trailer. What do use for camping?\nSpeaker B: We usually do tents but we have camped in yurts too. Did you go to the zoo last weekend?\nSpeaker A: I see. Yes, I did make it to the zoo.  Have you gone to your local zoo?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities. This is why Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys. In contrast, Speaker B's daughter likes monkeys and is starting to assert her independence. On a similar note, Speaker B is interested in finding family discounts for the zoo as well as pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, we've been to our local zoo a few times. It's always a fun outing, especially for our daughter.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that can aid the language model in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It aligns with the current conversation topic about visiting the zoo and Speaker B's daughter. The MEMORY notes that Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and goes there weekly, particularly seeing tigers and monkeys, which can be used in future interactions when discussing zoo trips. It also mentions Speaker B's daughter's interest in monkeys and her growing independence, which continues the conversation about Speaker B's family experiences. However, the MEMORY could be more helpful if it contained information about camping preferences or experiences, as this is a primary topic in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Furthermore, the MEMORY could be structured more naturally to better represent the interactions between the two speakers in past conversations and enhance contextual coherence."
