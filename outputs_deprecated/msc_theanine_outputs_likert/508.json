Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both have two sons, and Speaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite worrying about them traveling far away. Speaker B is trying to encourage one of their sons to get into programming or writing, but the son is more interested in gaming with friends. Speaker A's sons play video games and listen to music in their rooms. Speaker B is good at ice skating and suggests going to an ice skating rink during winter break.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "Yes, they enjoy ice skating too. It's a fun activity we all like to do together during the winter.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful background information, such as Speaker B being good at ice skating and suggesting it as an activity, which relates to the mention of ice skating in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the other details in the MEMORY, such as the sons' interests in programming, gaming, or how Speaker A worries about them traveling, are not directly relevant to the context of ice skating. While they offer a general view of the sons' interests, which may inform the conversation slightly, they don't significantly contribute to generating a direct response to whether the sons like ice skating. The MEMORY could be more focused on past interactions between the sons and ice skating to score higher."
