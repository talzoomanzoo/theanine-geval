Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country. This has led Speaker A to consider visiting their cousin in Sweden and the need to save money for the trip. As a result, Speaker A and Speaker B are planning to travel to Sweden together. \nSpeaker B, who is from Sweden, mentioned playing tennis and going to church on Sunday. This has sparked Speaker A's consideration of visiting their cousin in Sweden and the need to save money for the trip. Speaker A, having a flexible job, is contemplating taking a second part-time job to save money for travel. \nSpeaker A, who likes playing badminton, has a cousin who recently moved to Sweden. This has resulted in Speaker A considering visiting their cousin in Sweden. Additionally, both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy exploring local music and coffee shops when traveling.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm hoping to visit Sweden again soon, maybe this summer. I miss playing tennis and going to church on Sundays there.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information, such as Speaker A having a cousin in Sweden, which has led to the consideration of visiting the country. However, there are also multiple sentences that are repetitive and not particularly helpful for the dialogue context. The MEMORY lacks clear causality and connection to the specifics discussed in the dialogue, such as the mention of castles in Visby and plans to revisit Sweden. While it provides background on Speaker A's motivations and activities, it doesn't explicitly tie in with the specific interaction and planning details important for Speaker A's trip. The detailed activities of Speaker B, such as playing tennis and going to church, feel disconnected from the conversation context and planning inquiry from Speaker A. Overall, the MEMORY provides some useful context but is not fully optimized to support generating a next response based on the current context."
