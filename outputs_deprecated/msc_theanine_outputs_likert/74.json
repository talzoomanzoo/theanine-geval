Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play? \nSpeaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music.\nSpeaker A: ah right, who's your favourite rock band?\nSpeaker B: I'm big fan of aerosmith. When do you learn music. Whom teach you?\nSpeaker A: aerosmith are great, have you ever seen them live? I have been playing drums since i was a kid, my father taught me when I was young and from then on I just taught myself\nSpeaker B: That's awesome! I have been trying to learn last one year. Still I didn't get right teacher. I'm jealous on you. I don't have like your dad.\nSpeaker A: what instrument have you been trying to learn?\nSpeaker B: Piano is my favorite instrument. When try play my mind was mesmerizing. How do you learn surfering?\nSpeaker A: I learnt to surf from one of my good friends, he surfed in a number of competitions and did very well. Would you like to learn to surf if you had more time?\n\nMEMORY:\n- Speaker A grew up in California on the beach and loves morning surfing, while Speaker B wishes they had time to go surfing and is considering getting lessons at a surf shop.\n- Speaker B listens to Sublime a lot while relaxing on the beach, and is looking forward to taking a break from work and going fishing. They find fishing easier than surfing, but are interested in trying surfing, and are willing to teach Speaker A how to fish and cook.\n- Speaker B loves fishing and spending time near the ocean, but doesn't have time to surf anymore due to working at a doctor's office. Speaker A enjoys surfing and music as a way to escape from daily life, and Speaker B wishes they had time to go surfing and is considering getting lessons at a surf shop.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "I would definitely love to learn to surf if I had more time. It sounds like an amazing experience.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly related to Speaker B's interest in surfing and their lack of time to pursue it. This is relevant to Speaker A's question about whether Speaker B would like to learn to surf if they had more time. Additionally, Speaker A's enjoyment of both surfing and music is also touched upon in the MEMORY, which connects to their background with music as discussed in the context.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY also contains information that is not directly beneficial to generating the next response, such as details about Speaker B's fishing habits and working at a doctor's office. While these details are naturally phrased, they do not directly influence or connect to the development of the current dialogue about music and surfing.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY captures some relevant points but also includes extraneous information that does not strongly relate to the ongoing conversation, warranting a mid-level score."
