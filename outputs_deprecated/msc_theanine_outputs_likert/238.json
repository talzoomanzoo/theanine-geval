Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet? \nSpeaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name?\nSpeaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \nSpeaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along!\nSpeaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them.\nSpeaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me!\nSpeaker A: Hahaha. Yes I agree its too hot to get a long hike in. I've been on some short ones, but the bugs eat me alive. I like to hike in the fall when the bugs are dying off and its a little cooler.\nSpeaker B: Ah yes, that's my favorite time of year. Oh and speaking of Tasha, I'm still amazed she knows Mandarin. Have you been learning more of the language?\nSpeaker A: I've been learning a little more. I try to learn a few things a day. Tasha's reactions to my talking to myself in Mandarin is funny, she looks confused most of the time.\nSpeaker B: That is funny. And impressive that you're learning. The closest I can get to another language is doing a bad New York accent LOL\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B loves animals, lives in the city they grew up in, and has a cat that recently had a kitten. This led Speaker B to have two sick kitties and recently receive a rescue. Speaker A, on the other hand, has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n\nSpeaker A, a country girl who loves animals and is a lacto-ovo vegetarian, now has a pet named Tasha who speaks Mandarin. As a result, Speaker A has been learning Mandarin, and Tasha has started saying Chinese phrases instead of English ones. This has led Speaker A to be interested in adopting a rescue kitten, similar to Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "Haha, well, at least a New York accent adds some flair! I'm sure Tasha finds your Mandarin quite entertaining.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides useful and relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It helps in understanding the context around Speaker A and Speaker B's conversations regarding animals, particularly the kittens and the parrot, Tasha. The connections between Speaker A learning Mandarin due to Tasha's influence and Speaker B's interest in adopting/rescuing animals are clear and logically presented. Some aspects, such as Speaker B considering giving kittens Mandarin names based on their personalities, add depth and context to the ongoing conversation about language and animals. The MEMORYs structure could benefit from a more direct linkage to the specific context of the ongoing dialogue (e.g., hiking or hot weather), but it overall provides a solid foundation for the language model to generate coherent and relevant responses."
