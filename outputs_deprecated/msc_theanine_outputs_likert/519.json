Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B drove over 1000 miles to see their favorite band, Three Dog Night. This caused Speaker B to enjoy living in the city for the accessibility to food and live music. Speaker A enjoys going to museums and trying different foods. Speaker A and their boyfriend also look forward to having some refreshing beers by the beach.\nSpeaker B drove over 1000 miles to see their favorite band, Three Dog Night.

    "raw_prediction": "I'm still waiting for the bands to announce their summer tour schedule. Can't wait to see who's coming to town!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information regarding musical interests and events related to Speaker B, which can aid in understanding Speaker B's potential enthusiasm for concerts. Sentences like \"Speaker B drove over 1000 miles to see their favorite band, Three Dog Night\" demonstrate their passion for music, which can relate to the question about music concerts. Furthermore, the MEMORY mentions that Speaker B is \"waiting for bands to announce their summer tour schedule,\" which directly connects to Speaker A's question about upcoming concerts. However, the MEMORY also contains information that is not directly related to the dialogue context or may not be explicitly useful, such as details about family and Speaker A's interests in museums and Sao Paulo. While these details are naturally phrased, they do not aid in generating the next response regarding music concerts, thus making the overall helpfulness moderate rather than high."
