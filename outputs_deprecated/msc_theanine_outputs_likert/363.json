Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week?\nSpeaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you?\nSpeaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions?\nSpeaker B: Unfortunately I mainly play games similar to RE. I don't know why I like them so much. I remember when I was little my brother play Doom and it gave me nightmares for a week. What genre of games you like?\nSpeaker A: I like all kinds of games. I like party, fighting, RPGs, shooters, action, adventure, and puzzle games. I enjoy playing Jurassic Park: World but I'd like to find another game to play. The storm means I'll be inside for a bit, so I think I'll curl up with some pizza and just zone out. Do you like to do anything else besides game when it's rainy?\nSpeaker B: Well, I might help around the house with cleaning or laundry, but not that much. Mostly gaming. If I feel I sat too long, I'll switch to Nintendo Switch's Ring Fit Adventure to get my body moving a bit. Do yo know that game?\nSpeaker A: I've heard of it. I think I need to get some exercise, so that might be a good idea. I'd like to stay in shape as much as I can. I guess games are the best way to do that! That's a good suggestion. How about you? Do you only like games like RE? What other genres do you like?\n\nMEMORY:\n- Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World.\n- Speaker B plays Resident Evil VIII alone in the dark to make it scarier and provides some tips for playing it.\n- Speaker B is interested in playing Jurassic Park: World but has not played it yet.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nMEMORY provides some useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures Speaker A's interest in Jurassic Park: World and hesitance towards Resident Evil, which pertains to the conversation about game preferences. Additionally, it notes Speaker B's interest in Resident Evil and offers insight into their gaming experience, although the specific mention of Resident Evil VIII and playing in the dark is not directly connected to the dialogue. The mention of tips for Resident Evil is not really reflected within the dialogue context but may be helpful, depending on future directions of the conversation. The entry about Speaker B's interest in Jurassic Park: World is slightly relevant and well phrased but not crucial, as Speaker B is portrayed as familiar with Resident Evil-like games. Overall, MEMORY has aspects that are relevant but lacks certain depth in establishing connection and causal development that could fully contextualize Speaker B's response generation for future dialogue from the provided context."
