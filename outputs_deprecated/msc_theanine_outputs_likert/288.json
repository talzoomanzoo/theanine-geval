Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \nSpeaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with?\nSpeaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point.\nSpeaker A: Yes, it contains eggs.  I think you would do well with the fried rice. It's best to cook the rice the day before.  \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys cooking and baking, possibly considering turning it into a business. This is similar to Speaker B's husband, who is a great cook and enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work. Speaker B, on the other hand, is not skilled in cooking but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker. In addition, Speaker B also mentions having a farm with animals like chickens, ducks, pigs, goats, and growing crops like corn, strawberries, and pumpkins. This resonates with Speaker A, who owns a farm and enjoys cooking and baking. This has led Speaker A to become a cook and enjoy using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides a mix of useful and less useful information for generating a next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n- Useful information: The MEMORY mentions Speaker B's interest in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker, which aligns with the current conversation where Speaker B is being advised on beginner recipes and using a pressure cooker. This connection to the present context can help generate a more relevant and tailored response for Speaker B. Additionally, Speaker B's mention of having a farm with chickens ties into the current discussion about eggs and cooking.\n\n- Less useful information: The MEMORY contains details about both speakers' interests in cooking and farming that are not directly relevant to the current dialogue about a specific recipe recommendation. While these details provide a broader understanding of the speakers' backgrounds and potential common interests, they do not directly aid in the task of selecting a recipe or discussing cooking specifics.\n\nOverall, while the MEMORY provides some contextual foundation, the connections to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT are not as explicitly clear or necessary for generating the immediate next response, resulting in a mid-range helpfulness score."
