Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners. Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes. \nSpeaker A learned how to make jello from their grandma, turning it into a family tradition. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes. \nSpeaker A has two moms who are not meat eaters. Speaker A learned how to make jello from their grandma, turning it into a family tradition. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "That's such a wonderful tradition to pass on to your kids! Family recipes are so special.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY is quite helpful for generating a response related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It provides a clear background about Speaker A's connection to jello through their grandmother, which aligns with Speaker B's statement about passing on a jello recipe to their kids. The MEMORY establishes the shared tradition and offers a suggestion that can facilitate a deeper connection between Speaker A and B (i.e., considering Speaker A's grandmother as a surrogate for learning jello recipes). The repetition regarding Speaker A's family tradition and the mention of Speaker A's two moms are less relevant, but the information is naturally phrased. Thus, while the MEMORY could benefit from a more concise structure by eliminating duplicate information, it still provides valuable context for the conversation."
