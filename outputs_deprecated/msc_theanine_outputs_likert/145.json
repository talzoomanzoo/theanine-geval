    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?\nSpeaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping?\nSpeaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities. Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys. Speaker A is offering advice and seems to have experience with children. \n\nSpeaker A compares having a kitten to being a grandparent and mentions starting their own zoo. Speaker B expresses concern about leaving a kitten alone during their family camping adventures. \n\nSpeaker A suggests taking the pets to the zoo and mentions that most major cities have good zoos. Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY primarily provides information concerning visits to the zoo and Speaker B's child's interest in monkeys. However, in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT, the discussion is about camping experiences and locations, which is not directly related to the MEMORY content. The MEMORY does highlight Speaker B's concern about leaving a pet alone during family camping adventures, which aligns partially with the camping topic, but this is a minor point and not thoroughly developed. Overall, the MEMORY does not sufficiently help Speaker B generate a nuanced or contextually relevant response focused on camping, as most of it revolves around a zoo-related narrative and lacks clear development or causal connections pertinent to the current dialogue."
