Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot, hoping to change their luck.\n2. Speaker A bought 50 lotto tickets with different numbers to increase their chances of winning, despite Speaker B's belief that luxurious items distract from the value of their family.\n3. Speaker B leads a hectic life but is interested in attending the concert with their kids during winter break, even though they believe that luxurious items distract from the value of their family. This interest may have been influenced by Speaker B's children being sick and Speaker B having a fever, leading them to buy 20 lotto tickets.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information about buying lotto tickets and beliefs about luxurious items, which has a weak connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT regarding Speaker A's purchase of a new expensive iPhone. There is some potential relevance in the shared theme of spending money and the idea of luxurious items not aligning with certain values, represented by Speaker B's views, but the connection is not strong or direct enough to provide significant help in generating a proper next response. Furthermore, the additional details about a hectic life, concerts, and children being sick do not seem to contribute directly to the current dialogue about buying an expensive item. Overall, the MEMORY provides limited and somewhat indirect helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
