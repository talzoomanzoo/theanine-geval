Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is a high school student planning to go to college, achieving straight A's. Speaker B is considering giving up their night job to focus on lab work and school.\nSpeaker B is also a high school student preparing for college, working at a diner at night. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\nSpeaker B is also a high school student preparing for college, working at a diner at night. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner. Speaker A had cheesy ham and potato soup for dinner. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Definitely, I'd be curious to try it! It would be interesting to see if there's any difference in taste.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some contextual information that could be useful for generating a response. It reveals insights about Speaker B's potential decision-making process regarding their job and school commitments, which ties into the dialogue context where Speaker B mentions possibly quitting if classes are too hard. Additionally, it mentions both speakers being high school students preparing for college, which relates to their future plans and commitments. However, several details, such as specific foods and the invention of the chili dog casserole, do not directly contribute to the current dialogue context about lab work and cloned cows. While these extraneous details are not phrased disruptively, they don't enhance the conversation's immediate focus on cloning and educational planning, thus making the MEMORY moderately helpful."
