Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college?\nSpeaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position. \nSpeaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it?\nSpeaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \nSpeaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living.\nSpeaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime?\nSpeaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with.\nSpeaker A: Sounds great! Now the tough question: when do you have time?\nSpeaker B: It would have to be sometime when I'm off work, maybe on the weekend. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket and is a member of a soccer team, enjoying playing in tournaments. \nSpeaker A played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United. \nSpeaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week, being a fan of Arsenal and enjoying watching international teams play.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY offers some relevant context that could aid in generating a response. It mentions that Speaker A is a member of a soccer team, plays as a striker, and is a fan of Manchester United and Arsenal. Some of this information could contribute to a more personally tailored response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where they are discussing soccer-related topics. However, MEMORY could be more helpful if it included more personal past interactions between Speaker A and Speaker B or more details that directly connect to the current conversation, such as prior discussions about playing soccer together. Overall, MEMORY provides useful insights but could be improved to show stronger development or causality relevant to this DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
