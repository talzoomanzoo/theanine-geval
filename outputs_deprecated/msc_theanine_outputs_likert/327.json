    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume.\nSpeaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment. \nSpeaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A finds fulfillment in volunteer work, currently working on painting projects and interested in trying lotus origami. They offered to teach Speaker B origami soon. \nSpeaker A enjoys art, specifically painting, while Speaker B enjoys traveling and visiting gardens. Speaker B keeps a turquoise lotus origami on their desk from Japan. \nSpeaker B enjoys running and singing, as well as traveling and visiting gardens. Speaker A wants to try making lotus origami next after successfully making a Lotus flower.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I think it's a mix of both! Some origami designs are simpler than they appear, while others can be quite challenging. But with practice and patience, anyone can learn to create beautiful origami pieces.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but does not fully connect or develop the speakers' interactions in a natural and detailed way. The information that Speaker A offered to teach origami to Speaker B is somewhat relevant, as it aligns with Speaker B's interest in learning origami. However, the MEMORY does not explicitly mention the origami contest mentioned in the context, which could helpfully bridge the past interactions with the current dialogue topic. Additionally, the MEMORY has redundant mentions of Speaker B's interests that don't directly serve the context's development. While some connections can be made, the MEMORY lacks a clear and effective narrative or development of their past interactions related to the origami discussion. A higher score would require a more cohesive narrative and better focus on the elements directly influencing the current dialogue."
