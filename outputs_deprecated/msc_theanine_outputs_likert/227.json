Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself!\nSpeaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food?\nSpeaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too?\nSpeaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also?\nSpeaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways?\nSpeaker B: They've been better as I left my previous job so I'm spending more time with them, how do you manage to work full time and still keep those animals happy?\nSpeaker A: I think working at the zoo so long has helped. Why did you leave your last job. Was that the one you were working in the warehouse? Sorry to hear about your dogs, it can be hard managing older animals.\nSpeaker B: Yea, that totally makes sense! I just wanted time off to spend with the dogs and look for a better job elsewhere, I'm hoping that I'll be able to get a job outside of a warehouse!\nSpeaker A: That is understandable. I didn't always think I would end up a zookeeper. Do you have anything in mind?\nSpeaker B: Well, I really enjoy animals so I might think of applying to work in a zoo aswell! Is it a super busy job?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has two terrier dogs as pets. Speaker A has penguins at the zoo and enjoys working with animals, offering Speaker B a chance to help out. Speaker A works at a zoo and is willing to help Speaker B get an entry-level position there. \n\nSpeaker A does not play music for the animals at the zoo to keep them calm. Speaker A has penguins at the zoo and enjoys working with animals, offering Speaker B a chance to help out. Speaker B is looking for a new job and is excited about the opportunity at the zoo. Speaker B has elderly terriers and is planning to leave their part-time job for a break before starting a new one. \n\nSpeaker A works as a zookeeper and loves animals, especially white tigers. Speaker A has penguins at the zoo and enjoys working with animals, offering Speaker B a chance to help out. Speaker A and Speaker B share a love for music and plan to have a house concert with their pets.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Working at the zoo can definitely be busy, but it's also incredibly rewarding. I'll keep you posted if any positions open up that you might be interested in!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that can be connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, it mentions Speaker B's two terrier dogs and their interest in working with animals, aligning with the dialogue about Speaker B wanting to find a job outside of the warehouse, potentially at a zoo. Similarly, the MEMORY notes Speaker A's work at a zoo and enjoyment of working with animals, which matches the dialogue mentioning Speaker A's current job and its influence. However, there are redundant sentences, such as the repeated mention of Speaker A enjoying working with animals and having penguins at the zoo. While the MEMORY does not disrupt the dialogue context, it could be more concise and directly relevant to the ongoing conversation, which limits the overall helpfulness to a moderate level."
