Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company? Do you build computers or work on programming?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys reading books about ice cream, Disney World, and computers, which causes Speaker A to be open to meeting for lunch and flexible with food choices. Speaker B works for a computer company and is unable to change careers until their child graduates. This makes Speaker B want to speak to their mother, who is a dentist with her own practice. Speaker A, who works for a small local business with a demanding schedule, is hindered by this schedule but remains open to meeting for lunch and flexible with food choices.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information about Speaker A and Speaker B, but it lacks clarity and relevance with respect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The mention of Speaker B working for a computer company is relevant to the context provided, as Speaker B is asked about their role at such a company. However, the MEMORY doesn't elaborate on Speaker B's job role, which would be directly helpful for generating a response. The additional details about Speaker A's interests, work schedule, and flexibility with food choices are not particularly relevant to the current dialogue, which focuses on Speaker B's job. Furthermore, the MEMORY does not clearly establish any past interactions or development between the speakers that are relevant to the current conversation. The sentences are not well-connected to demonstrate causality or relevance to the dialogue's context."
