Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast.\nSpeaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project.\nSpeaker A: Quite a few, but it wasn't too crowded. It was a nice change of scenery. What kind of project are you working on?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is a college student who teaches jiu-jitsu, is lactose intolerant, and is enrolled in a class on the history of martial arts while majoring in athletic training. Both Speaker A and Speaker B are interested in martial arts and enjoy learning new things. Speaker A is planning to take summer courses soon and is very active, enjoying martial arts, while Speaker B is busy debugging software and is a runner. Speaker A and Speaker B have not booked any holidays recently.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it confirms that both speakers share an interest in martial arts, which is relevant to the context where Speaker A talks about attending a martial arts class. Additionally, it mentions Speaker B's occupation related to software debugging, which aligns with Speaker B's current activity of working on a project. However, the MEMORY could be more specific about previous interactions or shared experiences, to make the connection and relevancy clearer and to enhance the potential response. Some parts of the MEMORY, such as details about Speaker A being lactose intolerant or their summer course plans, are not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, and do not enhance the ability to generate a better response. Nonetheless, the MEMORY contains naturally phrased information that allows a language model to differentiate relevant from non-relevant context cues."
