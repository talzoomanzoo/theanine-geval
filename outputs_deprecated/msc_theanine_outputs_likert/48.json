Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys being a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs, and also mentions the ups and downs of the profession. Speaker B is concerned about the cost of owning horses, including medical fees and expenses like horse shoes. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories. \nSpeaker B offers to talk about the absence of Speaker A's mother and suggests lying down on their couch, while mentioning the ups and downs of being a therapist. Speaker B lives in the city and is interested in having a horse in the future. \nSpeaker A is involved in horse breeding and taking care of horses, works at a stable, and enjoys being around horses. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B could pay a fee to a ranch to take care of a horse.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Therapy can definitely be helpful in processing past experiences. It's great that you find solace in riding your horses though, there's something special about that bond.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes details about Speaker B's enjoyment of being a therapist and mentions of the ups and downs of the profession, which align with the ongoing conversation where Speaker B discusses their love for their job despite challenges. Additionally, Speaker B's concern about the cost of owning horses connects to the context where Speaker A mentions finding therapy in riding horses, although it's more about Speaker B's perspective on horses rather than directly related to Speaker A's experiences. However, some parts of the memory (e.g., Speaker B being a football fan and considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse) are not directly relevant to the current context. The memory contains information about Speaker A's involvement with horses and a potential suggestion for Speaker B regarding horse care, which adds context but isn't directly tied to the therapy discussion. The memory can be reorganized to better highlight connections and development between speakers to improve its usefulness further."
