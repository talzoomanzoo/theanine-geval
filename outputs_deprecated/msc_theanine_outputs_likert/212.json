Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships!\nSpeaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!   I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field?\nSpeaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate?\nSpeaker B: I have another year- so this year is really important I get internships and start making connections in the field.   I love going to the beach too.  What happened with your knees that now cause you so much pain?\nSpeaker A: I think age has really been my knees downfall. I also used to hike a lot and I put a lot of pressure on my legs. That is great that you only have a year. Maybe when you graduate you can come hang out on the beach with me. I can't surf but I would love to watch you.\nSpeaker B: That would be fun!  I like collecting shells too so we could do that as well.  I have a small collection of ones I have from around the world.  The farthest away was from Greece.  Have you traveled a lot?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A used to surf when they were younger and is trying to get back into it. Speaker B is currently not good at surfing but is interested in sports medicine and enjoys surfing. \nSpeaker B is a college student studying sports medicine, playing soccer with other students, and looking to join their college team in the future. Speaker B's professors have been supportive in writing letters for an internship application. Speaker A is offering advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field. \nSpeaker A enjoys hiking along the coast, collecting shells, and mentions that their knees can't handle much else.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I haven't traveled as much as I would have liked to, but I have a few trips under my belt. Greece sounds amazing, I bet the shells there are beautiful!",
    "prediction": "3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker B's interest in sports medicine and their internship hunt, which relates to the conversation about internships. It also references Speaker A's enjoyment of coastal activities and issues with their knees, which aligns with the discussion about visiting the beach. However, it includes details that are not entirely relevant or present in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A trying to get back into surfing and Speaker B playing soccer. The connection and development of these points could be more naturally integrated and focused on the central themes of the dialogue."
