Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens?\nSpeaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month\nSpeaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.  Where are you going on vacation?\nSpeaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B discuss hobbies and interests, with Speaker A enjoying gardening and reading, and Speaker B enjoying visiting the zoo. Speaker B's girlfriend enjoys pandas and penguins at the zoo, and they go to the zoo every few weeks. Speaker B's girlfriend has a cockatoo that makes a lot of noise. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend.\n\nSpeaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo. Speaker B's girlfriend enjoys pandas and penguins at the zoo, and they go to the zoo every few weeks. Speaker B's girlfriend has a cockatoo that makes a lot of noise. Speaker A prefers cockatoos over kittens as pets.\n\nSpeaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo. Speaker B's girlfriend enjoys pandas and penguins at the zoo, and they go to the zoo every few weeks. Speaker A's sister is a dog person with a yellow lab. Speaker B is open to being a cool uncle to his sister's future children but does not want kids of his own.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "San Diego Zoo is amazing! You'll have a great time there.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information in relation to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It successfully outlines Speaker B's enjoyment of visiting the zoo, which aligns with Speaker B's excitement about going to the San Diego Zoo. Furthermore, it offers context about Speaker B's existing pets, such as the potential adoption of a kitten, which is directly linked to the initial discussion about adopting a kitten. However, there are some repetitively structured sentences that may slightly hinder the clarity regarding the development of events. Regardless, the overall connections between topics in the MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT are strong and beneficial for generating responses. Thus, a score of 4 is appropriate."
