Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \nSpeaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!).\nSpeaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol\nSpeaker B: I am up for the challenge! I have a few tricks up my sleeve to deal with people like you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A, originally from Venice Beach, is a runner focusing on improving their mile time and training for a marathon. This training has led Speaker A to seek advice on recovery and invite Speaker B to run and train together for the Alps marathon at 0600 on the beach.\n   \n2. Speaker B, who travels often for work and misses their family, wants to combine their motivational speaking with running, just like Speaker A. Speaker B also mentioned a humorous idea of fishing while feeling down and taking kids to the pond during school hours.\n\n3. Speaker A, despite disliking travel, has visited 20 countries and is seeking advice on recovering from marathon training. They also recommended to Speaker B to incorporate physical activity with moments of feeling low to avoid negative thoughts.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Looking forward to seeing those tricks in action. Hopefully, they involve some motivation to get out in the heat!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memory highlights Speaker A's identity as a runner and their focus on improving their mile time while training for a marathon. It also mentions Speaker B's aspiration to combine motivational speaking with running, aligning well with Speaker B’s recent success as a motivational speaker in the context.\n\nThe information about Speaker A seeking advice on recovery and inviting Speaker B to train together is particularly pertinent to the dialogue context, where Speaker A is looking to be motivated to encourage their friend to run. It could be useful for Speaker A to acknowledge in response to Speaker B's motivational note and their tricks for dealing with people like Speaker A.\n\nHowever, some details, such as Speaker B's humorous fishing idea or Speaker A's dislike for travel despite visiting many countries, may not directly influence the current conversation. Yet, these details are structured naturally and do not obscure the relevant parts of the memory about running and motivation.\n\nTherefore, the memory is quite helpful, though it’s not entirely focused; hence the score of 4."
