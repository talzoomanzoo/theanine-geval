Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her?\nSpeaker B: Hi there, hope you are wlll and managing to save up for your Italy trip?  Thank for asking about the Greek mythology study, we are doing very well. It helps because i am so passionate about it and hope to get to the Greek islands soon\nSpeaker A: Yes I have been saving up for another trip to Italy! I can't wait. It's planned for next Spring. Do you have any plans to go back to Italy in the future?\nSpeaker B: I would love to get back to Italy but need to save up and the hopeful priority is to Greece this year.  You have friends in Europe are you in contact to see what plans you can make?\nSpeaker A: Yes I've been talking to them quite a bit so they know what's going on. I'll be staying with some of them while I'm over there. I have never been to Greece....I'd like to go though. Maybe I'll add it to my itinerary! Maybe we could plan to be in Greece at the same time?!\nSpeaker B: That would be so good.  There is so much history and the roman statues i take my daughter to see in the museums and through our local resources is fab.  She is building up the passion which is lovely to see.  Have you still got your hair blue or has it grown out now?\nSpeaker A: That's awesome! Maybe you can teach me a little about all the mythology. I think I've never liked it before only because I didn't understand it. My hair is back to being its natural brown - lol I'm being boring for the moment.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has been to Italy in the past and enjoyed the food there, while Speaker A is fascinated by the architecture of Italy and enjoys studying history, especially through reading and watching documentaries. \nSpeaker A is planning for a spring break trip and recently bought a dress for Easter, and Speaker B does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology. Speaker B enjoys Greek mythology and did a case study on Poseidon, the God of the Sea, Earthquakes, and Horses. \nSpeaker A is planning for a spring break trip and recently bought a dress for Easter, and Speaker B does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology. Speaker B appreciates the idea of superhuman powers and is interested in historical events that involve such figures.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear about your plans and your natural hair color! I'm sure you'll enjoy Greece with its rich history and mythology. Maybe we can exchange some Greek mythology stories before your trip.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful background information related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT, with a strong focus on Speaker B's interest in Greek mythology and Speaker A's trip planning. The MEMORY does a good job of highlighting Speaker B's enthusiasm for Greek mythology and details about their previous visit to Italy, which connects with the dialogue about potential travel plans to Greece. Additionally, it mentions Speaker A's interest in history, which aligns with their discussions about travel and studying history through documentaries.\n\nHowever, there is some irrelevant content. For instance, details about Speaker A recently buying a dress for Easter are repeated and unrelated to the current discussion on travel and mythology. Despite this, the MEMORY is generally well-structured, providing useful insights that can guide the generation of appropriate responses and maintaining a coherent context for the shared interests between the speakers."
