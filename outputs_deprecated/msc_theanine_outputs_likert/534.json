Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies!\nSpeaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?  \nSpeaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere!\nSpeaker B: You have a point.  It is nice to see puppies wagging their tail and just following you!  Changing topics, do you have any recipes with asparagus?  You know, it's such a popular vegetable, but I just don't know how to prepare it.\nSpeaker A: I don't have recipes but I know how to make a good grilled asparagus. Are you looking to bolster your chef book?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B used to foster puppies but no longer does, while Speaker A is busy with work. Speaker A enjoys cooking, especially making fajitas, and also volunteers at animal shelters. \nSpeaker A is more interested in science than music, while Speaker B enjoys listening to Black Sabbath and grilling meat. They are excited about the idea of traveling the world and trying different cuisines, with Speaker A suggesting grilled asparagus with lemon. \nSpeaker A is an inventor working on a time machine and enjoys teleporting around the world. Speaker B is interested in trying different careers and is considering becoming a chef for Speaker A, who loves Mexican food and seafood. Speaker B is working on a project to build their resume and is unsure about the type of work they want to do.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, Speaker A's involvement with animal shelters connects to the discussion about the cat and puppies, indicating that Speaker A has experience with pets. This background can help inform the language model about ongoing interests related to animals. Additionally, Speaker A's cooking interest aligns with the question about recipes with asparagus. Although the MEMORY mentions fajitas instead of recipes related to asparagus, it does indicate Speaker A's general interest in cooking, potentially aiding the response to a question about preparing food. \n\nHowever, the rest of the MEMORY includes information not directly related or beneficial to the immediate dialogue context. For example, details about Speaker B fostering puppies, their interest in Black Sabbath, the idea of traveling the world, and Speaker A's scientific interests don't provide direct contextual cues for the present conversation about vegetables. While these points are naturally phrased, they are not immediately necessary for addressing Speaker B's questions. Thus, MEMORY offers some relevant information but contains other content that doesn't contribute to the immediate dialogue's content in meaningful ways, warranting a middle-ground score."
