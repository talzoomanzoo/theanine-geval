Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play? \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is skilled in writing and is part of a band where they play the drums and write music, with 4 members including the singer who is their best friend. This band tours different countries for their music, having visited Italy, Uzbekistan, and smaller countries in Central and South America.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "I play the guitar. How about you, what instrument do you play in the band?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY is highly relevant and helpful for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context asks what instrument Speaker A plays, and the MEMORY clearly states that Speaker A plays the drums, which directly answers the question. Additionally, the MEMORY provides valuable information about Speaker A's musical involvement, such as their role in a band, their involvement in writing music, the band's international tours, and their connection with the singer, who is their best friend. This information is naturally structured and gives a comprehensive understanding of Speaker A's musical background, which can aid in generating a relevant and contextually enriched response."
