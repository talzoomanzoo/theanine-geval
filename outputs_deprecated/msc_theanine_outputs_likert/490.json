Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for.\nSpeaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for?\nSpeaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\nSpeaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise? \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs. Speaker A plans to potentially visit the Columbia Trail and Ken Lockwood Gorge for a camping and hiking trip. Speaker A and Speaker B have gone hiking together before and plan to meet up for another hike. Speaker B is not in the best hiking shape and jokes about needing to recharge their energy.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY contains a mix of relevant and irrelevant information in relation to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Some elements are quite helpful, as they provide background on the relationship between the speakers and the context of their interactions. For example, the information that Speaker A and Speaker B have gone hiking together before connects to the dialogue's casual and friendly tone, possibly setting the stage for the conversation's nature. The fact that Speaker B is not in the best hiking shape and jokes about needing energy could be helpful when Speaker B talks about side projects and using humor in the conversation.\n\nHowever, much of the memory—such as Speaker A's potential travel plans and being a recent high school graduate—does not directly relate to the subjects being discussed in the dialogue (job offers and career choices). The information is naturally structured and gives useful context to some degree, but not directly useful in generating the next response to Speaker A's question about Speaker B's career interests."
