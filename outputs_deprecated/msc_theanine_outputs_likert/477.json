Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \nSpeaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!).\nSpeaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A wants to seek advice on how to recover from marathon training, so Speaker B, who has run a marathon before, offers guidance. Speaker A then invites Speaker B to train together for the Alps marathon. \nSpeaker B, a motivational speaker who travels to give pep talks, joked about combining fishing with feeling depressed. \nSpeaker A, who sprained their ankle while training for marathons, now has a healing ankle injury.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information that can be relevant to supporting the generation of a proper next response. It mentions that Speaker B is a motivational speaker who has run a marathon, which can be connected to Speaker B's current role and their speech's impact mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, MEMORY also includes a prior context of Speaker A inquiring about marathon recovery and training, which is somewhat relevant since Speaker A is potentially looking for motivation to train. However, the MEMORY also includes details like the joke about fishing and depression, which does not directly relate or connect well with the dialogue context. Furthermore, information about Speaker A's ankle injury, although related to running, does not directly contribute to the conversation happening in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT around motivation. Overall, the MEMORY provides some relevant background but lacks a clear and natural connection to fully align with the ongoing conversation, reducing its helpfulness."
