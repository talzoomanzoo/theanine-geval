Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\nSpeaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car?\nSpeaker B: Yes, there are several. Hope we could meet and You possibly teach me about computer programming.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Speaker A offering to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming because Speaker A knows how to swim since the age of 5.\n- Speaker A planning to travel to the Caribbean for their next trip because Speaker B enjoys cruising in their car while listening to punk music.\n- Speaker A planning to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination because Speaker A knows how to swim since the age of 5.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a plan! I can definitely help you with computer programming as well during our meetup this weekend.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is not structured optimally for generating a coherent response. The MEMORY mentions Speaker A offering to teach Speaker B how to swim, which aligns with the dialogue about swimming lessons. Also, Speaker A's plans to travel to the Caribbean for snorkeling are mentioned, which is relevant to their conversation about cruising. However, there's a discrepancy in the memory mentioning Speaker B enjoying cruising in their car while listening to punk music, which was not part of the dialogue. Additionally, some sentences lack clear connections or causality, such as knowing how to swim since age 5 being included twice and not directly linked to the current dialogue. Therefore, while MEMORY has relevant parts, some areas could be phrased or connected better for clarity and context development."
