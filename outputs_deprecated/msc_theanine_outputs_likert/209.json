    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships!\nSpeaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!   I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field?\nSpeaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, as the only child of Speaker B's mother who runs a local high school, is studying sports medicine and plays soccer, aiming to join their college team in the future. Speaker A, offering advice and encouragement to Speaker B on the internship hunt, brings up the medical field. Speaker A used to surf when they were younger, contrasting with Speaker B's current lack of skill in surfing. However, Speaker A is trying to get back into surfing. Speaker B, a college student who plays soccer with peers, is now seeking internships in sports medicine and has approached professors for recommendation letters. Additionally, Speaker B is training for soccer and aspires to make the school team as a walk-on player.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I have about a year left before I graduate. I'm excited to see where my internship opportunities will take me in the sports medicine field.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a significant amount of helpful information that can aid Speaker B, a language model, in generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures crucial elements of Speaker B's background, such as studying sports medicine, playing soccer, and seeking internships. This context aligns well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Speaker A discusses an internship opportunity related to sports and the medical field. Additionally, MEMORY includes other details like Speaker A's past and current interests in surfing, providing richer context even if not directly relevant to the immediate conversation. The only potential gap is that the MEMORY doesn't explicitly mention the previous instance of Speaker A offering internship advice; otherwise, the connections are naturally integrated, and the content is beneficial for creating a coherent continuation of the dialogue."
