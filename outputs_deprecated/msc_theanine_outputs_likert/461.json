Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue.\nSpeaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad.\nSpeaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs!\nSpeaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours?\nSpeaker A: Ikea! Their furniture is not to expensive and they have all kinds of furniture that'll go with whatever scheme you're going for. What kind of patio furniture were you looking for? Like a barbeque, chairs, hammock? \nSpeaker B: I guess I was going to get like an umbrella table and some chairs to go with it or maybe even a screened in gazebo with a fire pit in the middle.\nSpeaker A: That's a great idea! Sounds like a very nice place for a barbeque. What were you planning on grilling for the barbeque? \nSpeaker B: I'll get the steaks to grill if you will bring the corn. And I have a request for you to play on the guitar, I know you are into country so if you could maybe play a song or two by Miranda Lambert, that would be awesome.\nSpeaker A: Of course! I love Miranda Lambert, any specific song requests? \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both acknowledge their lack of expertise in interior decorating. They plan to meet up to discuss the furniture exchange and enjoy a night with music, food, and company. Speaker A invites Speaker B over for this purpose. \n\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both enjoy barbecuing and have a love for pets. Speaker B plans to grill steaks this weekend using an old charcoal grill. Speaker A is looking forward to spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights.\n\nSpeaker B plans to grill steaks this weekend using an old charcoal grill. They suggest making enough barbeque for leftovers on nights when grilling is not possible, due to time or energy constraints.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "How about \"The House That Built Me\" and \"White Liar\"? I think those would be great choices for the barbecue.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY does contain some information that is slightly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the mention of grilling steaks, which ties to Speaker B's plan in the dialogue. However, most of the MEMORY provides information that is too broad and does not specifically align with the detailed exchanges in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as specific furniture plans, color scheme ideas, or specific music requests. The MEMORY lacks the causal or developmental connections needed to provide a cohesive background that directly supports generating a response based on the given context. Additionally, information about pets and quiet evenings is not relevant to the current conversation, though it is clear and contextual enough for a model to discern it as non-beneficial. Overall, the MEMORY provides limited helpful information that is directly applicable to the ongoing dialogue."
