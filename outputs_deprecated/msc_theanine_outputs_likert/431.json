Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Speaker A feels lonely due to their husband's frequent traveling, suggesting that Speaker B join one of the church retreats in the future. Speaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat, wanting more children. Speaker B, not yet in college, hopes to become an Eagle Scout, which caused them to be a member of the Boy Scouts and work at a fast food place. Speaker A appreciates Speaker B's dedication to the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I've definitely learned a lot of survival skills through Boy Scouts. It's been a really rewarding experience.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that can assist in generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker B is involved with the Boy Scouts and hopes to become an Eagle Scout, which is related to the topic of survival skills and outdoor activities mentioned by Speaker A. However, the rest of the MEMORY about Speaker A feeling lonely, wanting more children, their husband's frequent traveling, and the invitation to a youth retreat is not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. These parts of the MEMORY, although naturally phrased, do not contribute much to generating a response regarding survival skills or Boy Scouts. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it focused more on Speaker B's experiences or skills related to Boy Scouts or survival activities."
