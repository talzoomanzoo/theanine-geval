Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume.\nSpeaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment. \nSpeaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think?\nSpeaker A: It depends on what you are trying to make out of origami, you can make some super complicated stuff, there's actually special paper that you can get for it! You may have seen origami be used in the hospital for some breathing aperatus!\nSpeaker B: That's amazing. I had no idea, but that totally makes sense. Do you have to practice a lot -- sort of a use it or lose it kind of thing?\nSpeaker A: Yea, I think for the more complicated origami it's kind of a use it or lose it but for the simple stuff you can usually take a couple months of and still remember to do it! Did you see origami in Japan?\nSpeaker B: Not up close, but I noticed a lot in shop windows in certain areas. I love Japan -- they're so welcoming. One of our acquaintances GAVE me a kimono. She said it's customary to try to share their culture. Kind of different from America in my opinion.  \nSpeaker A: Oh, that sounds wonderful. It's impressive how much things that came from there and how giving a culture they are. America is definetly a lot different from them, have you visted different states in America?\nSpeaker B: Oh yes. I live in North Carolina, but I've been to almost every state. Alaska was by far my favorite, but I'm kind of a loner and it feels like a lot of people there are, so maybe I just relate. But the scenery and landscapes are unbelievably beautiful. What's your favorite place you've been to?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A finds meaning and fulfillment in doing volunteer work. This has led Speaker A to work on painting projects in their craft room. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next and wishes to visit the country where origami was originally created, possibly Japan.\n\nSpeaker B has visited 20 countries and enjoys the color turquoise. This love for traveling and visiting gardens has led Speaker B to be recommended volunteering by Speaker A. Speaker B has traveled to Japan and Italy, enjoying the art and food, and found Japan to be an amazing country.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "My favorite place I've been to would have to be Italy. The history, art, and food were just incredible. I'd love to go back someday.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant context for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly regarding Speaker A's interest in origami and potential plans to visit Japan, as well as Speaker B's travels to Japan, which aligns with their mention of experiencing origami in shop windows and discussing cultural differences between Japan and America. However, most of the other details in the MEMORY, such as Speaker A's volunteer work or painting projects, and Speaker B's favorite color or garden visits, do not directly contribute to the current conversation. The connection and development between past and present interactions are partially demonstrated, but not in a fully comprehensive manner that greatly enhances the language model's ability to generate contextually rich responses."
