Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \nSpeaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with?\nSpeaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B lives in a rural area with a farm and can relate to cooking. Speaker B's husband is a great cook and enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work. \nSpeaker B lives in a rural area with a farm and can relate to cooking. Speaker A is interested in running a business with their cooking skills. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker. \nSpeaker B lives in a rural area with a farm and can relate to cooking. Speaker B also mentions having a farm with animals like chickens, ducks, pigs, goats, and growing crops like corn, strawberries, and pumpkins. Speaker A owns a farm and enjoys cooking and baking. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "Yes, shrimp fried rice typically includes eggs. That's perfect since you have your own fresh eggs from your farm. It's great to use ingredients you already have on hand.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains information about Speaker B's living situation, interest in cooking, and her husband's cooking abilities, which contribute to character development and can be somewhat helpful. This information is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where the conversation is about cooking and trying new recipes, particularly with a pressure cooker. The mention of Speaker B growing her own eggs and having a farm is useful since it connects directly to her interest in the shrimp fried rice recipe. However, the repetition of Speaker B living in a rural area and having a farm is redundant, and some information about Speaker A's business interest is not directly relevant to the current context. The MEMORY lacks smooth transitions and causality between all the events mentioned, reducing its helpfulness. Overall, it provides some helpful context but could be more concise and connected."
