Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast.\nSpeaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project.\nSpeaker A: Quite a few, but it wasn't too crowded. It was a nice change of scenery. What kind of project are you working on?\nSpeaker B: I'm sure the student appreciate that. You teach as a group as apposed to one-on-one right? And one of the companies I work for had their system hit with a virus so I've been upgraded their software to debug the system.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is planning to take summer courses soon and is very active, enjoying martial arts. Speaker A is enrolled in a class on the history of martial arts and is majoring in athletic training. Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class and enjoys it. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts.\nSpeaker A is a college student who teaches jiu-jitsu and is lactose intolerant. Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class and enjoys it. Both Speaker A and Speaker B are interested in martial arts and enjoy learning new things.\nSpeaker A is planning to take summer courses soon and is very active, enjoying martial arts. Speaker A has never been out of the United States and thinks it would be nice to visit England. Speaker A and Speaker B have not booked any holidays recently.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Teaching in a group setting allows for more interaction among students. Upgrading software can be time-consuming, but it's rewarding once everything runs smoothly.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some helpful information that could be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It reinforces Speaker A's active involvement and enjoyment in martial arts, as mentioned in the conversation about attending martial arts classes. Additionally, it identifies Speaker A as a jiu-jitsu teacher, which aligns with Speaker B's question about teaching in groups. However, the MEMORY also contains repetitive and less relevant information, such as Speaker A's interest in visiting England and their lactose intolerance, which do not connect to the current dialogue context. The connection between Speaker B's work in software and their interest in martial arts, mentioned in MEMORY, could be considered tangentially related to the conversation about project work, but it is not directly helpful in shaping the ongoing dialogue. Overall, while there is some relevant information, the MEMORY could be more effectively organized and concise."
