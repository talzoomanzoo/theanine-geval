Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go?\nSpeaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is on their way to college and studying sports medicine, which is causing them to get all A's in the sports medicine class. This pressure stems from the need to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n   \n2. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject, leading them to feel pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n   \n3. Speaker B is on their way to college and studying sports medicine, while Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring. Both are dealing with different academic pressures and feelings of being overwhelmed.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that Speaker B is studying sports medicine, which may cause academic pressures due to the need to maintain straight Aâ€™s potentially to avoid embarrassment in front of their mother, which is relevant to Speaker B's mention of upcoming finals. This might provide context for generating an empathetic response from Speaker A. However, the MEMORY lacks detailed connections or developments of interactions between the two speakers, and it does not link directly to the specifics of the current dialogue about exams in different subjects (e.g., history and other upcoming exams). The sentences are clear but not necessarily structured in a way that conveys the evolution of interactions directly related to the dialogue."
