Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on!\nSpeaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A learned how to make jello from their grandma, turning it into a family tradition. Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes.\nSpeaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\nSpeaker A learned how to make jello from their grandma, turning it into a family tradition. Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "Maybe you could try a sugar-free version of the jello recipe to make it a bit healthier for you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information that is somewhat helpful for generating a proper next response. It provides context about Speaker A's experience with jello recipes, specifically mentioning their grandmother as a significant influence. This information establishes a parallel connection with Speaker B's situation of sharing a family tradition with their kids. However, the MEMORY has repetition and does not explicitly highlight connections or developments in past interactions between the speakers, which limits its helpfulness. Additionally, the MEMORY doesn't mention anything directly about Speaker B's plan to lay off sugar, a detail present in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, the MEMORY could benefit from more varied and specific content to better support the generation of responses relevant to the entire context."
