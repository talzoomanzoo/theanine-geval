Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me?\nSpeaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week?\nSpeaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day\nSpeaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through\nSpeaker A: Actually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has blue eyes and blonde hair, while Speaker B is balding and overweight. Speaker A plans to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit. Speaker A drives a smart car and used to have a long commute in Alaska. Speaker A has visited Alaska and describes it as beautiful, suggesting cheap flights to Anchorage. Speaker A's family is from the north, and they prefer the warmth of the south. Speaker B found flights that work for their schedule and price and will be visiting Speaker A in a couple of weeks.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a good amount of helpful information for generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It indicates a positive development in Speaker B's travel plans, stating that flight tickets have been found, which aligns well with the ongoing conversation about planning a visit. It notes that the visit involves touring and attending folk concerts, which directly ties into the discussion of planning around concerts. While the MEMORY includes some additional details that are not highly relevant to the conversation (e.g., descriptions of visual appearances, Speaker A's car and commute background, and family preferences for warmer climates), these details are naturally phrased and do not overshadow the main helpful aspects. Overall, the MEMORY effectively supports understanding the context and next steps in the dialog."
