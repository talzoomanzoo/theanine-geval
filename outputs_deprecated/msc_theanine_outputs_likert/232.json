    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet? \nSpeaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name?\nSpeaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \nSpeaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, who lives in the city they grew up in and loves animals, has a cat that recently had a kitten, which caused them to have two sick kitties and recently receive a rescue. This situation led Speaker A, who has a parrot named Tasha, to be interested in adopting a rescue kitten. \nSpeaker B, who lives in the city they grew up in and loves animals, has a cat that recently had a kitten, which caused them to have two sick kitties and recently receive a rescue. This led Speaker B to have 3 cats, two of which are sick, and look for someone to adopt one of them, which made Speaker A interested in training tips for the kittens and open to adopting one despite having a parrot. \nSpeaker A, who has a pet parrot named Tasha and has red hair that makes them stand out, has a pet named Tasha who speaks Mandarin, and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've been doing some research on introducing cats to birds. It seems like a slow and careful introduction process is key to help them get along.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a general context about both speakers and their pets, which is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY mentions Speaker B's love for animals, ownership of cats, and intention to find a home for one of the kittens, which aligns with the conversation topic about kittens and adoption. Speaker A's interest in adopting a kitten despite having a parrot named Tasha is also noted, which connects to the current dialogue about adopting kittens.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY contains redundant information and lacks clarity in expressing the development of events. The repetition of information about Speaker B's cats and Speaker A's parrot without clear differentiation or efficient linkage to the current context makes it less helpful. The MEMORY does not provide direct information on the topics of kitten names or the specific concern about cats and parrots getting along, which are important cues in the dialogue context. Therefore, while the MEMORY is somewhat connected, it could be more concise and directly relevant to enhance its usefulness significantly."
