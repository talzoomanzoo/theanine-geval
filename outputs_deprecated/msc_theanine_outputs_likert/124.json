Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well?\nSpeaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes?\nSpeaker A: I want to take some martial art classes at school next year. What do you sggest I try?\nSpeaker B: I mean I always recommend Karate since that's what I study! I can bring you by the dojo sometime if you want to see what it is like. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, who currently works as a lifeguard and practices karate, is considering a career change to the IT sector due to their computer skills and the growing demand for employees in that field. This decision comes as working as a lifeguard is physically demanding and not seen as a suitable long-term career option.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That would be great! I'd love to check out the dojo and see what karate is all about.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some useful context about Speaker B's background in karate, which is relevant given the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where martial arts and karate are being discussed. However, the other details provided in the MEMORY about Speaker B's career as a lifeguard and potential switch to the IT sector do not contribute to generating a response relevant to the immediate context of discussing martial arts recommendations. The information about Speaker B's career decision lacks direct relevance to the conversation at hand and thus doesn't provide helpful contextual cues for generating the next response. The structured information about karate could aid in forming a response but is minimal compared to the unrelated details. As such, the MEMORY is partially helpful but not optimally leveraged regarding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
