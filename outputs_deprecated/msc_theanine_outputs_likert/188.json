    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make?\nSpeaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it.\nSpeaker A: I would love to, I enjoy cooking so maybe you can teach me to make it, too?\nSpeaker B: Yeah definitely! I know you like hot foods, so if you learn and can make them fresh it will taste amazing. Have you tried any new foods lately?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A finds cooking helpful for stress relief, while Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe.\nSpeaker A wakes up early in the morning to catch waves, while Speaker B likes to eat huge steaks after snowboarding.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information regarding Speaker B enjoying the grandmother's garlic chicken recipe, which ties into the current conversation about cooking and garlic chicken. However, most of the MEMORY is not particularly helpful in generating the next response for the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The other information, such as Speaker A waking up early for surfing or Speaker B's preference for steaks after snowboarding, does not contribute to the immediate conversation about sharing recipes and cooking spicy food. These details do not efficiently aid in creating a response that furthers the present dialogue about learning and enjoying cooking together. The MEMORY lacks enough connected and relevant information to rate it higher."
