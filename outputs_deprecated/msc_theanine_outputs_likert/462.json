Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue.\nSpeaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad.\nSpeaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs!\nSpeaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours?\nSpeaker A: Ikea! Their furniture is not to expensive and they have all kinds of furniture that'll go with whatever scheme you're going for. What kind of patio furniture were you looking for? Like a barbeque, chairs, hammock? \nSpeaker B: I guess I was going to get like an umbrella table and some chairs to go with it or maybe even a screened in gazebo with a fire pit in the middle.\nSpeaker A: That's a great idea! Sounds like a very nice place for a barbeque. What were you planning on grilling for the barbeque? \nSpeaker B: I'll get the steaks to grill if you will bring the corn. And I have a request for you to play on the guitar, I know you are into country so if you could maybe play a song or two by Miranda Lambert, that would be awesome.\nSpeaker A: Of course! I love Miranda Lambert, any specific song requests? \nSpeaker B: Nothing specific I love all her songs, I think I'm going get off here so I can try to order that gazebo.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is in the process of renovating their house to meet their living standards with their pets. Speaker B plans to grill steaks this weekend and prefers using an old charcoal grill over a gas one. Speaker A is looking forward to spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights.\n\nSpeaker B is looking for furniture shop to buy furniture, has two dogs, and works near a mall. Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing furniture and home decor choices. This discussion causes Speaker A and Speaker B to plan to meet up to discuss the furniture exchange. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both enjoy barbecuing and have a love for pets. They are discussing furniture and home decor choices, which leads to them planning to meet up to discuss the furniture exchange. Speaker A, who has devices to keep bugs away, offers to share the product names with Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Sounds good! I'll make sure to get some fresh corn for the barbecue. Enjoy ordering the gazebo!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context that might be helpful for generating a response, but it lacks coherence and relevance to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY includes information about Speaker B renovating their house and planning to use a charcoal grill, which aligns with the ongoing discussion about furniture and barbecues. However, there are several discrepancies and extraneous details that do not directly pertain to the dialogue, such as Speaker B working near a mall or Speaker A looking forward to spending quiet evenings outside, which aren't related to the current conversational context. Moreover, the mention of planning to meet up for a furniture exchange is not entirely accurate according to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT presented. Overall, while there are pieces of information that could be relevant, they are poorly structured, leading to a lack of helpfulness in connecting and developing the dialogue effectively."
