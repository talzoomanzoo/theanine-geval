Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college?\nSpeaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position. \nSpeaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it?\nSpeaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \nSpeaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living.\nSpeaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime?\nSpeaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A, a college student majoring in Humanities and not currently employed, used to work part-time at a supermarket. Now, Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n2. Speaker A, a college student majoring in Humanities and not currently employed, used to work part-time at a supermarket. Now, Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week. This has led to Speaker A scoring well in soccer recently.\n3. Speaker A, who enjoys playing soccer but is not into music, now plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week. This has resulted in Speaker A scoring well in soccer recently.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be helpful for generating a response in the context of this dialogue. Information about Speaker A's involvement in soccer (being a striker, playing in tournaments, and having an upcoming match) is relevant to the context since both speakers are discussing soccer and potentially playing together. However, the memory repeats certain details across the sentences (e.g., Speaker A is a college student majoring in Humanities and not employed) that do not provide any additional or useful context to the conversation about soccer. The memory could be more helpful if it offered more insights into past interactions or personal ties to Speaker B regarding soccer, rather than details that are not pertinent to the conversation's progression."
