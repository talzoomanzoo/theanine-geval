    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens?\nSpeaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month\nSpeaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.  Where are you going on vacation?\nSpeaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there!\nSpeaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo?\nSpeaker B: Their zoo is pretty good! It's always crowded, of course, but they have pandas so I'm happy. I would say it's bigger than the DC zoo, but I like that the DC zoo has fewer people.\nSpeaker A: That sounds awesome.  I haven't been to the zoo in so long.  I wish I could go.\nSpeaker B: You should go with your sister! she can bring her dog. They probably have all kinds of exotic birds...\nSpeaker A: That's a great idea!  I'm not sure how good her dog would do around other animals though.  She always barks like crazy whenever she sees any kind of animal.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A's sister recently got married, which was exciting for them. This event causes Speaker A to enjoy seeing pandas and penguins at the zoo and goes with their sister. Speaker A's sister is a dog person with a yellow lab, even though it changed to Speaker A has a sister who owns a corgi.\n\nSpeaker A and Speaker B discuss hobbies and interests, with Speaker A enjoying gardening and reading, and Speaker B enjoying visiting the zoo. Speaker B's girlfriend enjoys pandas and penguins at the zoo, and they go to the zoo every few weeks, which makes Speaker B want his girlfriend to have a cockatoo that makes a lot of noise. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend because his girlfriend has a cockatoo named John.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "Maybe your sister's dog just needs a little socialization. It could be a fun adventure for all of you!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information that could be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the fact that Speaker B enjoys visiting the zoo and is considering adopting a kitten. However, the structure and phrasing of the MEMORY passages are somewhat disjointed, making it difficult to fully grasp the development of past interactions between the speakers. Additionally, the mention of Speaker A's sister getting married and having a dog is only tangentially related to the conversation and does not contribute significantly to generating a future response. Overall, the MEMORY could be more helpful if it were better organized and more directly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
