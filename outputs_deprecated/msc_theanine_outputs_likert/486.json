Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A, a recent high school graduate on a cross-country journey, is looking for a job and new camping gear, specifically a hammock. This is because Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker A, a recent high school graduate on a cross-country journey, is looking for a job and new camping gear, specifically a hammock. This change occurred after Speaker A acquired a portable hammock for the hike and asked Speaker B to bring theirs.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great news! When do you start?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: MEMORY contains some relevant information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A looking for a job at a grocery store near a hiking trail, which aligns with the context of Speaker A being contacted for a job they had applied for at a grocery store. The mention of camping gear and a hammock adds context to Speaker A's situation and lifestyle but is not directly relevant to the job offer. The sentences are somewhat naturally structured, providing context about Speaker A's recent activities and journey, which can be useful for understanding Speaker A's current circumstances. However, the MEMORY could be more focused on the job application situation for enhanced relevance and helpfulness."
