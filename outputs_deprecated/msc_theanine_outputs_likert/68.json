Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play? \nSpeaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music.\nSpeaker A: ah right, who's your favourite rock band?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys rock music and wants to see Sublime live one day. They are part of a band that tours different countries for their music. Speaker A is good at writing and plays music, possibly a musician. Speaker A is in a band where they play the drums and write music, with 4 members including the singer who is their best friend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A's interest in rock music and involvement in a band. These details can help Speaker B generate a more informed response, potentially leading to a discussion about music preferences or experiences. However, certain elements of MEMORY, such as Speaker A's desire to see Sublime live or their role as a drummer in a band, are not directly related to the current dialogue about Speaker B's favorite rock band. These aspects could serve as additional context but do not have a direct impact on the ongoing conversation. Therefore, the MEMORY is informative but not entirely aligned with the immediate conversational flow."
