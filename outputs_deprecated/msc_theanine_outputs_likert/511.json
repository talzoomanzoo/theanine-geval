Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well?\nSpeaker B: The older one seems to like it while the youngest cannot be bothered. Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon?\nSpeaker A: Yes!  As a matter of fact, I'm visiting my son that lives in Spain next month.  This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now!\nSpeaker B: Oh nice. You must be looking forward to it. He must have told you a lot about her. Do you think you would like her?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has multiple sons, at least one of them is in a relationship with a Spanish girlfriend. Speaker A has two sons, one of whom has a girlfriend and the other is secretive and possibly gay. Speaker A has two sons who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next. Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe. Speaker B's younger son would be jealous of Speaker A's sons' European tour. Speaker B's sons would possibly get along well with Speaker A's sons.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker A having multiple sons, one of whom has a Spanish girlfriend, which connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A mentions visiting a son in Spain and meeting his girlfriend. This helps establish a helpful context for Speaker A's response. However, other details, such as one son being secretive, possibly gay, or details about European tours or studying abroad, do not directly contribute to generating a next response based on the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. These additional details could be confusing rather than aiding in generating the next response. The MEMORY lacks clear development or causality regarding the interactions between the two speakers that can be clearly aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT for a natural response generation."
