Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast.\nSpeaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project.\nSpeaker A: Quite a few, but it wasn't too crowded. It was a nice change of scenery. What kind of project are you working on?\nSpeaker B: I'm sure the student appreciate that. You teach as a group as apposed to one-on-one right? And one of the companies I work for had their system hit with a virus so I've been upgraded their software to debug the system.\nSpeaker A: I teach group classes and one on one, but I was the student today. I specialize in jiu-jitsu but today I got to be the student in a taekwondo class. \nSpeaker B: That's even better, learning is a life-long journey. How are you class on martial art history? When you have time teach me too, I'd love to learn. \nSpeaker A: It's been a little stressful lately, because finals are coming up...but I'm confident in that class. I could've aced it before I even started! I'll definitely get started with you after finals.\nSpeaker B: Ahaha we;; for someone who's so passionate about martial arts I'm not surprised. Great, I'll try to be the best student I can. I'm starving, think I should grab some take-out from Sufi?\nSpeaker A: Of course! It's your favorite after all! Now you made me hungry! lol\nSpeaker B: Sorry for the typos and correction there's a restaurant here similar to Sufi's in London. They sell delicious Donairs, you should definitely try them out sometime.\nSpeaker A: Thanks for letting me know! I'll have to check that out soon!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A, who is a college student teaching jiu-jitsu and is lactose intolerant, is now enrolled in a class on the history of martial arts and is majoring in athletic training. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts. \nSpeaker A, who is planning to take summer courses soon and is very active in martial arts, wants to visit England as they have never been out of the United States. Speaker B, who is from London, England and misses it, enjoys fancy restaurants and mentioned Sufi as their favorite in London.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Donairs are a must-try, especially if you enjoy Sufi's cuisine. Let me know how you like them when you get the chance!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information that is helpful in understanding the past interactions and context between Speaker A and Speaker B. It includes information about Speaker A's interest in martial arts, their current academic pursuits, and their desire to visit England, which ties back to the conversation about trying new foods and taking courses in martial arts history. Additionally, the MEMORY highlights Speaker B's background in software work and their recent enrollment in a martial arts history class, which is relevant to the ongoing discussion about learning and teaching martial arts. The connection between Speaker B's fondness for Sufi, which was mentioned in the dialogue, also shows a continuity in conversation topics. The MEMORY is structured in a way that provides the language model with necessary context to generate responses that align with these past interactions, though not every detail is directly applicable to the dialogue context provided. Nevertheless, it presents a cohesive and informative background narrative that could steer the conversation effectively."
