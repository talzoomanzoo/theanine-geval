Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well?\nSpeaker B: I haven't! Just karate!

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, primarily related to Speaker B's involvement in karate. For instance, it confirms that Speaker B practices karate and holds a green belt, which is helpful given the discussion about martial arts. Additionally, the mention of Speaker B's involvement in other activities and considering going back to school, although not directly related to the immediate dialogue, adds depth to their character. However, the repetition of certain pieces of information and the inclusion of details not directly pertinent to the conversation at hand (e.g., football background and school plans) reduces the overall focus and conciseness. For these reasons, while the memory adds some value, it could be more directly aligned with the specific context of the conversation. The overall structure of the memory can be said to loosely connect to the dialogue but lacks clear development or causality related to the immediate topic of martial arts classes."
