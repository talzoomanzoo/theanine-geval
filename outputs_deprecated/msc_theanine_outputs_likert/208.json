    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships!\nSpeaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!   I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is a college student who plays soccer with other students. This student is studying sports medicine and plays soccer, looking to join their college team in the future. Speaker A is offering advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field.\n\nSpeaker B's mother runs a local high school, and Speaker B is her only child. Speaker B has been going to the beach a lot and is learning to surf from friends in Jersey. Speaker A suggests that surfing could be a way for Speaker B to make connections in the medical field.\n\nSpeaker B is a college student who plays soccer with other students. This student is looking for internships in the sports medicine field and has asked professors for letters of recommendation. This action causes Speaker B's professors to be supportive in writing letters for an internship application. Speaker A is offering advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I work as a physical therapist, helping patients recover from injuries and improve their overall physical well-being. It's a rewarding field that combines my passion for sports and medicine.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some context for both speakers, particularly Speaker B's background and goals. It mentions that Speaker B is a college student studying sports medicine, plays soccer, and is searching for internships in the sports medicine field. This aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B is interested in an internship opportunity in the medical/athletic training field, which would help generate a relevant next response.\n\nHowever, several parts of the MEMORY are somewhat repetitive, redundant, or unrelated to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the information that Speaker B is learning to surf in Jersey or that B's mother runs a local high school. These elements do not directly contribute to the development of the main topic discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the information about professors writing letters for internships is somewhat tangential to the primary context of Speaker A providing an internship lead.\n\nOverall, while the MEMORY contains some useful information, it could be more focused and better structured to enhance its helpfulness for generating coherent and context-aware responses. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate."
