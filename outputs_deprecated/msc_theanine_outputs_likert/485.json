Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \nSpeaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!).\nSpeaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol\nSpeaker B: I am up for the challenge! I have a few tricks up my sleeve to deal with people like you.\nSpeaker A: Oh geez that makes me sound difficult.lol  Do you have any new speeches coming up?\nSpeaker B: Nope, I just cleared my schedule until the Alps marathon that you're training for. It's just you and me until you break that finish line. I'm going to start sending you a motivational quote every morning at 4 am when I want you to wake up.\nSpeaker A: Wow 4 am.  Is it too late to change my mind?lol\nSpeaker B: Yes. We have an iron-clad written agreement. Tell me how I'm doing so far. Is this the most motivated you've ever been in your entire life?\nSpeaker A: No, but that's why I have you.  You're going to push me to do the things I can't bring myself to do.  I'll have more motivation tomorrow.  Today was a long work day.lol\nSpeaker B: I'm going to try a new motivational technique with you. Would you be more frightened by a spider or a snake. I need to know before we meet up this weekend.\nSpeaker A: A spider no question but if you ask me to hold one I'm definitely running away.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, who is from San Francisco and enjoys fishing and the outdoors, has experience running a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding. Speaker A, on the other hand, is training for marathons and seeking advice on recovery. In response, Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and planning to meet at the beach at 0600.\n\nSpeaker B, known for being a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks, also joked about combining fishing with feeling depressed and mentioned taking young boys to the pond during school hours.\n\nAdditionally, Speaker B, who travels frequently for work and misses their wife and kids, found running a marathon tough yet rewarding. In a conversation with Speaker A, who is training for marathons and seeking advice on recovery, Speaker A suggested combining something more active with feeling depressed to avoid dwelling on negative thoughts.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'll make a note to leave the spiders at home then. We'll stick to motivating you in other ways.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful contextual information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is not particularly well-organized or concise. It informs us that Speaker B has experience in motivational speaking and has run a marathon before, which aligns with the current conversation about motivational techniques and training for a marathon. This detail helps to establish Speaker B's credibility and enthusiasm for coaching Speaker A. However, the MEMORY includes some information that is extraneous to the immediate context. For example, the mention of Speaker B taking young boys to the pond during school hours or jokes about combining fishing with feeling depressed, do not directly contribute to the ongoing dialogue. These additional details clutter the MEMORY without adding value to understanding the current dialogue. The MEMORY could be more succinct and focused on relevant past interactions to earn a higher score."
