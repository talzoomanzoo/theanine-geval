Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \nSpeaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!).\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B travels frequently for work and misses their wife and kids. This experience has made Speaker B empathize with Speaker A, who is a runner working on improving their mile time and training for a marathon. Speaker B, as a motivational speaker, understands the importance of staying motivated and focused on goals. \nSpeaker B, originally from San Francisco and enjoying fishing and the outdoors, got into motivational speaking to battle their own depression and anxiety. This personal journey led Speaker B to joke about combining fishing with feeling depressed, showing a unique perspective on managing emotions. \nSpeaker A, a runner who dislikes traveling but has visited 20 countries, is dedicated to improving their running performance. Speaker A recognizes the value of motivation in achieving success and dreams, which aligns with Speaker B's job as a motivational speaker. Speaker A even suggested a way for Speaker B to stay active and positive when feeling down.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's awesome to hear! Your passion for motivating others really shines through. I'll definitely keep you in mind for motivating my friend to start running again.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a fairly helpful context for generating a next response. It outlines Speaker B's experience as a motivational speaker and their empathy for Speaker A, who is training for a marathon. Speaker B's own journey with battling depression and anxiety through motivational speaking is highlighted, which is relevant to encouraging Speaker A. The memory also conveys a connection between the speakers, showing how Speaker A acknowledges the need for motivation in their own running journey—aligning with Speaker B’s expertise. The elements that describe Speaker A's and Speaker B's backgrounds (traveling, fishing, running) are mentioned in a way that connects to the dialogue, even if indirectly. However, some parts, such as the fishing aspect, may not directly relate to the immediate context of the dialogue, but they do contribute to the overall understanding of Speaker B's unique motivational strategy. Overall, most sentences contribute to providing a fuller understanding of the relationship and mindset of both speakers, enabling a language model to respond appropriately."
