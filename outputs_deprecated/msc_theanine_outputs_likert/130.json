Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well?\nSpeaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes?\nSpeaker A: I want to take some martial art classes at school next year. What do you sggest I try?\nSpeaker B: I mean I always recommend Karate since that's what I study! I can bring you by the dojo sometime if you want to see what it is like. \nSpeaker A: OMG!! That would be so awesome, Yes please.  When is a good time for you?\nSpeaker B: Awesome! Tomorrow afternoon anytime between 3-6 would work for me!\nSpeaker A: Perfect. I will meet you at the Dojo at 3pm. I really appriciate it, and I will buy you lunch after too. \nSpeaker B: That's great! I can bring some guest passes to the pool I lifeguard at as well! I'm working this weekend if you want to come when I am working. Where do you want to eat?\nSpeaker A: I defiantly will. As well a bucket of sunscreen, safety in the sun first.  I was thinking that new sandwhich shop by the collage that just opened, what do nyou think? \nSpeaker B: Oh yeah gotta bring that SPF 100! The new deli sounds great. I have been craving cold cuts! \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys studying marketing and foreign languages, hoping to create ads for movies in the future. Speaker B, who practices Karate and holds a green belt, is considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work. Additionally, Speaker B attends football games at their old high school and finds that their football background helps in karate footwork. Speaker B is also considering a career change to the IT sector due to their computer skills and the growing demand for employees in that sector. Lastly, Speaker B tans easily and takes precautions against sunburn and skin cancer due to the nature of their job, only using sunscreen on specific areas like the tops of their feet and face.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful background information about Speaker B which is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Speaker B is a karate practitioner, and this detail is relevant as it aligns with the current dialogue where Speaker A is showing interest in martial arts and planning to visit the dojo with Speaker B. Furthermore, the detail about Speaker B's karate experience adds depth to their recommendation of karate to Speaker A.\n\nAdditionally, Speaker B's discussions about offering guest passes to the pool align with the memory that notes Speaker B takes precautions against sunburn, although it doesn't directly enhance the dialogue. The information about taking precautions against sunburn is slightly connected to the end of the dialogue where sun safety is mentioned.\n\nHowever, many details in the MEMORY, such as Speaker A's interests in marketing and foreign languages, Speaker B considering a career change to the IT sector, and Speaker B's attendance at football games, do not directly influence this specific dialogue or aid in generating an immediate next response. While these provide character development, they are not immediately relevant to the conversation and hence do not enhance the immediate dialogue context significantly.\n\nOverall, while MEMORY has some relevant elements, several pieces of information do not add directly to the dialogue, resulting in a medium score for helpfulness."
