    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing?\nSpeaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals and discovered their love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets. They also think pit bulls are lovely and have one that is kind and sweet. Additionally, Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions. Speaker B's prices for a portrait start at $5000 to pay for college tuition, as they are an artist who did a painting for Elton John and has student debt from art school. Currently, Speaker B is working on other portraits and taking care of a sick dog.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a unique and fun portrait idea! As for the cat, I'm still exploring different shelters and breeders to find the perfect match.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information that could be helpful for Speaker A in generating a response. It provides context on Speaker B's background as an artist, their preferences for painting, and their experiences with pets, which connects to painting portraits of pets and owning pets as indicated in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, it also includes details, such as doing a painting for Elton John and having student debt, which do not directly contribute to the flow of the current conversation. While the information is well-structured and coherent, not all points directly inform the next response relating to the specific context about pets and paintings discussed here."
