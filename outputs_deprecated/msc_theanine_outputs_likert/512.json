    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well?\nSpeaker B: The older one seems to like it while the youngest cannot be bothered. Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon?\nSpeaker A: Yes!  As a matter of fact, I'm visiting my son that lives in Spain next month.  This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now!\nSpeaker B: Oh nice. You must be looking forward to it. He must have told you a lot about her. Do you think you would like her?\nSpeaker A: I think so.  She seems like a very sweet girl and she seems to care deeply about my son, so that's what matters most.  You know, maybe I can stop by and visit you as well, since you live in Europe.  France, Spain, Italy?  Where are you living now?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A's sons have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next. They will be coming for winter break from Europe. \nSpeaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite worrying about them traveling far away. Speaker A's sons play video games and listen to music in their rooms.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "**Helpfulness Score: 2**\n\n**Explanation:** \n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about Speaker Aâ€™s sons being in Europe, which slightly aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A mentions visiting a son in Spain. However, it lacks helpful details directly related to the ongoing conversation in the dialogue. The details about Speaker A's sons studying abroad and going to Italy next hint at future plans but are not directly relevant to the dialogue where the focus is on the upcoming visit to Spain and meeting the son's girlfriend. The information about the sons spending time playing video games and listening to music is tangential and does not contribute to understanding or developing the dialogue further. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it contained information directly tied to the current interaction, such as feelings toward the son's girlfriend or about visiting friends in Europe. Moreover, the memory structure provides limited insight into past interactions between the speakers, which makes it less beneficial for formulating a response. Hence, the MEMORY is rated as slightly below average in terms of helpfulness."
