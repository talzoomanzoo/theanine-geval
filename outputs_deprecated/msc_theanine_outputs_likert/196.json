Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket while majoring in Humanities in college. Now, Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week. Additionally, Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments. On top of that, Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "As of October 2023, I understand that the MEMORY provided should be rated on a scale of 1-5 based on its helpfulness for generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Here's the analysis and rating:\n\nHelpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY contains a lot of relevant information about Speaker A's current involvement in soccer, which is helpful given the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A's history with soccer is being discussed. Specifically, knowing that Speaker A currently plays as a striker and has been scoring well recently can help infer or speculate information about their past playing position. However, certain parts, such as details about Speaker Aâ€™s major during college or their part-time work, do not directly relate to the question asked in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Despite this, the MEMORY is generally well-structured, and the information that might not seem directly relevant is still phrased in such a way that a language model could easily identify these as less useful for the next response, focusing instead on the soccer-related aspects. Thus, the MEMORY provides substantial contextual cues for Speaker B, justifying a rating of 4."
