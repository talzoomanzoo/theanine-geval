Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\nSpeaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk?\nSpeaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous.\nSpeaker B: That sounds amazing! Did you bring a pet? I love doing the harder trails with my dog. Sometimes, it's very peaceful to get away from everything.\nSpeaker A: No, I don't have any pets; my apartment seems too small for a dog and I would worry about them being lonely all day when I'm at work. I was thinking about getting a pair of cats, but I haven't committed yet. How nice fo ryou to have company when you're walking though! What kind of dog do you have?\nSpeaker B: Cats can be nice! I used to have cats, but am allergic to them and had to give them to my friend. I have an Australian Kelpie who is a rescue. She is very energetic and smart!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B loves nature and works with animals, while Speaker A enjoyed reading 'Redwall' growing up and keeps an eye out for similar books. Speaker A is a fan of the Game of Thrones series and enjoys audiobooks. Speaker B is an artist who walks through nature for work and is interested in Pilates but dislikes the idea of having to follow specific steps in exercise. Speaker A is a city dweller who walks to work instead of driving and emphasizes the importance of proper form in exercise to prevent injuries.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "An Australian Kelpie sounds like a great companion for those trails. They are known for their intelligence and energy!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information that could be used in the context of the current dialogue. It indicates that Speaker B loves nature and works with animals, which aligns with their interest in taking nature walks and having a dog as a walking companion. This information is relevant to their current conversation about nature walks and pets. Additionally, knowing that Speaker B is an artist who walks through nature for work could add depth to their love for nature walks.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY also contains information that doesn't directly relate to the current dialogue context, such as Speaker A's interest in 'Redwall', Game of Thrones, audiobooks, and walking to work instead of driving. These interests are not particularly relevant to the current discussion about nature walks and pets, and thus are less helpful for generating a proper next response in this context.\n\nGiven this, the MEMORY includes both related and unrelated information, and it is structured in a way that reflects some aspects of their past interactions, though not all parts are immediately useful in the current dialogue. Therefore, the MEMORY deserves a middle-ground score of 3."
