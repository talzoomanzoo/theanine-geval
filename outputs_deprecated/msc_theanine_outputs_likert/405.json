Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read.\nSpeaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting? \nSpeaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far.\nSpeaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes. \nSpeaker A: why don't you like books like that?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A feels exhausted after looking after their energetic grandchildren. This leads Speaker A to suggest taking naps during quiet times and mentions the idea of watching her grandkids. Speaker B, who is a parent to a young son keeping them busy, considers volunteering at an animal shelter once her son begins school. Additionally, Speaker A, with 8 grandchildren, enjoys reading books and watching Netflix, while Speaker B's wife expresses a liking for Ken Jennings as a potential host for Jeopardy.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "I prefer books that are a bit more light-hearted and uplifting, like a good comedy or a heartwarming story.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some details about the interests and past interactions of Speaker A and Speaker B, but it largely lacks direct relevance to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY mentions that Speaker A enjoys reading books, which is mildly related to the current conversation about a book. However, most of the MEMORY is devoted to tangential details, such as Speaker A's exhaustion from looking after grandchildren and specific interests of Speaker B's wife. These pieces of information don't provide significant context for generating a meaningful response related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and don't clearly demonstrate a development or causality that could build onto the conversation. Additionally, the MEMORY doesn't discuss Speaker A's preference for fiction or explore why Speaker B finds such books intense, meaning it doesn't offer the language model much to work with in this scenario."
