Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company? Do you build computers or work on programming?\nSpeaker B: I do like my job. My job is to troubleshoot issues between the hardware and software, so I get to work with both.\nSpeaker A: That sounds interesting. That's great that you love your job, not many people do.\nSpeaker B: Love is a strong word! I do like it though. There have been jobs I hated and I'm great full not be in that place. Hows you job going?\nSpeaker A: Its going good. Its summer so we are really busy right now. I am just grateful to be back at work. How long have you worked for your company?\nSpeaker B: For about four years. It's an industry in flux which is stressful. I need stability for my family at this point. It has changed my focus, which I'm not used to yet. Are you considering any other options for work?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B's mother is a dentist, and Speaker A expresses interest in speaking to her about it, causing Speaker A to consider becoming a dentist and wanting to talk to Speaker B's mother.\nSpeaker A, who is 27 years old, has been looking at dental programs in colleges and is considering going back to school for dentistry in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains information about Speaker A's interest in dentistry and Speaker B's mother being a dentist. However, this background information is not directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on their current jobs, job satisfaction, and job stability in the tech industry. The content of the MEMORY does not provide useful contextual cues or development regarding the ongoing conversation about their work experiences and job situations. While the MEMORY is phrased naturally, its lack of connection to the current dialogue limits its helpfulness in contributing to a relevant and coherent response from Speaker A about the ongoing topic of job satisfaction."
