Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read.\nSpeaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A feels exhausted after looking after their lively grandchildren, who are now capable of keeping themselves entertained with technology or TV. Speaker A also suggests taking naps during quiet moments and mentions spending time with her grandchildren.\n2. Speaker A feels worn out after spending time with their energetic grandchildren, who have watched Toy Story multiple times.\n3. Speaker A, who has 8 grandchildren and likes reading books and watching Netflix, now has grandchildren who are old enough to entertain themselves with technology or TV. Speaker A also enjoys watching movies with her grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, it was a thrilling mystery novel. It's nice to have some quiet time to myself for a change.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically addressing the exhaustion Speaker A feels after spending time with their grandchildren. However, it lacks direct ties to the details about the new book Speaker A checked out, which is the focus of the immediate conversation. While the MEMORY hints at Speaker A's life and their relationship with grandchildren, it could be more interconnected and relevant to the specifics of the ongoing dialogue. The sentences also repeat the same themes (about grandchildren using technology and entertainment) without progressing the narrative or adding depth to the specific context of the book. Thus, while there is some relevant background, it's not developed to its fullest potential in guiding the next response."
