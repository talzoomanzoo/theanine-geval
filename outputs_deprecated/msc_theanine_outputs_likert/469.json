Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it?\nSpeaker B: Yes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see. \nSpeaker A: I definitely will, this sounds like such an amazing trip. How long has it been since you've been there yourself?\nSpeaker B: I was in Greece last two years ago.   I am excited to go again soon!    At somepoint I would like to take a cruise around the islands there.  It seems like a neat way to see all the Islands in an easy way.   Have you ever taken a cruise?\nSpeaker A: Only once before when I was very young, so I don't remember much. It sounds like such a relaxing way to enjoy the day, though. Maybe we can plan a cruise together sometime.\nSpeaker B: That would be fun!  I go to Europe a lot so maybe a cruise in the Caribbean would be nice.  I would like to see Saint Lucia and Saint Thomas. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian. Speaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five. Speaker B and their kids are excited about their upcoming trip to Greece.\nSpeaker A's mother is a pediatrician. Speaker A has kids and is familiar with Greek mythology. As a result, Speaker A caused Speaker B to plan a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five. This changed Speaker B's plan from leaving for a trip later in the summer, likely a month before school starts.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Those sound like beautiful destinations for a cruise. The Caribbean has so many stunning places to explore.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides a limited amount of helpful information in terms of generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY mentions Speaker B’s excitement about visiting Greece and planning a trip there with a family of five, but it inaccurately portrays Speaker B’s familiarity and past visits to Greece, as is evident in the dialogue where Speaker B mentions having been there two years ago. Furthermore, the MEMORY suggests that Speaker A influenced Speaker B's travel plans, which is inconsistent with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where no such influence is explicitly stated.\n\nSome connections from the MEMORY, such as Speaker A’s familiarity with Greek mythology, may hint at reasons why they would be interested in the Acropolis, but these are not directly utilized in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, MEMORY contains details (like Speaker A's mother being a pediatrician) that are irrelevant to the current dialogue, and there are inconsistencies present, especially with Speaker B's history and excitement about visiting Greece.\n\nOverall, while the MEMORY has elements related to the context, it is not well-phrased to provide useful or accurate information for continuing the conversation."
