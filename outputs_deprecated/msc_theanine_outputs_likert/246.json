Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not!\nSpeaker B: Have you been hiking lately?\nSpeaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me.\nSpeaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway?\nSpeaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day! I'll make it as fun as possible.\nSpeaker B: I will someday. just not in the summer when all the bugs are out! Where do you go hiking the most?\nSpeaker A: I like to go hiking in the local trails here. I am familiar with them and there's so many routes that I can take. Sadly, the bugs are as bad here as they are anywhere else.....\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is a personal trainer who loves camping in remote areas. This causes Speaker B to recently go on a long hike and enjoy it. Speaker A's Appalachian Trail hike will last for 10 days.\nSpeaker B enjoys taking cruises and is not as into the outdoors as Speaker A. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking as free activities. Speaker B gets scared by bugs and creepy crawlies in the outdoors. Speaker B shared tips on repelling mosquitos using sprays with 20% DEET and other active ingredients.\nSpeaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking as free activities. Speaker B gets scared by bugs and creepy crawlies in the outdoors. Speaker B shared tips on repelling mosquitos using sprays with 20% DEET and other active ingredients.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I can imagine the bugs being quite bothersome. Maybe I'll join you for a hike in the fall when they're not as bad.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information that aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly regarding Speaker A's interest in hiking and camping and Speaker B's fear of bugs. This can help Speaker B generate responses that acknowledge these interests and concerns. However, the MEMORY is somewhat repetitive and lacks clear connections or development of past interactions between the speakers. While it presents Speaker B's previous suggestions for mosquito repellents, it does not add much beyond what is already evident in the conversation. Additionally, certain details, like Speaker A's Appalachian Trail hike, do not directly relate to the current dialogue context. Therefore, the MEMORY has some relevance but is not fully leveraged to improve the conversation's development."
