Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, who does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies, wants Speaker A to teach them how to swim and programming. Speaker B also enjoys cruising in their car while listening to punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming. On the other hand, Speaker A, who enjoys cruising and has a favorite club in school, causes Speaker A to plan snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination. This leads to Speaker A and Speaker B discussing the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That would be awesome! I'll make sure there's some time for swimming and programming on the cruise too.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly regarding Speaker B wanting to learn to swim and their interest in punk music, which aligns with the playlist Speaker A created for their meetup. Additionally, Speaker B's interest in cruising is touched upon in both the MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as B expresses a desire to join A on a future cruise. However, the MEMORY introduces several details that are not directly relevant or mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as programming lessons and snorkeling plans, which are not mentioned in the context. Furthermore, some statements about Speaker A's favorite club and planning for snorkeling are not connected to the current conversation and might be distractions rather than helpful contextual cues. Hence, while the MEMORY provides some useful context, it includes extraneous information that doesn't significantly contribute to generating a proper next response for the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
