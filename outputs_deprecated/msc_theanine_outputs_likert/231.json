Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet? \nSpeaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name?\nSpeaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a pet parrot named Tasha and has red hair that makes them stand out. They are interested in adopting a rescue kitten named Zhao. \nSpeaker A is a country girl who loves animals and is a lacto-ovo vegetarian. This made them react positively when Speaker B suggested giving the rescue kittens Mandarin names based on their personalities. \nSpeaker B lives in the city they grew up in, loves animals, and has a cat that recently had a kitten. This situation causes Speaker B to have two sick kitties and recently received a rescue, leading them to look for someone to adopt one of the cats.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's wonderful to hear! I'm sure you'll find the perfect little companion to join your family soon.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provided offers some useful context regarding the past interactions and characteristics of both speakers. It helps in understanding Speaker A's affinity towards animals and their interest in adopting a rescue kitten, Zhao, which aligns with the dialogue about adopting kittens. The MEMORY also suggests that Speaker A was positive towards an idea proposed by Speaker B, providing context that might help shape their responses. Itâ€™s also relevant that Speaker B has two sick kitties, which provides context for why Speaker B might be looking for someone to adopt one of the cats and previously suggested adopting kittens. However, the information about Speaker A having a pet parrot and having red hair does not have any immediate relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Though structured coherently, the MEMORY includes some details that are not directly relevant or necessary for generating the next response. Overall, the MEMORY provides a moderate amount of useful information regarding the conversation themes but could be more targeted."
