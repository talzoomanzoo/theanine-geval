Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?\nSpeaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping?\nSpeaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp?\nSpeaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer?\nSpeaker A: I've only camped in a tent so far, but would like to try out a camper trailer. What do use for camping?\nSpeaker B: We usually do tents but we have camped in yurts too. Did you go to the zoo last weekend?\nSpeaker A: I see. Yes, I did make it to the zoo.  Have you gone to your local zoo?\nSpeaker B: I went to the Bronx zoo it was amazing! Did you get to see Joshua?\nSpeaker A: I think the Bronx Zoo is one of the best in the country.   Yes, I did see Joshua.  Did you use a season pass for the zoo or just a one time ticket?\nSpeaker B: One time. I was just there visititng family. What is your favorite zoo to visit?\nSpeaker A: I think the Ashville Zoo is nice. What are your plans for the next weekend?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A frequently visits the zoo and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys. Speaker B's daughter also likes monkeys and is asserting her independence. Speaker A, who grew up in big cities, has a kitten and loves visiting the zoo to see the tiger named Joshua. Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo to see the monkeys, which was caused by Speaker A suggesting taking pets to the zoo. Speaker B, a parent, is advocating for their daughter's school to have a field trip to the zoo.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes relevant details about Speaker A and Speaker B's shared interests and experiences related to the zoo, which is a topic in the current conversation. The mention of Speaker A enjoying seeing tigers and monkeys connects with the context where they discuss seeing Joshua, the tiger. Speaker B's mention of their daughter wanting to visit the zoo and efforts to organize a school trip is connected to the discussion of zoo visits, providing a broader understanding of Speaker B's perspective and interests. \n\nThe MEMORY is generally well-structured, providing information about past interactions between the speakers and offering contextual cues for the dialogue context. However, there is some extraneous information and minor causality confusion regarding the suggestion about taking pets to the zoo; details could be clearer for perfect coherence. Nonetheless, the MEMORY is mostly clear and demonstrates development in the interactions between the speakers."
