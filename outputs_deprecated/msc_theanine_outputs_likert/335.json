Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it! Thank you for the recommendation.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys watching suspense films, action, SF, horror, westerns, drama, and occasional good comedy. Speaker B is knowledgeable about movies and provides recommendations based on Speaker A's preferences. Speaker A is interested in watching movies, mentioned Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman. Speaker A relies on Speaker B for movie suggestions, mentioning a preference for comedies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information about Speaker B's knowledge and interests in films, which is helpful for generating a proper response in the context where Speaker A thanks Speaker B for a movie recommendation. The memory indicates that Speaker B is knowledgeable about movies and provides recommendations based on Speaker A's preferences, directly linking to the context of recommending \"Pulp Fiction.\" It also mentions Speaker A's interest in movies and relies on Speaker B for suggestions, which aligns with the dialogue context. However, the preference for comedies is less relevant to the given context. The sentences are naturally structured and clearly demonstrate the development of interaction between the speakers."
