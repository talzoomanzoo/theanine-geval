    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves Classmate A asking Classmate B to share something personal or sensitive, promising not to judge. The MEMORY contents, while reflecting past supportive interactions and characteristics between the classmates, do not contain direct or specific past information relevant to Classmate Aâ€™s request for disclosure. The MEMORY entries focus more on mutual support, experiences in space, and positive traits rather than anything directly relatable to the current context of revealing something without judgment.\n\nJudgement: No"
