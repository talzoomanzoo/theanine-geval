MEMORY contains several pieces of relevant information. For instance, Classmates B feels relieved to have someone to confide in (1), and Classmate A is supportive and compassionate (2). Additionally, Classmates A and B are close and have trust between them (3), which is supportive of the context of expressing true feelings.
