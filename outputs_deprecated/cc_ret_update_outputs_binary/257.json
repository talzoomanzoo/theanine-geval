The MEMORY mainly pertains to Co-workers A and B's past interactions, working history, and personal life, none of which relate directly to finding out where someone has moved to. The memories do not provide contextual information or specifics that would directly aid in effectively responding to Co-worker A's uncertainty about the location to which someone may have moved. \n\nJudgement: \"No\""
