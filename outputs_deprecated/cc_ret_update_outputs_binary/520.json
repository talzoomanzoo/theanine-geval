    "raw_prediction": "Neighbor A, I understand how you're feeling right now. It's completely normal to have those thoughts, but please remember that your worth is not defined by someone else's actions. You are more than enough just as you are. If you ever need to talk or just spend some time together, I'm here for you.",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The dialogue context reveals that Neighbor A is dealing with feelings of inadequacy about speaking to someone, possibly linked to a personal issue or relationship, not explicitly mentioned in the MEMORY. The MEMORY does not contain any direct information about Neighbor A's current feelings or issue. Moreover, although MEMORY mentions Neighbor A's grief over a grandmother's death, it doesn't specifically relate to the dialogue about feeling inadequate in a conversation. Therefore, MEMORY doesn't offer specific past information helpful for generating the next response in this dialogue context.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
