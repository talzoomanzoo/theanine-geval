    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY indicates that Classmates A and B have a good relationship, with mutual admiration and shared interests. This reinforces the emotion behind Classmates B's statement \"I thought we were friends,\" as it suggests a sense of betrayal in a strong friendship that Classmate B values. Hence, MEMORY provides context on why Classmate B might feel hurt or confused and can help Parent generate a response based on maintaining or repairing their friendship.\n\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
