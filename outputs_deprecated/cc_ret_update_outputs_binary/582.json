    "raw_prediction": "Yes, it's truly upsetting that there are individuals who would take advantage of others like that. We must all stay vigilant and protect our personal information as best as we can. On a brighter note, I can't wait to host a little get-together in the new house to celebrate with everyone.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about recent cases of identity theft, while the MEMORY entries focus on community events, neighborly relationships, and house building. None of the MEMORY points provide information related to identity theft or how it might relate to the neighbors' views or potential actions. Therefore, the MEMORY does not contain helpful past information relevant to generating a response to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\nJudgement: \"No\""
