    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around the concept of listening and the importance of giving advice or letting others feel heard. MEMORY provides background information about the Parent's values and living situation but doesn't contain information directly relevant to the topic of listening or providing advice based on being heard. The information in MEMORY does not directly pertain to listening as a valuable action.\nJudgement: \"No\""
