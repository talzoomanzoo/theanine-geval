    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY provides context on the positive relationship between the teacher and the student, as well as the student's recent stress and previous outburst. However, the specific topic of tolerance and how to build it up is not directly addressed in the MEMORY. The MEMORY focuses more on emotional support and communication strategies rather than directly advising on tolerance-building.\nJudgement: No"
