    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY contains information about Neighbors A's recent career change, the support and admiration from Neighbors B, and their past conversations about needing a change. While this demonstrates a supportive context, it does not give specific information about the distant relative or any inheritance-related topic mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Thus, the MEMORY is not directly helpful in generating a response about the newfound inheritance.\nJudgement: \"No\""
