MEMORY contains information about Co-worker A having a strong reputation and being commended by Co-worker B, which could relate to the situation of receiving the cash. Specifically, MEMORY 5 mentions that Co-worker A's reputation may have influenced Karen's hesitation to give them money. This seems related to the context of eventually receiving cash.\n\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
