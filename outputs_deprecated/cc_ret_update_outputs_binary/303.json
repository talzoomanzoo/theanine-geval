    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context \"How did that go?\" is likely referring to a past event or arrangement. Memory 1, 2, and 4 contain past events or offers of support and development that could be relevant to the success or outcome being discussed. Memory 2, with a shared experience of attending a concert, is a specific event that \"how did that go?\" could be directly referring to, marking it as potentially helpful context.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
