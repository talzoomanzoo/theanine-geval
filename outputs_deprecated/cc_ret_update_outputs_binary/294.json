    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY includes information about the student feeling stressed lately, which could explain the context of the student's apology and indicate a pattern of behavior. Additionally, it mentions a previous incident where the student yelled at the teacher, suggesting there is a history of such behavior. Both points are helpful for understanding the context of the dialogue and the teacher's potential response.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
