    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The memory contains information that the parent had a tough time in the past but found hope and someone willing to listen, which resonates with the current context of feeling alone and finding someone to listen. However, the specifics of the memory (arrest, lawyer, justice system) do not directly apply to the current dialogue context. Statements about finding hope and appreciating small moments could guide the child to offer help or reassurance, similar to the support the parent experienced. Therefore, on a general level, it may help inform the child's response, although it's not highly specific.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
