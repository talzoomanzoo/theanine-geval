    "raw_prediction": "I understand that it's hard to control your feelings, Co-workers A, but it's important to always consider the other person's perspective and boundaries. Just like you felt guilty about the pencil, it's crucial to acknowledge and respect the feelings and choices of others, especially when it comes to matters of the heart. Let's find healthier ways to express your feelings for the bride without causing harm.",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The Dialogue Context involves Co-worker A expressing feelings of guilt about borrowing a pencil without asking. The MEMORY contains information about this specific incident (point 1), and Co-worker B's reaction to it (point 3), which directly pertains to the situation at hand and could be useful for the Parent to craft a response related to forgiving minor transgressions and maintaining a positive relationship.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
