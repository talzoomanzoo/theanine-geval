    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY contains instances of Classmate B encouraging and supporting Classmate A in various contexts, like offering help and motivating them in their endeavors. However, these past interactions, while generally positive and supportive in nature, do not provide any specific information relating to the issue of cheating on taxes mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is about a serious matter (cheating on taxes), and none of the MEMORY points directly relate to this scenario or provide background that would inform Classmate B's reaction in this context.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
