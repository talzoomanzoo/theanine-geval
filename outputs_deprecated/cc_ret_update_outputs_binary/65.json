    "raw_prediction": "Please, listen to me. I understand why you might have misunderstood the situation, but I assure you there's nothing romantic going on. I value our relationship and would never do anything to jeopardize it. Let's talk this through calmly and clear up any misunderstandings.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY shows that Classmates A and B have a positive relationship, with mutual admiration and interest, both personally and academically. This contrasts with the negative statement in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Classmate A threatens to ruin Classmate B's career. Knowing their past positive interactions and mutual respect can help generate a response aimed at resolving conflict or understanding the root of Classmate A's reaction.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
