Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A's favorite tattoo is the one dedicated to their late father, saying \"for you I shall live\".\n2. Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\n3. Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father.\n4. Speaker A works at a coffee shop and is saving up for their next tattoo.\n5. Speaker A works at a coffee shop that their mom owned.\n6. Speaker B enjoys fishing and wishes their wife and sons could have joined them on the trip.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's a beautiful idea. I'm sure your mom will love it just as much as your dad did. It's wonderful to see how much you honor and cherish your parents.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It reveals that Speaker A has a favorite tattoo dedicated to their late father (Sentence 1), which directly relates to the context of getting a new tattoo for their mom to match the one for their dad. Additionally, Sentence 3 mentions Speaker A's enjoyment of tattoos and having multiple tattoos, which supports their consideration of getting a new one. However, there is less direct relevance in other sentences; while Sentence 5 mentions Speaker A working at a coffee shop that their mom owned, it does not provide a direct connection to the tattoo discussion. Sentences 4 and 6 do not contribute to the current dialogue context. Overall, the MEMORY offers some relevant insights but also includes less pertinent details."
