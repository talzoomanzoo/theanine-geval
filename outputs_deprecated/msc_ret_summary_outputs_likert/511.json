Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids? Speaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call! Speaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand. Speaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n2. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n3. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n4. Speaker B has grandkids who are more interested in phones and tablets than musical instruments.\n5. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n6. Speaker B mentions having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I think that sounds like a wonderful idea! It would be a great tradition to start with your grandkids. I wish I could spend more time with my own kids like that.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided is largely relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The dialogue involves a discussion about interacting with grandkids and the idea of an annual fishing trip. The MEMORY includes several points about Speaker B's experiences and perspectives on spending time with their grandkids, such as taking them fishing (with mixed reactions), wanting to make it an annual tradition, and enjoying trips to the park. These points align well with Speaker B's dialogue about spending time with their grandchildren and the fishing trip. It also touches upon Speaker B's awareness of the grandkids' interest in technology, complementing the context where they express a preference for traditional communication methods. Additionally, the mention of Speaker A being busy with work and having kids relates to their dialogue about needing to learn technology to keep in touch. Overall, the MEMORY effectively supports Speaker A in generating a proper response based on the context. However, the score is not a perfect 5 as some details, like grandkids' interest in phones, while slightly relevant, do not directly enhance the context of discussing a fishing trip or spending quality time."
