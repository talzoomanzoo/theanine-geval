Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume. Speaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment.  Speaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon? Speaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think? Speaker A: It depends on what you are trying to make out of origami, you can make some super complicated stuff, there's actually special paper that you can get for it! You may have seen origami be used in the hospital for some breathing aperatus! Speaker B: That's amazing. I had no idea, but that totally makes sense. Do you have to practice a lot -- sort of a use it or lose it kind of thing? Speaker A: Yea, I think for the more complicated origami it's kind of a use it or lose it but for the simple stuff you can usually take a couple months of and still remember to do it! Did you see origami in Japan?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n2. Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks.\n3. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully.\n4. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next.\n5. Speaker A wishes to visit the country where origami was originally created, possibly Japan.\n6. Speaker B is interested in making origami animals and finds the idea cute.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "No, I haven't been to Japan yet, but it's definitely on my bucket list. I can imagine how amazing it would be to see origami in its cultural birthplace.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but could be more connected to enhance helpfulness. Sentences like Speaker A offering to teach Speaker B origami (Memory 2) and Speaker B's interest in origami animals (Memory 6) are directly related to the ongoing conversation about learning and creating origami. These connections offer some development to the idea of Speaker A teaching Speaker B and Speaker B's interest in origami. However, sentences such as Speaker A wanting to make a lotus flower (Memory 3 and 4) and their desire to visit Japan (Memory 5) are less directly relevant to the current conversation about prize-winning and learning origami. While they are naturally structured, they donâ€™t add much to the context about teaching or learning, focusing more on Speaker A's interests and aspirations. Therefore, the memory provides some helpful contextual cues, but the overall helpfulness in generating a response from the DIALOGUE CONTEXT could be improved by more directly addressing the interaction between the speakers or emphasizing Speaker A's teaching offer."
