Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships! Speaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!   I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field? Speaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate? Speaker B: I have another year- so this year is really important I get internships and start making connections in the field.   I love going to the beach too.  What happened with your knees that now cause you so much pain? Speaker A: I think age has really been my knees downfall. I also used to hike a lot and I put a lot of pressure on my legs. That is great that you only have a year. Maybe when you graduate you can come hang out on the beach with me. I can't surf but I would love to watch you. Speaker B: That would be fun!  I like collecting shells too so we could do that as well.  I have a small collection of ones I have from around the world.  The farthest away was from Greece.  Have you traveled a lot?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys hiking along the coast and collecting shells, mentioning that their knees can't handle much else.\n2. Speaker B is interested in sports medicine and enjoys surfing.\n3. Speaker A is offering advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field.\n4. Speaker A suggests that surfing could be a way for Speaker B to make connections in the medical field.\n5. Speaker B has been going to the beach a lot and is learning to surf from friends in Jersey.\n6. Speaker B is looking for internships in the sports medicine field and has asked professors for letters of recommendation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I haven't traveled much, mainly because of my knees. But it sounds like you've had some amazing experiences! That's awesome you collect shells, I have a few from different beaches myself. Maybe we can compare collections sometime.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does contain some information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it captures Speaker B's interest in sports medicine and their pursuit of internships, which aligns with the context where they discuss potential internship opportunities. Speaker A's background in the medical field and enjoyment of beach activities like collecting shells are also pertinent as they relate to the conversation about the beach and physical activities. However, some sentences in the MEMORY are either not directly mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT or are slightly misaligned (e.g., Speaker A offering advice on the internship hunt or suggesting surfing as a way to make connections in the medical field), which may not fully reflect the context provided. The MEMORY is otherwise phrased naturally, making it relatively easy to glean relevant information related to the context, though not all entries clearly contribute to developing the conversation or establishing causality."
