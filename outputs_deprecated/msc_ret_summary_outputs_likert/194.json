Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam? Speaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A. Speaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now? Speaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done.  Speaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on? Speaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study? Speaker B: Ah, English should be easier than History. Sure, I can help you. What do you need to do exactly? Write an essay? Speaker A: Yeah, we have to write an essay and we have a spelling component towards the end of the exam, I sure could use a little help! Speaker B: No problem! I like correcting and editing essays. Although, it seems like your English is pretty good. I doubt you even need much help.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring.\n2. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n3. Speaker A wishes to get better grades and is hopeful for a soccer scholarship.\n4. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n5. Speaker B has been getting all A's in the sports medicine class.\n6. Both speakers value good grades and believe it can lead to better job opportunities.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks for the offer, I appreciate it! I just want to make sure I do really well on this final. Your help will definitely give me that extra boost of confidence.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, point 1 relates directly to the context where Speaker A mentions their history class, which they found not ideal because of their teacher. Additionally, point 6 reflects their shared value of good grades, aligning with the dialogue about exam performance and aspirations for improvement. \n\nHowever, most of the MEMORY points do not directly connect to the current conversation about final exams and studying for English. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it included more directly relevant details, such as previous interactions about studying techniques or Speaker B's willingness and capability to help with academic work, especially in English.\n\nWhile the MEMORY does provide some context, such as struggles with history and the general importance of grades, it includes irrelevant details, such as Speaker A's interest in a soccer scholarship and Speaker B's sports medicine background. These details do not contribute to generating a response relevant to the current dialogue about English exams. Nonetheless, the sentences in the MEMORY are naturally structured, allowing a language model to evaluate their relevance to the conversation."
