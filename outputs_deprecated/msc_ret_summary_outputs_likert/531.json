Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends? Speaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is unsure about what else there is to do in Alaska besides hiking.\n2. Speaker A mentions the outdoor activities they plan to do in Alaska, such as hiking.\n3. Speaker A has the impression that Alaska is cold and snowy, wondering if there are ski slopes there.\n4. Speaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together.\n6. Speaker A mentions that Alaska has mountains and glaciers, unsure if skiing is possible there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a fun idea! Yes, Alaska experiences the Midnight Sun during the summer months, so it will be daylight for most of the day. You'll have plenty of time to enjoy all the outdoor activities you have in mind.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker A and Speaker B's past interactions concerning their trip to Alaska. For example, sentences 1, 3, and 4 provide information that could be helpful in understanding Speaker B's uncertainty and planning state regarding the trip. Additionally, sentence 5 gives context about their relationship in terms of planning the trip together. However, the memory does not effectively highlight Speaker B's interest in specific activities like sledding with dogs, which is directly relevant to the current dialogue. Some sentences are not directly helpful (e.g., sentence 2), and while some information related to activities and characteristics of Alaska is provided (e.g., cold, snowy, has mountains and glaciers), the organization and development of past interactions could be improved for more coherent contextualization."
