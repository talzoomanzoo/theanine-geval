Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place? Speaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping? Speaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp? Speaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B expresses concern about leaving a kitten alone during their family camping adventures.\n2. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n3. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n4. Speaker B is away from their child and glad that the pets are with them.\n5. Speaker B is interested in finding family discounts for the zoo.\n6. Speaker A is offering advice and seems to have experience with children.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I prefer camping in a tent for the authentic outdoor experience. Have you ever considered bringing your kitten along on your camping trips?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides somewhat useful information regarding Speaker B's context, such as their role as a parent and their concern for family activities, which could help generate a response related to camping trips and family outings. However, most of the memory points are only tangentially related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and focus more on Speaker B's interest in the zoo rather than camping, which is the main topic of discussion. The connection between Speaker A's experience with children and the current context is not explicitly clear or helpful in crafting a response about camping preferences. Overall, MEMORY lacks strong connections or development directly related to the camping conversation, limiting its helpfulness."
