Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place? Speaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping? Speaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp? Speaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer? Speaker A: I've only camped in a tent so far, but would like to try out a camper trailer. What do use for camping? Speaker B: We usually do tents but we have camped in yurts too. Did you go to the zoo last weekend? Speaker A: I see. Yes, I did make it to the zoo.  Have you gone to your local zoo? Speaker B: I went to the Bronx zoo it was amazing! Did you get to see Joshua?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n2. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n3. Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys.\n4. Speaker A has a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo, particularly to see the tiger named Joshua.\n5. Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys.\n6. Speaker A suggests taking the pets to the zoo and mentions that most major cities have good zoos.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I did! Seeing Joshua always brings a smile to my face. Speaking of zoos, have you taken your daughter to see the monkeys yet?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some contextually useful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as details about Speaker A's interest in the zoo and their favorite animal, the tiger named Joshua. This directly corresponds to the part of the dialogue where Speaker B asks if Speaker A got to see Joshua at the zoo. Additionally, the MEMORY mentions Speaker B's interest in zoos due to their child's enthusiasm, which aligns with Speaker B sharing about their visit to the Bronx Zoo. However, not all entries in the MEMORY are directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the details about Speaker A's upbringing in big cities, which do not contribute to generating a response in this specific conversation. The structure of the MEMORY entries is relatively helpful but doesn't fully encompass all the nuances of the context, such as the camping discussion. Thus, while parts of the MEMORY are connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and phrased naturally, the overall set of memories could be more directly aligned with the conversation."
