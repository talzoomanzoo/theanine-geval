Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself! Speaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food? Speaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too? Speaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also? Speaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways? Speaker B: They've been better as I left my previous job so I'm spending more time with them, how do you manage to work full time and still keep those animals happy?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mentions having dogs and Speaker B admires them for their peaceful nature.\n2. Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid.\n3. Speaker B has elderly terriers and is planning to leave their part-time job for a break before starting a new one.\n4. Speaker B has two terrier dogs as pets.\n5. Speaker A has penguins at the zoo and enjoys working with animals, offering Speaker B a chance to help out.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B share a love for music and plan to have a house concert with their pets.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some relevant information about the speakers' pets, which relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT discussing their pets' habits and behavior. For example, MEMORY sentence 2 mentions Speaker A's pets, Journey and Sid, which is relevant but could be more informative regarding their behavior with food. However, most of the sentences in the MEMORY do not specifically aid in generating a coherent next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The mention of Speaker B's job change in sentence 3 and the shared love for music in sentence 6 are not directly useful or connected to the immediate discussion about pets and managing food-related habits.\n\nOverall, while there is some contextual relevancy, the MEMORY lacks depth and detail in the context of the ongoing conversation, particularly how the pets are handled in situations involving food, which is the central topic of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
