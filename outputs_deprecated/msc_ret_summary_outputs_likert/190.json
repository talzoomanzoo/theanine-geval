Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam? Speaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A. Speaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now? Speaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done.  Speaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring.\n2. Speaker B has been getting all A's in the sports medicine class.\n3. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n4. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n5. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n6. Speaker A wishes to get better grades and is hopeful for a soccer scholarship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some useful information that could be relevant for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Memory points 1 and 3 are particularly relevant because they align with Speaker A's struggle with history and their desire for better grades, which is consistent with the context where Speaker A discusses their history exam performance. Additionally, Memory points related to Speaker B, although not directly related to the current context, offer a background about Speaker B's academic life, which could be useful in a broader conversation about exams and academic pressure.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY also contains details that are mostly irrelevant to the current dialogue, such as Speaker B's focus on sports medicine and the pressure regarding their mother's position. These aspects, while well-structured and informative, do not contribute significantly to generating a direct response for the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe MEMORY is well-organized and provides a clear sense of each speaker's struggles and aspirations, which can aid in formulating responses for future dialogues, but its direct relevance to the current exchange is limited."
