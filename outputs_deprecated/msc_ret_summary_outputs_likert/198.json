    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her?

It helps because i am so passionate about it and hope to get to the Greek islands soon Speaker A: Yes I have been saving up for another trip to Italy! I can't wait. It's planned for next Spring. Do you have any plans to go back to Italy in the future?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology.\n2. Speaker A is fascinated by the architecture of Italy and enjoys studying history, especially through reading and watching documentaries.\n3. Speaker A is planning to travel to Italy alone for Spring Break and has friends from Europe meeting up with them.\n4. Speaker B has been to Italy in the past and enjoyed the food there.\n5.

    "raw_prediction": "I don't have any trips planned at the moment, but I would love to visit Greece for the history and Greek mythology. Maybe we can plan a trip together in the future!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several sentences that are helpful for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1 and 5 are particularly relevant because they align with the topics of Greek mythology and plans for visiting Greece, which are discussed in the conversation. Sentence 4 provides background on Speaker B's past experience in Italy, which is pertinent to the discussion about future travel plans. Sentence 3 relates to Speaker A's travel plans, adding context to their interest in Italy. However, sentences 2 and 6, while providing additional context about Speaker A, are less directly relevant to the specific dialogue exchange. Overall, the MEMORY provides a good amount of information to inform the conversation, but a couple of the sentences offer less immediate relevance to the specific dialogue at hand."
