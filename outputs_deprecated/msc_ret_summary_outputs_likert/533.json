Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends? Speaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do. Speaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars. Speaker B: Yeah, I think they go dark for a couple months and then have daylight for a couple months! I actually like night time, but having daylight all the time will make me crazy lol. Yeah I kind of hope it's dark for the camping but it will be very cold. I have heard Alaska has delicious ice cream. I want to try that while I'm there, \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mentions the outdoor activities they plan to do in Alaska, such as hiking.\n2. Speaker A has the impression that Alaska is cold and snowy, wondering if there are ski slopes there.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together.\n4. Speaker B is unsure about what else there is to do in Alaska besides hiking.\n5. Speaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet.\n6. Speaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's interesting about the daylight cycle in Alaska, I've always wanted to experience that too. And yes, the ice cream there is supposed to be amazing! It's definitely a must-try on your trip.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the fact that Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska (memory point 3) and that Speaker B is unsure about activities to do there besides hiking (memory point 4). However, most of the MEMORY entries are not particularly helpful for generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, details about Speaker A's impressions and familiarity with Alaska (memory points 1, 2, and 6) do not contribute significant information relevant to the ongoing conversation or guide the next response effectively. Additionally, the MEMORY lacks clearly structured information that outlines a development or connection between the past interactions of both speakers, which would help a language model identify relevant cues for the present context. Overall, the MEMORY provides limited assistance in shaping the next dialogue move."
