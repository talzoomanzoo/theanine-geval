Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play?  Speaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music.

    "raw_prediction": "I actually grew up on the beach, so I learned how to surf when I was really young. It was like second nature to me. But if you're interested in trying surfing, I'd be happy to teach you sometime!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful background information about the interests and hobbies of both speakers, specifically focusing on activities like music and surfing. However, while the MEMORY highlights Speaker A's musical involvement and band membership (point 6), which is relevant to the current context where they discuss musical instruments and teaching, much of the other information is related to surfing and fishing. These details are not directly relevant to the current conversation, which centers around music, learning instruments, and teaching. The information that Speaker A is in a band and plays music does provide context for their musical background, but the remaining points in the MEMORY are less connected to aiding the generation of a response based on the context of the musical discussion. The MEMORY is helpful in providing background about Speaker A and Speaker B's conversation dynamics and interests but could be more focused on the current topic discussed."
