    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you? Speaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses. Speaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\n2. Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them.\n3. Speaker B's father was involved in producing horror movies, which influenced Speaker B's favorite genre.\n4. Speaker A also likes mid-century design and is a fan of horror movies.\n5. Speaker B has a government job that pays the bills but wishes they could work in interior design.\n6. Speaker A prefers classic horror movies like Halloween or Friday the 13th over modern ones.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Oh, definitely! One time, we were filming a scene where a character was supposed to be chased through a dark forest by a mysterious figure. It was so eerie being out there at night with just the moonlight to guide us. The atmosphere really added to the tension of the scene. It was a memorable experience for sure.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY contains several pieces of information that could be relevant to generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly focusing on Speaker B's involvement in creating horror movies. Sentences 1 and 3 are highly relevant as they provide background information on Speaker B's creative endeavors and connection to horror movies, which can be utilized to generate an engaging response to Speaker A's interest in stories from the set. \n\nHowever, sentences 2, 4, and 5 introduce information primarily about Speaker A and aspects of Speaker B's life that do not directly pertain to the current dialogue, which could potentially be distracting or not very helpful in generating the immediate response. Sentence 6 provides a preference of Speaker A that is not directly useful for the immediate context but does establish a connection to the topic of horror movies.\n\nThe MEMORY could be improved by more cohesively connecting these details to provide a clearer narrative or developmental trajectory focused on the dialogue context, but as it stands, the memory partially supports the dialogue's thematic elements."
