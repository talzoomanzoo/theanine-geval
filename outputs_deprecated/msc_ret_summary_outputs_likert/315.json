Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think? Speaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons Speaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\n2. Speaker A's favorite tattoo is the one dedicated to their late father, saying \"for you I shall live\".\n3. Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father.\n4. Speaker A works at a coffee shop and is saving up for their next tattoo.\n5. Speaker A works at a coffee shop that their mom owned.\n6. Speaker B enjoys fishing and wishes their wife and sons could have joined them on the trip.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'll definitely keep that in mind. It's important to make it meaningful and personal. Plus, it will be a great conversation starter if I ever decide to get one.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides several pieces of information that are helpful for generating a next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The first few memories focus on Speaker A's tattoos, specifically the one dedicated to their late father, which directly aligns with the current dialogue about getting tattoos for parents. These memories provide context about Speaker A's tattoo preferences and history, which could contribute to a meaningful continuation of the conversation. While the memory mentioning Speaker B's enjoyment of fishing is not directly related to the current dialogue, the rest of the memories provide well-structured past interactions that establish continuity and relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about tattoos and family. The score is not a full 5 because not every sentence in the MEMORY is directly connected to the current dialogue context, notably the mention of Speaker B's fishing hobby; however, the structure and relevance of other parts of the MEMORY make it predominantly useful."
