Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well? Speaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work.\n2. Speaker B signed up for classes at the local college and has a background in football and karate.\n3. Speaker B practices karate and works as a lifeguard but is looking for a different career.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B both have interests in learning new languages.\n5. Speaker B attends football games at their old high school and finds that their football background helps in karate footwork.\n6. Speaker A has taken Spanish classes in the past and finds similarities between French and Spanish.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've actually been considering taking up karate myself! I think it would be a great way to stay active and learn some self-defense techniques.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information regarding Speaker B's background in karate, which connects directly to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B mentions practicing karate. Memory points 1, 2, 3, and 5 offer useful details about Speaker Bâ€™s karate practice, green belt level, and how football experience aids in karate footwork, which could be helpful for generating further dialogue on karate or activities related to martial arts. However, the MEMORY contains some unrelated information, such as Speaker B considering going back to school for IT or both speakers' interest in languages (points 4 and 6), which do not directly relate to the current context about martial arts, potentially making it harder for a language model to focus on generating a coherent next response related to martial arts classes. Thus, while helpful information is present, the utility of the MEMORY could be improved by better focusing on the current dialogue topic."
