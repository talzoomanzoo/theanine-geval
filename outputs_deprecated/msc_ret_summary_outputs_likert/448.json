Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive. Speaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price? Speaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music Speaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it. Speaker A: I'll keep trying! Have you had any luck lately? Speaker B: No I haven't! I keep hoping that I will so I can buy my dreamhouse but I know the chances are low. Speaker A: Would you move to the city? It'd be too much for me\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n3. Speaker B bought 20 lotto tickets with the same numbers, aiming to get a bigger share of the jackpot if they win.\n4. Speaker A bought 50 lotto tickets with different numbers to increase their chances of winning.\n5. Both speakers dream of having a city and country house or a summer and winter home.\n6. Speaker B is open to moving to the country to be further away from neighbors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I actually prefer the idea of moving to the country. I like the idea of being further away from neighbors and having more space. Plus, it's usually more peaceful and relaxing out there.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains information about Speaker A and Speaker B's past discussions on lotto tickets and dreams related to winning, which is somewhat connected to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT where they are discussing the hopefulness of winning the lottery. Thus, it provides some relevant context that could inform Speaker B's response. For example, it highlights Speaker B's openness to moving to the country, which ties into the current conversation about moving to the city. However, the MEMORY largely focuses on past strategies and aspirations, which does not directly guide Speaker B's immediate interaction with Speaker A regarding the new iPhone. As a whole, the MEMORY could be better structured to emphasize more immediate and causally linked information relevant to the next response Speaker B could give about the iPhone or Speaker A's moving preferences."
