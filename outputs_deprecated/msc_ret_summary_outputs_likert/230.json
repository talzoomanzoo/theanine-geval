Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you. Speaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden.\n2. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing.\n3. Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more.\n4. Speaker A jokes about space weeds and expresses a desire to see space.\n5. Speaker A plays the clarinet in a band concert and has a solar investment for their office building.\n6. Speaker A's parents are teachers.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds beautiful! I'll definitely consider adding plum and pear trees to my garden. Thank you for the suggestion.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information in relation to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly sentence 1, which establishes that Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening and has a thriving garden. This directly supports Speaker B's suggestion about planting plum and pear trees, as it highlights their expertise in gardening. Sentence 2 is somewhat relevant as it shows Speaker A struggles with gardening, which would explain their reason for seeking suggestions in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the remaining sentences (3, 4, 5, and 6) are not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT or to the immediate conversation about gardening. While sentences 4 and 5 offer insights into Speaker A's interests outside of gardening, and sentence 3 provides personal context about Speaker B, they do not aid in generating an immediate response for the given context. Thus, the MEMORY is partially connected and relevant, but lacks cohesive structure and full development of the speakers' interaction regarding gardening."
