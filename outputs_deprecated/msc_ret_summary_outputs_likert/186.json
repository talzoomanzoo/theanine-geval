Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n2. Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring.\n3. Speaker B has been getting all A's in the sports medicine class.\n4. Speaker B is on their way to college and studying sports medicine.\n5. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n6. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information that could inform Speaker A's next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it reveals that Speaker B is focused on sports medicine and is pressured to maintain high grades (sentences 2, 3, 4, 6), which could relate to their current exam situation and their feelings about it. This information may allow Speaker A to empathize or offer relevant advice or comments about exams and academic pressure. However, the MEMORY also contains some unrelated details (e.g., Speaker A's opinion on history and gym), which do not contribute directly to generating a proper next response. The sentences are structured well and provide a sense of background, but the direct relevancy to the immediate dialogue is moderate rather than strong."
