Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself! Speaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food? Speaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A's pet raccoon enjoys eating pizza.\n2. Speaker A mentions having dogs and Speaker B admires them for their peaceful nature.\n3. Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid.\n4. Speaker B has two terrier dogs as pets.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B share a love for music and plan to have a house concert with their pets.\n6. Speaker B asks Speaker A if they have had a pet raccoon before.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, my terriers have definitely tried to sneak some food off the counter before. It's a constant battle to keep them from getting into things they shouldn't!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful and relevant information for Speaker B to generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, sentences 1 and 3 regarding Speaker A's pet raccoon named Journey are particularly relevant, as they directly connect to the current discussion about Journey eating pizza. These sentences provide important details about Journey being a notable pet of Speaker A, which aligns with the context of the conversation.\n\nHowever, there are additional details in MEMORY that are not directly relevant to the current dialogue context, such as Speaker B having terrier dogs, the shared love for music, and planning a house concert with pets. While these details reflect past interactions between the speakers, they are not directly tied to the ongoing discussion about controlling pets around food. Furthermore, sentences like 2 and 6 could be of moderate relevance but are currently less focused since the dialogue context is more concerned with Journey's behavior specifically related to eating food.\n\nOverall, while MEMORY contains some useful information aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, it could be better organized and focused solely around the relevant aspects of the conversation to achieve a higher score."
