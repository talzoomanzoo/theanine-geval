Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast. Speaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class and enjoys it.\n2. Speaker A is planning to take summer courses soon and is very active, enjoying martial arts.\n3. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts.\n4. Both Speaker A and Speaker B are interested in martial arts and enjoy learning new things.\n5. Speaker A is a martial arts teacher and student and is pursuing an athletic training degree in college.\n6. Speaker A is enrolled in a class on the history of martial arts and is majoring in athletic training.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, it was pretty crowded today. I love seeing so many people interested in martial arts. It's such a great way to stay active and learn something new.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model to generate a response. It includes relevant details such as Speaker A's interest and participation in martial arts, which directly aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A mentions attending a martial arts class. This reinforces the continuity in Speaker A's interest. The detail about Speaker A planning to take summer courses (memory sentence 2) and their involvement in martial arts as part of their athletic training degree (memory sentence 5) further deepen the context. Also, memory sentence 4 underlines the shared interest in martial arts between the speakers, which offers a connection point. However, not all details in MEMORY are directly applicable to the current dialogue context, such as Speaker B's software work and online class on martial arts history (memory sentence 3). While these elements provide occasional context, they are less coherent for generating the next response in the current dialogue. Therefore, a score of 4 accurately reflects that the memory contains some helpful and contextually relevant information but does have some elements that are less connected to the ongoing exchange."
