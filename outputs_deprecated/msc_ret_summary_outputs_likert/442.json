Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B believes that luxurious items distract from the value of their family.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n3. Speaker A bought 50 lotto tickets with different numbers to increase their chances of winning.\n4. Speaker A used to live in a suburb of DC and misses the convenience of city life.\n5. Speaker B is open to moving to the country to be further away from neighbors.\n6. Speaker A works on a family farm and will be using the new truck for farm work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains various snippets of information about Speaker A and Speaker B. However, most of the entries in MEMORY are not directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Speaker A buying a new iPhone. The only potentially related memory is about Speaker B's belief regarding luxurious items (MEMORY 1), which hints at a possibly relevant attitude towards expensive purchases. However, this is a weak connection and does not provide substantial context or development about the speakers' interactions. Other memories, such as those about buying lotto tickets, living locations, and farm work, do not connect well with the context of the iPhone purchase. While the sentences are generally well-phrased, they lack a coherent connection to the dialogue context, making it harder for a model to generate a contextually appropriate response."
