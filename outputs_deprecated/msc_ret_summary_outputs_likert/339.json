    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far. Speaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes.  Speaker A: why don't you like books like that?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n2. Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix.\n3. Speaker A has grandchildren and enjoys watching movies with them.\n4. Speaker B has a son and enjoys reading books, particularly about animals.\n5. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n6. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I prefer reading more informative books, like ones about animals. It's just my preference.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information about Speaker A's and Speaker B's interests, such as reading preferences (crime drama for Speaker A and books about animals for Speaker B) and their family dynamics (Speaker A's grandchildren and Speaker B's son). This offers some helpful context for Speaker B to generate a relevant response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly about book preferences, which is the focus of the conversation. However, the MEMORY includes some repetitive or less directly relevant details (like Netflix preferences), and it lacks more specific interplay or past interactions between the two speakers. Structurally, while the details are mostly clear, they do not entirely demonstrate a development or causality of prior interactions, limiting their helpfulness to the current dialogue."
