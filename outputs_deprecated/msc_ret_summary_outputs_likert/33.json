Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work.\n2. Speaker B signed up for classes at the local college and has a background in football and karate.\n3. Speaker B practices karate and works as a lifeguard but is looking for a different career.\n4. Speaker B attends football games at their old high school and finds that their football background helps in karate footwork.\n5. Speaker A is studying marketing and enjoys it.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B both have interests in learning new languages.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I have also dabbled in Taekwondo in the past. The kicks are quite different from Karate but I enjoyed learning new techniques.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be useful for Speaker B to generate a response in the context of discussing martial arts experiences. In particular, Memory sentences 1, 2, and 3 mention that Speaker B practices karate and has a background in football, which relates to the question posed by Speaker A about martial arts. Additionally, Memory sentence 4 provides a connection between football and karate, which could be brought into the conversation. However, the details about Speaker B considering going back to school or looking for a different career, as well as information about Speaker A's studies and language interests, are not directly related to the specific dialogue context about martial arts. While these details are phrased clearly, they dilute the focus of the MEMORY in relation to the current dialogue. Overall, the MEMORY is partially helpful, but not all information directly aids in forming the next conversational response."
