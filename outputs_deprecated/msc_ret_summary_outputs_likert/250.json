Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden. Speaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways? Speaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there? Speaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n4. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n5. Speaker B recommends checking out the volcanoes in Sweden for a unique experience.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B discussed the differences between Sweden and the US, including coffee breaks.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds amazing! I'll definitely add Visby to my list of places to visit. Thanks for the recommendation!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY includes several helpful pieces of information that provide context for the conversation between Speaker A and Speaker B. Specifically, sentences 1, 2, and 3 mention Speaker A's intentions around traveling to Sweden and the fact they have a cousin there, directly tying into the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A discusses planning a trip to Sweden and their cousin's involvement. Sentence 4, which notes Speaker B's fond memories of Sweden, provides additional context to Speaker B's interest in discussing the trip. However, sentence 5 seems inaccurate, as Sweden is not known for volcanoes, and sentence 6 provides general background on past discussions but is not directly relevant to the current conversation. These sentences could confuse the language model or misdirect the topic. Overall, the MEMORY is mostly beneficial for generating a relevant response in the given dialogue, but certain inaccuracies reduce its effectiveness."
