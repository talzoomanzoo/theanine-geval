Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n2. Speaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks.\n3. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n4. Speaker B shared tips on repelling mosquitos using sprays with 20% DEET and other active ingredients.\n5. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking as free activities.\n6. Speaker B gets scared by bugs and creepy crawlies in the outdoors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, I went on a long hike last weekend and it was amazing. I love being out in nature and exploring new trails.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY successfully provides a deep context and history of the interactions between Speaker A and Speaker B, as it pertains to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Memories 3 and 4 particularly support the conversation since they establish that Speaker A has planned outdoor activities and has taken advice on repelling mosquitoes from Speaker B. Additionally, memories 1 and 6 can influence how Speaker A might structure further conversations around outdoor activities and address Speaker B's concerns about bugs. The memos are relevant, naturally connected, and depict the development of their discussion interests and past recommendations. Thus, it provides helpful information for generating a relevant and coherent response."
