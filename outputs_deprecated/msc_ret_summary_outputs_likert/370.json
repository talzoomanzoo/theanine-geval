Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job! Speaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. Speaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?   Speaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone. Speaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist, mentioning the ups and downs of the profession.\n2. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n3. Speaker A works at a stable and enjoys being around horses.\n4. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n5. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n6. Speaker B lives in the city and is interested in having a horse in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's really kind of you to offer. I'll definitely consider it, thank you. And I'm glad to hear about your client's success.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY offers some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically mentioning details about Speaker B being a therapist (which aligns with the dialogue's topic) and Speaker A's interest in horses (which was discussed in the conversation). However, some other elements in the MEMORY are not directly relevant to the dialogue, such as Speaker B being a football fan or living in the city and their interest in having a horse in the future. These are extraneous details that do not contribute to the response generation based on the current context. The connection between the MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is partially helpful but could be more focused on the relevant shared topics."
