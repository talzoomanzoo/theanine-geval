Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet? Speaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there? Speaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay? Speaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately? Speaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"' Speaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history. Speaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing?  Speaker B: He's doing well! He just finished theatre camp and he's fighting with my sister because he wants to dye his hair green hahaha. Speaker A: Young people today really have different values than our generation had. Acting sounds like it would be personally rewarding. I also like the arts. I play guitar and piano. You mentioned that you have a poll. That sounds refreshing in the hot weather. Speaker B: Yes it's great, but it hasn't stopped raining here! How's the weather where you are? Speaker A: Sorry for the typo. I meant \"pool\". Weather here is very hot and humid. It is miserable if you don't have air conditioning. Pollen count is also very high, so the air quality is poor. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n2. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation.\n4. Speaker A is worried about gas mileage and asks about the fuel efficiency of Speaker B's car.\n5. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n6. Speaker B plans to touch up their hair for the summer due to sun and pool damage.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds rough! I hope it cools down for you soon. I still need to pack for my trip, but I'm more worried about sun and pool damage to my hair lol.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information, but not all of it is directly useful for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, points 1, 2, and 5 mention Speaker B's trip plans, which could be pertinent given the context of traveling to Costa Rica discussed in the dialogue. However, the specific details about Easter weekend or the adventurous nature of the break do not tightly connect to the current dialogue. Other points, such as Speaker A and B's sense of humor or Speaker A's concern about gas mileage, are not relevant to the current context involving reading interests, cultural experiences, weather discussions, and personal anecdotes shared about family and hobbies. The MEMORY does not provide seamless natural connections that showcase a relationship or development of previous interactions related to the ongoing discussion, reducing its helpfulness."
