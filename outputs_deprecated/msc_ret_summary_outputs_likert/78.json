Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me? Speaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A invited Speaker B to visit and mentioned looking into flights.\n2. Speaker B found flights that work for their schedule and price and will be visiting Speaker A in a couple of weeks.\n3. Speaker A has invited Speaker B to visit them and is excited about the trip.\n4. Speaker A plans to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit.\n5. Speaker B is planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n6. Speaker A has visited Alaska and describes it as beautiful, suggesting cheap flights to Anchorage.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It concisely captures the overarching theme of Speaker B planning a visit to Speaker A, which aligns with the current topic of conversation. The elements about flights, tours, and activities are clearly connected, showcasing a development of past interactions and plans. The sentences are naturally structured and provide a basis for Speaker A to further discuss visiting plans, weather, or confirming mutual interests like concerts and tours. However, while most sentences relate well to this context, not all provide immediate context to the current exchange about airfare's fluctuation and impending visit accuracy. Thus, it does not perfectly align with ongoing or dynamic shifts in the conversation, resulting in a score of 4 rather than 5."
