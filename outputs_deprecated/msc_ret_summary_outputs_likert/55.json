Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n2. Speaker B has a young daughter who is 8 years old and is becoming independent.\n3. Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys.\n4. Speaker B's daughter likes monkeys and is starting to assert her independence.\n5. Speaker B is away from their child and glad that the pets are with them.\n6. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "Yes, she had a great time! She loved seeing all the animals, especially the monkeys. She's really starting to assert her independence, so she had a blast exploring the zoo on her own.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information for Speaker B to generate a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1, 3, and 4 in MEMORY are the most relevant to the conversation about the trip, as they indicate that Speaker B's daughter wanted to see monkeys at the zoo and that Speaker B has been advocating for a school trip there. These elements could be useful for Speaker B to respond to how the trip was and whether the daughter liked the place, particularly focusing on her interest in the zoo and especially the monkeys.\n\nHowever, there are also sentences that seem somewhat disconnected from the immediate context of the trip (such as sentence 5, about being away from the child, and sentence 6, about Speaker A's preferences, which may not directly contribute to generating the next response). Additionally, while each sentence does provide insights into Speaker B's relationship and activities with their daughter, they don't all create a clear narrative connected specifically to the dialogue context presented. Thus, the MEMORY earns a mid-range score for providing partial but not fully cohesive assistance."
