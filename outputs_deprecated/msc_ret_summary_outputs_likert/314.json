Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think? Speaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A's favorite tattoo is the one dedicated to their late father, saying \"for you I shall live\".\n2. Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father.\n3. Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\n4. Speaker A works at a coffee shop and is saving up for their next tattoo.\n5. Speaker B enjoys fishing and wishes their wife and sons could have joined them on the trip.\n6. Speaker A works at a coffee shop that their mom owned.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That would be a wonderful tribute to your family. Tattoos can hold so much meaning, it's a great way to carry those special memories with you everywhere.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several pieces of information that are relevant and helpful for generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it highlights Speaker Aâ€™s affinity for tattoos, including details about tattoos dedicated to their late father (memories 1 and 2). This contextualizes Speaker A's desire to get a tattoo for their mom, mirroring the one for their father. Furthermore, memory 4 mentions Speaker A is saving up for a tattoo, indicating financial planning related to tattoos, which can contribute to the conversation contextually. Memory 6 links Speaker A's current workplace to their mother, giving additional depth to their relationship with her, potentially relevant in discussing a tattoo dedicated to her. However, memories 5 and 6 regarding Speaker B's fishing interest and family lack direct relevance to the main topic of tattoos, despite being naturally phrased. Overall, the memories are mostly helpful for the language model to generate a response relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which justifies the score of 4."
