Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids? Speaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call! Speaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand. Speaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip?  Speaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery Speaker B: Yes I think that's a great idea, how is work at the library?  Speaker A: Busy, and demanding because we are short staffed. While there seems to be little need for a library these days, I find that we have less staff to get everything done Speaker B: Well if you ever need someone to come and help for a couple of hours here and there, give me a call, you know how much I love to be in the library anyway\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is a retired librarian who enjoys implementing creative activities in their library.\n2. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n3. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n4. Speaker A sees parents bringing in their little kids to the library as encouraging.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B agree on the importance of reading and the value of libraries, despite the rise of the internet.\n6. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you so much for the offer, that means a lot to me. I will definitely keep that in mind for when things get even busier. Your help would be greatly appreciated.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the fact that Speaker B has grandkids and is interested in planning an annual fishing trip with them. This is directly connected to the conversation about spending time with grandkids and the fishing trip idea. Additionally, the MEMORY mentions Speaker A's job at the library, which is discussed in the context of being busy and understaffed. However, not all sentences in the MEMORY are directly tied to the current dialogue context; for instance, details about creative activities and parents bringing kids to the library could be more directly relevant to other conversations. While the sentences are naturally phrased and related to Speaker A and Speaker B's past interactions, not all parts of the MEMORY are utilized in the current conversation, which affects the score."
