Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun! Speaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim.  Speaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you  Speaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises. Speaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you? Speaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it. Speaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car? Speaker B: Yes, there are several. Hope we could meet and You possibly teach me about computer programming. Speaker A: That would be great too. I like to program in several different languages. Do you have a preference? Speaker B: No, I'm just getting started so I don't have a preference. Maybe you could show me what you prefer and we could start there. Speaker A: Sure. I usually like to start with html and css so we can start there. We'll order some pizzaburgers to help us out. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n2. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n4. Speaker A has planned to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination.\n5. Speaker B is interested in learning programming and is already practicing.\n6. Speaker A has planned a cruise to the Caribbeans.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a plan! I can't wait to dive into programming with you. And I'm definitely looking forward to those pizzaburgers too.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information about the past interactions between Speaker A and Speaker B, which can assist in generating an appropriate next response. Key points from the DIALOGUE CONTEXT are accurately reflected in MEMORY, such as Speaker A offering to teach Speaker B swimming and programming (Memory 1) and their discussion of a cruise to the Caribbean (Memory 3 and 6). However, there are some inaccuracies that may cause confusion. For example, Memory 2 suggests Speaker B wants to listen to punk music while swimming and learning programming, which is not explicitly stated in the context and may mislead the model. Despite this minor issue, the MEMORY overall provides structured information that connects well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, supporting understanding and response formulation."
