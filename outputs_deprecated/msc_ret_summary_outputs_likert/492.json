Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like. Speaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk? Speaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous. Speaker B: That sounds amazing! Did you bring a pet? I love doing the harder trails with my dog. Sometimes, it's very peaceful to get away from everything. Speaker A: No, I don't have any pets; my apartment seems too small for a dog and I would worry about them being lonely all day when I'm at work. I was thinking about getting a pair of cats, but I haven't committed yet. How nice fo ryou to have company when you're walking though! What kind of dog do you have? Speaker B: Cats can be nice! I used to have cats, but am allergic to them and had to give them to my friend. I have an Australian Kelpie who is a rescue. She is very energetic and smart! Speaker A: I had cats as a child and I think that they're a bit easier to care for than dogs, especially in the city. I am a dog lover as well though; Australian Kelpies are gorgeous! What is her name? Does she walk well off-leash?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B lives in the country, loves nature, and works with animals.\n2. Speaker A is a city dweller who walks to work instead of driving.\n3. Speaker B is an artist who walks through nature for work.\n4. Speaker B enjoys reading the Odd Thomas and Dark Tower series and finds inspiration for their artwork during nature walks.\n5. Speaker A enjoys reading sci-fi and mysteries, while Speaker B prefers fantasy books.\n6. Speaker A asks about Speaker B's new artwork and acknowledges their need for inspiration.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you! Her name is Luna, and she walks very well off-leash. She's a great companion on my nature walks, always keeping me company and exploring alongside me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information about Speaker A and Speaker B, which can facilitate generating a relevant response. For instance, details about Speaker B living in the country, working with animals, and being an artist who walks through nature for inspiration (points 1 and 3) are helpful in understanding Speaker B's lifestyle and interests, which align with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about nature walks and pets. However, some parts of the MEMORY, such as Speaker B's book preferences or Speaker A and B's reading interests (points 4 and 5), are not directly relevant to the current topic of discussion. Additionally, the MEMORY could be better structured to clearly show the development and past interactions related to the current dialogue. Overall, while it includes some beneficial information, it could be more effectively organized and relevant to receive a higher score."
