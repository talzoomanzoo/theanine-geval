Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think? Speaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons Speaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use. Speaker B: I am a little scared of needles though. Were your tattoos painful?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father.\n2. Speaker A's favorite tattoo is the one dedicated to their late father, saying \"for you I shall live\".\n3. Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\n4. Speaker A works at a coffee shop and is saving up for their next tattoo.\n5. Speaker A works at a coffee shop that their mom owned.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B have a conversation about their personal interests and trips they have taken for work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "They can be a bit painful, but the end result is worth it for me. Maybe you could start with a small tattoo in a less sensitive area to see how you handle it.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it mentions that Speaker A has a tattoo dedicated to their late father (sentences 1 and 2), which connects to the idea of getting a new tattoo for their mom as discussed in the dialogue. This information enhances the context as it highlights Speaker A's sentimental reasons for their tattoos, aligning with the discussion about honoring parents. Additionally, the fact that Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and is planning more (sentences 1 and 3) naturally ties into the ongoing conversation about getting tattoos, which aids in understanding Speaker A's character and intentions. The information about Speaker A working at a coffee shop and saving up for tattoos (sentences 4 and 5), although less directly related to the dialogue about tattoos, adds extra context on Speaker A's life circumstances and motivations. This comprehensive background helps form a more complete picture of Speaker A, though it is less directly connected to Speaker B's comment about being scared of needles. Overall, the memories are structured well and provide clear, relevant information aiding in the generation of appropriate responses, resulting in a score of 4."
