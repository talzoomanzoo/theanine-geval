    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive. Speaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price? Speaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music Speaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it. Speaker A: I'll keep trying! Have you had any luck lately?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n3. Speaker A bought 50 lotto tickets with different numbers to increase their chances of winning.\n4. Speaker B bought 20 lotto tickets with the same numbers, aiming to get a bigger share of the jackpot if they win.\n5. Speaker B's children have been sick, and Speaker B also had a fever, possibly influencing their decision to buy 20 lotto tickets.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B have a friendly interaction and part ways on a positive note.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Not yet, but who knows, maybe my lucky numbers will come through this time. I'm hoping for a big win to help with some unexpected expenses.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information that is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly regarding the discussion of lotto tickets, which connects to Speaker A's mention of trying to win the lotto. The MEMORY provides context on the different strategies Speaker A and Speaker B have towards playing the lotto, which could be incorporated into the dialogue. However, the details about the specific number of tickets and Speaker B's children being sick are not very useful in moving the conversation forward or developing the interaction in the given context. Additionally, the MEMORY does not offer significant information about Speaker B's personal feelings or thoughts on the iphone, which could be helpful in generating further responses. Overall, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful but does not provide enough naturally structured information to warrant a higher score."
