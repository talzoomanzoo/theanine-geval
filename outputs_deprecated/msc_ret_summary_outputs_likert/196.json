Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys Greek mythology and did a case study on Poseidon, the God of the Sea, Earthquakes, and Horses.\n2. Speaker B does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology.\n3. Speaker A has a daughter and mentions working and having to take time off.\n4. Speaker B has a child referred to as \"the little monster\" and is a parent.\n5. Speaker B goes to the beach everyday if possible, with their 5-year-old daughter who loves to swim and play in the sand.\n6. Speaker A is fascinated by the architecture of Italy and enjoys studying history, especially through reading and watching documentaries.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "She's doing great, thanks for asking! I haven't started teaching her about Greek mythology yet, but I think she would love the stories. I'll have to start incorporating some of those tales into our bedtime stories.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful information that can aid in generating a relevant next response for Speaker B. Sentences 1, 2, and 5 are particularly helpful as they establish Speaker B's interest in Greek mythology, which directly relates to Speaker A's question about sharing this interest with their daughter. Sentence 5 further establishes an activity Speaker B and their daughter enjoy together, providing more context for Speaker B's relationship with their daughter. Sentence 3 offers context about Speaker A, which helps understand the dynamics between the two speakers. Sentence 4 gives more insight into Speaker B's life as a parent, although its phrasing adds less to the context. Sentence 6, while not directly related to the dialogue context, is well phrased and doesn't detract from the connection. Overall, the MEMORY is structured in a way that naturally presents the information, showing clear connections and coherence in the context provided."
