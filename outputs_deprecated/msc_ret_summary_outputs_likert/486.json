Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is an artist who walks through nature for work.\n2. Speaker B lives in the country, loves nature, and works with animals.\n3. Speaker B enjoys reading the Odd Thomas and Dark Tower series and finds inspiration for their artwork during nature walks.\n4. Speaker A recommends the new album by Highly Suspect to Speaker B.\n5. Speaker A is a fan of the Game of Thrones series and enjoys audiobooks.\n6. Speaker A is a city dweller who walks to work instead of driving.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds amazing! Nature walks are always so inspiring for me. I love seeing how the colors and textures in the environment can influence my artwork.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for Speaker B, who is expected to generate a response to Speaker A about the nature walk. The memory entries reveal that Speaker B is an artist who enjoys nature walks, which is directly relevant to the topic of DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This connection is important as it provides background for why Speaker B might be interested in Speaker A's experience. Additionally, knowing that Speaker B lives in the country and loves nature further supports the natural connection to the dialogue context, helping the language model craft an engaged response. The mention of Speaker B finding inspiration for artwork during nature walks adds depth to their character and enriches the interaction. \n\nWhile some entries about Speaker A, such as being a fan of audiobooks or living in the city, are not directly relevant, they are well-structured and provide a fuller picture of the relationship and differences between the speakers. For the most part, the memory is clear and provides useful context for the language model. However, a perfect score is not warranted because not all information provided is directly necessary for generating a response to the nature walk dialogue."
