Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think? Speaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons Speaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use. Speaker B: I am a little scared of needles though. Were your tattoos painful? Speaker A: Most of them were not.  It really depends on where on your body you get them.  Most of mine are on areas that didn't hurt.  The one on my foot and the one behind my ear did hurt a good bit.  Where were you thinking about getting it?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father.\n2. Speaker A's favorite tattoo is the one dedicated to their late father, saying \"for you I shall live\".\n3. Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\n4. Speaker A works at a coffee shop and is saving up for their next tattoo.\n5. Speaker A works at a coffee shop that their mom owned.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B have a conversation about their personal interests and trips they have taken for work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I was thinking about getting it on my forearm. I've heard that's not too painful of a spot. Thanks for sharing your experience with me, it's helpful to know what to expect.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several details about Speaker A's tattoos and their significance, particularly about honoring their late father, which is closely related to the ongoing discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about getting a tattoo for Speaker A's mom. However, it doesn't provide direct information on Speaker B's potential tattoo, fear of needles, or the specifics of the discussion about tattoo placement. Despite this, the information is presented clearly and narratively, which helps in understanding Speaker A's perspective and background related to tattoos, making it generally helpful for generating a relevant response. The mention of Speaker A working at a coffee shop is slightly less relevant but still adds context to their financial considerations when acquiring tattoos. Overall, the structure and flow make it relatively easy for a language model to discern what aspects are relevant during the conversation."
