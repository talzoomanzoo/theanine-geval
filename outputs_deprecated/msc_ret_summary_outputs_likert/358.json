Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing? Speaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel.\n2. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans.\n3. Speaker A does not have any pets and expresses an interest in scuba diving.\n4. Speaker B prefers animals to humans but acknowledges the importance of curing diseases.\n5. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n6. Speaker A is scared of sharks but finds the idea of going into a steel cage with them interesting.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! I can imagine how convenient it must be to have low-maintenance pets like snakes. I'm more of a scuba diving person myself, but I can see the appeal of having animals as companions.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides several relevant pieces of information that can be helpful for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The first memory sentence is directly related to what Speaker B just mentioned about their pet snakes, Hansel and Gretel, thus confirming that they indeed own two snakes by that name. This is critical because it allows Speaker A to connect their response to prior known facts about Speaker B's pets. Furthermore, sentence 4 about Speaker B preferring animals to humans, while acknowledging the importance of curing diseases, can provide depth to Speaker A's responses by linking this preference to their own understanding from prior exchanges.\n\nHowever, while sentence 3 (Speaker A's interest in scuba diving) and sentence 6 (fear of sharks) introduce elements of Speaker A's character, they are slightly tangential in this context. Sentence 5 contains information about Speaker A's future plans that is more relevant to a broad scope of discussion than specifically assessing the nature of Speaker B's snakes. Overall, despite these lighter relevance connections, the remaining structured past information provides a coherent basis for a likely response, hence a score of 4 is justified."
