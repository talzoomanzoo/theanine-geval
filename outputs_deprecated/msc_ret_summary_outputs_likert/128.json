    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships! Speaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!   I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field? Speaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate? Speaker B: I have another year- so this year is really important I get internships and start making connections in the field.   I love going to the beach too.  What happened with your knees that now cause you so much pain? Speaker A: I think age has really been my knees downfall. I also used to hike a lot and I put a lot of pressure on my legs. That is great that you only have a year. Maybe when you graduate you can come hang out on the beach with me. I can't surf but I would love to watch you. Speaker B: That would be fun!  I like collecting shells too so we could do that as well.  I have a small collection of ones I have from around the world.  The farthest away was from Greece.  Have you traveled a lot? Speaker A: I have. I love Europe. I have been to many countries there but I have not gone to Greece yet. I would love to. The scenery and architecture is amazing. Have you gotten to visit other European countries? Speaker B: I have.   I have also been to France and Ireland.  Where have you been in Europe? Speaker A: Oh gosh. I have been to France, England, Ireland, Switzerland, Austria, Poland, Germany, Leichenstein, Spain, and much of Mexico, and Bermuda. I just love to travel but I have not been able to recently and with my knees I cannot sit in coach anymore and first class is so expensive. Do you plan on settling any place in particular once you graduate?  Speaker B: That's awesome you have been so many places!   I  am not sure where I will setlle down after graduation.  It probably will depend whether I decide to go further in my education or not and I have any residency requirements with that.   I do like the heat though so  hopefully somewhere sunny!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys hiking along the coast and collecting shells, mentioning that their knees can't handle much else.\n2. Speaker A is offering advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field.\n3. Speaker B is interested in sports medicine and enjoys surfing.\n4. Speaker A suggests that surfing could be a way for Speaker B to make connections in the medical field.\n5. Speaker B is studying sports medicine and plays soccer, looking to join their college team in the future.\n6. Speaker B is looking for internships in the sports medicine field and has asked professors for letters of recommendation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It sounds like you have a lot of exciting options ahead of you. A sunny location sounds like a great choice, especially coming from someone who loves the beach! Just keep exploring your options and everything will fall into place.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly regarding Speaker B's interest in sports medicine and the search for internships. This information is useful for understanding Speaker B's goals and needs, which could help in generating responses related to internship opportunities. However, the memory entries are somewhat disjointed and lack clear connections or developments with each other and the context. For example, there is mention of surfing and soccer, but these activities are not linked to the dialogue context where they could have been relevant. Additionally, the MEMORY lacks references to key details from the dialogue such as travel experiences and knee issues. This restricts its overall helpfulness for generating contextually rich and accurate responses."
