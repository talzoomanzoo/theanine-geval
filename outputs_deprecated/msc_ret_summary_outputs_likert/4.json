Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet? Speaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there? Speaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay? Speaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately? Speaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n2. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\n3. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n4. Speaker B asks if the recommended book is fiction or nonfiction.\n5. Speaker A, a retired librarian, recommends the book \"Beautiful Ruins\" by Jess Walter for a beach visit.\n6. Both Speaker A's mother and Speaker A were librarians, but Speaker A is retired.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds interesting! I'll have to check that book out. I'm hoping to find some time to read on the beach in Costa Rica. Do you have any other historical fiction recommendations?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information that can help generate a response in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, it mentions Speaker B's excitement about spring break and Easter weekend, which aligns with Speaker B's travel plans to Costa Rica. Additionally, Speaker A's interest in books and their background as a retired librarian provides context to Speaker A's mention of historical fiction and nonfiction reading preferences. However, some details, such as the book recommendation and Speaker A's familial librarian history, are less connected to the current dialogue topic. The sentences are well-structured and provide a coherent background, making it easy for a language model to identify important cues for generating a response, but it could benefit from more direct contextual information specifically related to the conversational topic at hand."
