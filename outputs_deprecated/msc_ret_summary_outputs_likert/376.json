Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout.\n2. Speaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat.\n3. Speaker B is a member of the boy scouts and works at a fast food place\n4. Speaker B plans to earn the Eagle Scout badge for college applications.\n5. Speaker B is busy with scouts, school, work, and tennis, but willing to take vacation days for the retreat.\n6. Speaker B is not yet in college but hopes to become an Eagle Scout.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I have definitely learned a lot of survival skills through Boy Scouts. I've had the chance to practice setting up shelter and starting a fire with minimal materials. It's been a great experience.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides helpful information that could assist in generating a suitable response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It clearly indicates that Speaker B has been involved with the Boy Scouts for 7-8 years and is currently a Life Scout (#1), which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as it pertains to survival skills and Boy Scouts. Additionally, it mentions Speaker B's future plans to earn the Eagle Scout badge (#4 and #6), indicating a high level of commitment and expertise in Boy Scouts activities, which aligns with Speaker A's interest in survival skills. Furthermore, the MEMORY highlights Speaker B's busy schedule with scouts, school, work, and tennis (#5), showing their dedication and providing context for Speaker B's availability, which could be relevant to Speaker A's mention of their kids loving the idea of \"roughing it\". The MEMORY is well-structured and naturally connected, making it easy for the language model to extract contextually important information. However, some sentences like Speaker B working at a fast food place (#3) have less relevance to the context, which influences the score to be a 4 instead of a 5."
