Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know.  Speaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like. Speaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too. Speaker B: Nice! Is anyone coming with you? Speaker A: Just my doggy Drunky.  You never know,  I might meet a nice lady out there.  Speaker B: Totally.  There will be a bunch of women there and it'll be easy to strike up conversations.  Just be confident and I'm sure you could walk away with a bunch of numbers. Speaker A: Oh, I definitely will. Thanks for the motivation. Is this going to me your first festival? Speaker B: No, I used to go to them all the time.  This will be my first one in a while and probably my last since my wife and I are about to have our baby. Speaker A: You could make this one festival your \"escape\" every year. Don't give up the festivals, you need to have something to keep you happy.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n3. Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy.\n4. Speaker B dislikes public transportation and enjoys going to festivals, but misses doing so.\n5. Speaker A enjoys going to bars and loves the ladies.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provided does contain relevant information regarding Speaker B's situation and their attendance at the festival. In particular, memory point 1 about Speaker B's wife being pregnant and their consideration of attending a local festival for just a day, directly ties to the dialogue context. Also, memory point 6 about both speakers enjoying bluegrass music aligns with the discussion in the dialogue context about the bluegrass show. However, some memory points are not as directly connected to the current conversation (e.g., memory point 3 about Speaker B's jealousy or memory point 5 about Speaker A's fondness for bars and ladies) and do not offer immediate benefits for generating a next response. Additionally, memory points such as 2 and 4 offer potential context but are not directly relevant to any ongoing dialogue within the context provided. The memory is somewhat helpful but could be better aligned to enhance direct support for generating responses tied to the current dialogue context."
