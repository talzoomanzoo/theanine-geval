Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately? Speaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me. Speaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway? Speaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day! I'll make it as fun as possible. Speaker B: I will someday. just not in the summer when all the bugs are out! Where do you go hiking the most? Speaker A: I like to go hiking in the local trails here. I am familiar with them and there's so many routes that I can take. Sadly, the bugs are as bad here as they are anywhere else.....\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks.\n2. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n3. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking as free activities.\n4. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n5. Speaker A is nervous about the Appalachian Trail hike, as they don't usually do full day hikes.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy being outdoors, but Speaker B prefers the fresh air over being in the mud and rain.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I can imagine the bugs being a nuisance, but it sounds like you have everything prepared to handle them. Maybe I'll give it a try with you sometime, as long as we can avoid the bugs!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information but could have been more helpful for generating the next response. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. The MEMORY includes details about Speaker A's enjoyment of hiking and camping, which is consistent with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Speaker A mentions going on hikes. This information is helpful as it aligns with Speaker A's interests discussed in the dialogue.\n\n2. Speaker B's mention of recently going on a long hike (MEMORY 2) doesn't align with the dialogue context which portrays Speaker B as not being a fan of the outdoors and hesitant to join hikes. This inconsistency could confuse the language model.\n\n3. There's information on Speaker A's plans for the Appalachian Trail and their nervousness about it (MEMORY 4 and 5), which is relevant to their context of hiking but wasn't mentioned in the current dialogue. It might provide useful background for future contexts.\n\n4. It would be more helpful if MEMORY included insights into Speaker B's disinterest in hiking, which would better relate to the dialogue and help generate a more relevant response.\n\nOverall, MEMORY provides some helpful context, but it lacks clarity and has slight inconsistencies, therefore it cannot be rated very highly."
