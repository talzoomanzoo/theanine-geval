Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing? Speaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha! Speaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes? Speaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel.\n2. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans.\n3. Speaker A does not have any pets and expresses an interest in scuba diving.\n4. Speaker A is interested in scuba diving and neuroscience, with experience in a research lab.\n5. Speaker A's interest in neuroscience was further fueled by their experience in a research lab and being in the Eagle Scouts.\n6. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's fascinating! It's interesting to see how your passion for science extends beyond just your studies. Have you ever thought about studying reptiles in a research setting?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided offers some helpful cues relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically with regard to Speaker B's pet snakes, Hansel and Gretel, mentioned in sentence 1. This information directly ties into the conversation at hand, making it useful for generating further dialogue. The context of Speaker A's interests in neuroscience and scuba diving (sentences 3, 4, 5) could potentially guide future conversations but does not directly relate to the current dialogue about pet snakes. Sentences about Speaker A's plans (sentence 6) and their perspective on animals (sentence 2) do offer a glimpse into possible past interactions and Speaker A's character, but they are not directly connected to the immediate context. Overall, the memory contains sentences that are naturally phrased and demonstrate Speaker B and Speaker A's interests, but more direct connections to the specific discussion about snakes and reptiles would be beneficial for a higher score."
