Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully.\n2. Speaker A volunteers at a hospital and enjoys making origami crafts, specifically a 3D modular swan with glue.\n3. Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n4. Speaker B is interested in making origami animals and finds the idea cute.\n5. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next.\n6. Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY is partially helpful in generating a response to the provided DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Several points in the MEMORY, such as Speaker A's enjoyment and practice of origami (points 1, 2, 3), align with the context where Speaker A discusses winning an origami contest. These memories provide some background and establish a connection to Speaker A's accomplishment. Points 4 and 6 introduce an additional aspect of Speaker A's interactions with Speaker B, highlighting a shared interest and the possibility of further engagement with origami, which could be relevant for initiating a response that builds on this shared interest. However, the MEMORY could improve by focusing more on Speaker A's achievement in the contest and less on specific origami projects like the lotus flower (points 1 and 5). The connection is not as explicitly clear or directly relevant to the prize-winning event itself, which is the focal point of the dialogue context. Thus, while the MEMORY has relevant information, it could be structured in a way to better demonstrate the causality and relevance to Speaker A's recent accomplishment."
