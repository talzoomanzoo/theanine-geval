Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job! Speaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. Speaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist, mentioning the ups and downs of the profession.\n2. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n3. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n4. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n5. Speaker A works at a stable and enjoys being around horses.\n6. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "No, I haven't tried therapy before. I mainly work with horses and enjoy being around them. It's interesting to hear about your experiences as a therapist.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY generally provides helpful information for generating a response in the dialogue context. Several points in the MEMORY are directly relevant: \n\n1. Speaker B is a therapist, which aligns with their conversation about their career enjoyment in DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n3. Speaker B's experience, \"working in their own practice for about six years,\" underscores Speaker B's commitment and experience in therapy.\n\nWhile the parts about Speaker B's interest in football (item 2) and horses (item 4) are not necessary for responding to the current dialogue, they are phrased naturally and indicate broader interests outside therapy. They are not distracting and can be easily identified as less relevant for this specific turn in conversation. Items 5 and 6 about Speaker A relate to their knowledge and interests, possibly useful for future dialogue connections.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides useful context for understanding Speaker B's profile and could be helpful in shaping further conversation in a natural way. This type of contextual information could guide Speaker A's inquiry or comments in future dialogue turns, enhancing connectedness and relevance."
