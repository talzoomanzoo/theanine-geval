    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for. Speaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for? Speaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work? Speaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\n3. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n4. Speaker A is looking for a job and new camping gear, specifically a hammock.\n5. Speaker B's neighbor, John, is getting divorced and selling top-of-the-line camping gear.\n6. Speaker A will use the money earned from the store to buy the hammock online.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great that you found a side gig with John! It's always nice to have some extra cash coming in. Maybe I'll have to ask him about his side projects too.",
    "prediction": "3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but not all of it is directly helpful in generating the next response. The fact that Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store is evident and that Speaker A enjoys the location and people, aligns well with memory points 1 and 2. Meanwhile, memory points 4 and 6 relate to Speaker A's job application, as the income will be used to buy a hammock. These points connect to the context surrounding Speaker A's excitement about the job. \n\nAdditionally, memory point 5 about Speaker B's neighbor John aligns with Speaker B working with John on side projects mentioned in the dialogue context. However, memory points 3 and 5 provide less direct help in crafting the next line without additional context linking them to the ongoing conversation. Overall, the MEMORY is moderately helpful, connecting to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but with some elements that are not immediately useful or directly tied to the conversation at hand."
