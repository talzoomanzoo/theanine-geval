Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer? Speaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to? Speaker A: The museum has all sorts of galleries.  It has a sculpture garden outside.  I mostly like the impressionist paintings.  I like Van Gogh.  Was your concert outdoors?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys going to museums and trying different foods.\n2. Speaker A is interested in music concerts and planning a trip to Sao Paulo.\n3. Speaker A is planning to visit the Museum of Art of S達o Paulo next week with their boyfriend.\n4. Speaker B is waiting for bands to announce their summer tour schedule to plan which shows to attend.\n5. Speaker B recommends visiting the Museum of Art of S達o Paulo in the city.\n6. Speaker B enjoys living in the city for the accessibility to food and live music.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "No, it was indoors at a small venue. But I love outdoor concerts too. The atmosphere is always so lively and fun. I hope you have a great time at the art museum next week!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY contains information that could be helpful for generating responses, but its helpfulness is moderate. Sentences 1 and 6 provide general interests of Speaker A and Speaker B rather than specific past interactions, so they are less relevant to the current context. Sentences 2, 3, and 5 provide some context about Speaker A and B's interest in art and concerts, which align with the current dialogue about art museums and music concerts. Sentence 4 provides relevant information about Speaker B's intentions regarding concerts, which could be leveraged when discussing music further. Overall, the memory offers useful context, but its connections are not highly detailed or strongly related to the development of the current dialogue."
