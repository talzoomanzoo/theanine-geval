Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone?  Speaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!). Speaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol Speaker B: I am up for the challenge! I have a few tricks up my sleeve to deal with people like you. Speaker A: Oh geez that makes me sound difficult.lol  Do you have any new speeches coming up?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks.\n2. Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600.\n3. Speaker B's job involves motivating people to be successful and follow their dreams.\n4. Speaker B has run a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding.\n5. Speaker B got into motivational speaking because they needed it themselves to battle depression and anxiety.\n6. Speaker A is a runner who is working on improving their mile time and training for a marathon.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes context about Speaker B's profession as a motivational speaker, which directly relates to Speaker A's inquiry about motivational speakers and the subsequent application by Speaker B. MEMORY points 1 and 3 are highly pertinent as they highlight Speaker B's experience and role as a motivational speaker, fitting well with the dialogue theme. Points 4 and 5 provide background on Speaker B's personal journey and experience with marathons, enriching the dialogue with potential topics for Speaker B to draw inspiration from when discussing motivational speaking. Point 6 adds context about Speaker A's interest in running, which ties back to their motivation conversation. However, point 2 is somewhat disconnected from the direct context of the DIALOGUE, though it adds background information on the speakers' shared interests. Overall, MEMORY effectively connects past interactions and supplies useful context for generating an appropriate continuation of the conversation."
