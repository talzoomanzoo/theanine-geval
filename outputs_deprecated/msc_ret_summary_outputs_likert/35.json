Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well? Speaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes? Speaker A: I want to take some martial art classes at school next year. What do you sggest I try?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B signed up for classes at the local college and has a background in football and karate.\n2. Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work.\n3. Speaker B practices karate and works as a lifeguard but is looking for a different career.\n4. Speaker B attends football games at their old high school and finds that their football background helps in karate footwork.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B both have interests in learning new languages.\n6. Speaker A has taken Spanish classes in the past and finds similarities between French and Spanish.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I think you should definitely give karate a try since you already have an interest in it. It'll be a great way to build on your skills and techniques.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it mentions that Speaker B has a background in karate (item 1) and holds a green belt (item 2), which establishes credibility when discussing martial arts. This information helps understand Speaker B's perspective and expertise when suggesting martial art classes to Speaker A. However, many other memory items focus on unrelated topics, such as football, language learning, and career plans, which do not directly aid in shaping a response concerning martial arts classes. Some irrelevant sentences are included, making it less helpful overall. Although the included information does offer a bit of context, a more concentrated focus on martial arts within the MEMORY would have warranted a higher score."
