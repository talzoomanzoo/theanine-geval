Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately? Speaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me. Speaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway? Speaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day! I'll make it as fun as possible. Speaker B: I will someday. just not in the summer when all the bugs are out! Where do you go hiking the most?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks.\n2. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n3. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking as free activities.\n4. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n5. Speaker A enjoys hiking, birdwatching, and spotting rare animals.\n6. Speaker A is nervous about the Appalachian Trail hike, as they don't usually do full day hikes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I usually hike in local parks and trails nearby. But this summer, I'm planning to do a section of the Appalachian Trail. It's a bit nerve-wracking for me, but I'm excited for the challenge!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful information regarding Speaker A's interest in hiking and camping, which is relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A discusses a recent hiking trip. Sentences 1, 3, 4, and 5 support Speaker A's enthusiasm and experience in hiking, which aligns with the conversation about hiking trips. However, sentence 2 is incorrect as it contradicts Speaker B's statement that they are not a fan of the outdoors, which can mislead the language model. Sentence 6 provides a detail about a specific future hike (Appalachian Trail) that is not directly related to the immediate context but could be useful for future conversations. Overall, the MEMORY includes relevant information but also has irrelevant or contradicting details, preventing it from achieving a perfect score."
