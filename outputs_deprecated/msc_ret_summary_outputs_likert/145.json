Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself! Speaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food? Speaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too? Speaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also? Speaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid.\n2. Speaker A mentions having dogs and Speaker B admires them for their peaceful nature.\n3. Speaker B has two terrier dogs as pets.\n4. Speaker A's pet raccoon enjoys eating pizza.\n5. Speaker B asks Speaker A if they have had a pet raccoon before.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B share a love for music and plan to have a house concert with their pets.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "They're doing great, thanks for asking! They're always full of energy and keep me on my toes. It sounds like Journey and Sid definitely have their own unique personalities too. It's going to be so much fun having a house concert with all our pets together!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, sentence 1 provides essential context about Speaker A's pets, Journey and Sid, which are directly referenced in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 4 offers particularly relevant information about Journey's behavior, supporting Speaker A's description in the context. However, sentences 2 and 6 are less relevant and do not provide critical context necessary for continuing the conversation about the pets and their behavior. The remaining sentences contain useful background about the speakers' pets but don't provide new insights that directly advance the conversation in the current dialogue. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it included more details about past interactions or behaviors directly related to food-related incidents with their pets. Despite this, the natural phrasing helps distinguish which parts are immediately useful."
