Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes.  Speaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n2. Speaker B works at a Raccoon Cafe and takes care of Bandicoot, a raccoon.\n3. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly.\n4. Speaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n5. Speaker B considers raccoons intelligent and funny.\n6. Speaker A has not interacted closely with raccoons but admires them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I never thought about befriending them like that. I'll keep that in mind for the future. Thanks for the tip! Good luck with Bandicoot at work.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a next response in the context of the dialogue. The points in the MEMORY effectively summarize past interactions and speaker characteristics that are relevant to the current conversation. They highlight Speaker A's issue with raccoons and their plan to use aluminum sheeting, which directly connects to the ongoing dialogue about managing the raccoon problem. Additionally, MEMORY points out Speaker B's experience with raccoons, particularly at a Raccoon Cafe and with Bandicoot, an intelligent raccoon, indicating their perspective and capacity to offer advice or insights. The MEMORY is structured in a way that maintains the development and relevance of information, aiding comprehension and response generation for the language model."
