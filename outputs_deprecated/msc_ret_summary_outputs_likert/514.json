Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids? Speaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call! Speaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand. Speaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip?  Speaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery Speaker B: Yes I think that's a great idea, how is work at the library?  Speaker A: Busy, and demanding because we are short staffed. While there seems to be little need for a library these days, I find that we have less staff to get everything done\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n2. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n3. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n4. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n5. Speaker A is a retired librarian who enjoys implementing creative activities in their library.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B both acknowledge the decline in interest and use of libraries due to the rise of the internet.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's a shame to hear about the decline in interest in libraries, especially with all the effort you put into creative activities. Maybe we can find a way to incorporate some of those activities into our annual fishing trip to get the grandkids more interested in nature and learning at the same time.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be helpful for generating a response in this dialogue context. Key points from the MEMORY include:\n\n1. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature. This directly connects with the conversation about the fishing trip.\n2. Speaker A is busy with work, which is mentioned in the context when Speaker A talks about the demanding library work.\n3. Speaker B enjoys spending time with their grandkids, which ties into the current conversation about interacting with grandchildren.\n\nHowever, some of the sentences in the MEMORY do not directly relate to the specific dialogue context, such as:\n- Speaker A being a retired librarian and enjoying implementing creative activities does not add much to the current conversation about the fishing trip or texting with grandchildren.\n\nThe rating is not higher because while there are some relevant connections, the MEMORY could be more concise and focused on the specific ongoing topics in the dialogue."
