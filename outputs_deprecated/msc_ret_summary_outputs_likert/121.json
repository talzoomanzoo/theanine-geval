Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships! Speaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!   I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field? Speaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is offering advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field.\n2. Speaker B is looking for internships in the sports medicine field and has asked professors for letters of recommendation.\n3. Speaker B is interested in sports medicine and enjoys surfing.\n4. Speaker A suggests that surfing could be a way for Speaker B to make connections in the medical field.\n5. Speaker B is studying sports medicine and plays soccer, looking to join their college team in the future.\n6. Speaker B's professors have been supportive in writing letters for an internship application.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I have about a year left until graduation. I'm really looking forward to potentially joining my college's soccer team as well. It's been a dream of mine to combine my passion for sports with my studies in sports medicine.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The memory contains several sentences that provide useful context information for generating a response in the dialogue. Specifically, sentences about Speaker B's interest in sports medicine, their pursuit of internships, and the support from professors are relevant to the current dialogue context, where Speaker B is being offered internship information. Additionally, details such as Speaker B's interest in surfing and playing soccer enrich the background knowledge, potentially helping in creating a more personalized and engaging response. However, some sentences seem redundant or less directly tied to the immediate dialogue context, preventing the memory from scoring a perfect 5. Overall, the memory is well-structured and provides valuable context, making it helpful for the language model."
