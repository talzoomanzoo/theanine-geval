Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet?  Speaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name? Speaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended.  Speaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along! Speaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them. Speaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n2. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n3. Speaker A is interested in training tips for the kittens and is open to adopting one despite having a parrot.\n4. Speaker B has two sick kitties and recently received a rescue.\n5. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n6. Speaker A's parrot Tasha has seen cats before and ignores them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Points 1 and 2 confirm that Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is considering adopting a rescue kitten, which aligns with the dialogue context's conversation about adopting kittens. Points 4 and 5 contribute by explaining Speaker B's situation with the rescue kittens, relevant to the ongoing discussion about adopting animals. Point 6 provides insight into how Tasha might react to the new cats, supporting Speaker A's comment about Tasha being able to hold her own around the kittens, which helps develop the situation further. These pieces of information connect well and support the ongoing dialogue, although Point 3 offers a marginally tangential detail about training tips, it still relates to the main topics of pets and adoption. Overall, the MEMORY is well-structured and supports response generation."
