Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice.  Speaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with? Speaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work.\n2. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker.\n3. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n4. Speaker A recommends the pressure cooker for its efficiency and ease of use, suggesting it to Speaker B.\n5. Speaker A has given a pressure cooker as a gift and uses it for recipes like lamb shanks.\n6. Speaker A primarily cooks Indian food and bakes a lot of rice dishes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great idea! I'll definitely give it a try. Thank you for the suggestion.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It informs that Speaker B's husband enjoys making Asian food, which aligns with the context of suggesting Asian recipes. This background detail supports the conversation about trying recipes, especially concerning the shrimp fried rice suggestion. Additionally, Speaker B's interest in learning to use a pressure cooker and Speaker A's expertise in using one is clear, demonstrating the development of the dialogue around cooking with a pressure cooker. However, some details about the specific dishes Speaker A cooks or gifting a pressure cooker, while connected contextually, might not be immediately relevant to generating the next response. The information is structured in a way that provides a good amount of relevant background without irrelevant or confusing details, supporting the flow of the conversation."
