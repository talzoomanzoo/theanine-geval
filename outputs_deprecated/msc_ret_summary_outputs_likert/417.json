Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it? Speaker B: Yes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see.  Speaker A: I definitely will, this sounds like such an amazing trip. How long has it been since you've been there yourself? Speaker B: I was in Greece last two years ago.   I am excited to go again soon!    At somepoint I would like to take a cruise around the islands there.  It seems like a neat way to see all the Islands in an easy way.   Have you ever taken a cruise? Speaker A: Only once before when I was very young, so I don't remember much. It sounds like such a relaxing way to enjoy the day, though. Maybe we can plan a cruise together sometime. Speaker B: That would be fun!  I go to Europe a lot so maybe a cruise in the Caribbean would be nice.  I would like to see Saint Lucia and Saint Thomas.  Speaker A: Oh, Europe? I'm already sold on the idea, sounds like a blast! I've never had a negative experience in Europe. Should we visit some of the capital cities? Speaker B: I would like to go to Paris.  Since I live in Amsterdam I could take the train down.  I have seen much and Italy and Greece but would love to go to Paris.  Have you been there before?  Speaker A: Only once, and I had a really great time there. The buildings were so beautiful and the food was delicious. Do you like French food?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has traveled around Europe before, visiting capital cities of each country.\n2. Speaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five.\n3. Speaker B and their kids are excited about their upcoming trip to Greece.\n4. Speaker B recommends visiting the Parthenon, Acropolis of Athens, and the beach on Corfu Island in Greece.\n5. Speaker A's favorite cities from the trip were Rome, Berlin, Madrid, and Helsinki.\n6. Speaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I love French food! Croissants, escargot, and macarons are some of my favorites. I can't wait to indulge in all the delicious dishes Paris has to offer when we visit.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some details about Speaker B's travel plans and recommendations for Greece, but these details are not fully aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While the DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses on a discussion about the Acropolis in Athens, potential future trips, and past travel experiences in Europe, the MEMORY mentions Speaker B planning a trip with their family and recommending various sites in Greece, which are somewhat relevant. However, the MEMORY contains inaccurate or conflicting information, such as stating that Speaker B is visiting Greece for the first time, while the DIALOGUE CONTEXT indicates they have been there before. Additional unrelated information, like Athena being the perfect goddess for a librarian, does not enhance the flow or relevance of past interactions. The MEMORY lacks the cohesion and direct relevance to the ongoing discussion needed for a higher helpfulness score."
