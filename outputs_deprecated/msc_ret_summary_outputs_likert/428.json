Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone?  Speaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better.

We have an iron-clad written agreement. Tell me how I'm doing so far. Is this the most motivated you've ever been in your entire life? Speaker A: No, but that's why I have you.  You're going to push me to do the things I can't bring myself to do.  I'll have more motivation tomorrow.  Today was a long work day.lol\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600.\n2.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information about the relationship between Speaker A and Speaker B and the context of their conversation. Specifically, it notes that Speaker A is training for a marathon and offers motivation, which aligns with Speaker B's role as a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to inspire people. Furthermore, MEMORY details that Speaker B has run a marathon before and found it rewarding, which might help in motivating Speaker A. It also highlights Speaker B's personal experience with depression and anxiety, which could provide context for their empathetic approach in helping Speaker A. Overall, the MEMORY is well-structured and connected, clearly demonstrating the shared goals and past interactions between both speakers. However, a perfect score is not awarded because some elements, such as meeting at the beach or Speaker B's specific background, may not directly relate to the immediate DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Nonetheless, the memory is helpful and provides a comprehensive overview of Speaker B's motivational role in Speaker A's marathon training journey."
