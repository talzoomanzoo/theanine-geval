Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume. Speaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment.  Speaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon? Speaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks.\n2. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully.\n3. Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n4. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next.\n5. Speaker B is interested in making origami animals and finds the idea cute.\n6. Speaker A volunteers at a hospital and enjoys making origami crafts, specifically a 3D modular swan with glue.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I think origami can be both easy and challenging, depending on the complexity of the design you're trying to create. But with practice and patience, anyone can learn and enjoy it! I'd be happy to teach you some basic origami techniques and we can work our way up to more intricate designs like the lotus flower I recently made.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains mostly relevant information for generating a proper next response. Sentences 1 and 5 directly connect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, providing continuity and context to the interaction between the speakers about teaching and learning origami. The pieces of information presented are mostly presented in a natural and connected manner, indicating past interactions and shared interests, which helps build an understanding of the speakers' relationship and activities. However, sentences 2, 3, and 4, while informative, could have been more helpful if they had better connections to Speaker B's statements in the dialogue context. Nevertheless, these sentences were clearly presented and do not cause confusion. This MEMORY has a good level of cohesiveness and relevance, with one or two points that could be made slightly clearer or more connected for maximum benefit."
