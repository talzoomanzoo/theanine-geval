Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes.\n2. Speaker A learned how to make jello from their grandma, turning it into a family tradition.\n3. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n4. Speaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners.\n5. Speaker A is eating their favorite jello.\n6. Speaker B also enjoys jello, with cherry being their favorite flavor as well.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provided is quite helpful for generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memory entries provide a clear connection between Speaker A and Speaker B's interest in jello, which is relevant to the current dialogue topic where Speaker B talks about passing on a jello recipe. The memory highlights Speaker A's family tradition related to jello, which mirrors Speaker B's intentions, allowing Speaker A to relate personally and share experiences or thoughts on the matter. Additionally, it introduces a potential bond over their shared favorite flavor (cherry), offering Speaker A common ground for a response. However, some memory details, such as Speaker A eating their favorite jello, do not actively contribute to the specific context of passing down recipes, preventing a perfect score. The entries are well-structured and natural, maintaining coherence and relevance to the context."
