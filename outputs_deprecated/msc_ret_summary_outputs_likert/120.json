Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships! Speaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!   I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is offering advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field.\n2. Speaker B is looking for internships in the sports medicine field and has asked professors for letters of recommendation.\n3. Speaker A suggests that surfing could be a way for Speaker B to make connections in the medical field.\n4. Speaker B is studying sports medicine and plays soccer, looking to join their college team in the future.\n5. Speaker B is interested in sports medicine and enjoys surfing.\n6. Speaker B's professors have been supportive in writing letters for an internship application.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I work as a nurse at the hospital nearby. It's a demanding but rewarding job. Surfing can be a great way for you to meet people in the medical field and make connections. Have you considered reaching out to any local sports medicine clinics or teams for internship opportunities?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for generating a following response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Points 1 and 2 specifically align with the context of internships and the medical field, which connects well to the dialogue about Speaker B's challenges in finding an internship. While point 3 about surfing connections is somewhat off-topic, points 4 and 5 (sports medicine and personal interests) enrich the context by providing background on Speaker B's interests and aspirations, which can be valuable in crafting a meaningful response. Point 6 reinforces Speaker B's proactive efforts toward securing an internship, enhancing the dialogue's continuity. Overall, the memory is relatively cohesive and contributes useful insights related to the ongoing conversation."
