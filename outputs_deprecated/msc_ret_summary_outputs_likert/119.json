    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is looking for internships in the sports medicine field and has asked professors for letters of recommendation.\n2. Speaker A is offering advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field.\n3. Speaker B's professors have been supportive in writing letters for an internship application.\n4. Speaker B is studying sports medicine and plays soccer, looking to join their college team in the future.\n5. Speaker B is struggling with finding internships and feels like they are at a disadvantage compared to others with connections.\n6. Speaker A is interested in getting tips from locals and knows someone named John who could help.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's awesome, thank you so much for the offer! I'll definitely reach out to them and see if they have any opportunities available. Having connections in the field can really make a difference in finding the right internship.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides fairly relevant and helpful information for generating a suitable response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context concerns a potential internship opportunity, and MEMORY contains several points directly linked to Speaker B's search for internships in the sports medicine field (e.g., points 1, 4, and 5). These points also demonstrate the development of Speaker B's situation, such as their struggles with finding internships and efforts like obtaining letters of recommendation. Additionally, the phrasing of these points is clear and naturally structured, which benefits a language model in understanding the context. However, points 2 and 6 about Speaker A's advice and connections do not strongly connect to the immediate context of passing on internship info, slightly reducing the score from a perfect 5. Overall, the MEMORY provides a coherent and useful backdrop for the current dialogue."
