Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes.  Speaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me. Speaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house.  Speaker B: Understandable. Have you ever tried contacting animal control? That's how I got Bandicoot. I was working that day and animal control came by explaining about needing fosters for raccoons. I thought it was weird, so I did it and began to work at the small raccoon cafe that is part of the zoo. I love it.  Speaker A: That is a good idea.  Maybe they could help move them to a safer area.  I have a lot of traffic around and they could get hit if they are coming to my place all the time.  Have you been able to teach your raccoon any tricks?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B works at a Raccoon Cafe and takes care of Bandicoot, a raccoon.\n2. Speaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n3. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly.\n4. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n5. Speaker A has not interacted closely with raccoons but admires them.\n6. Speaker B considers raccoons intelligent and funny.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I've been working on teaching Bandicoot a few tricks. Raccoons are really clever, so they catch on quickly. I've managed to teach him to high-five and even to fetch small objects. It's been a fun learning experience for both of us.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information that aligns well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The first sentence summarizes Speaker B's involvement with raccoons, which is featured in the context and contributes to an understanding of why Speaker B suggests befriending raccoons. Sentences 2 and 3 further elaborate on Speaker B's relationship with raccoons and their views, offering helpful context for the discussion about handling raccoons. Sentence 4 is directly relevant as it mentions Speaker A's plan to use aluminum sheeting, bringing coherence to the current situation. Sentence 5, while adding some context to Speaker A's stance on raccoons, is slightly less helpful as it does not add significant value in terms of contextualizing the current discussion but is still naturally phrased. Sentence 6 underscores Speaker B's views on raccoon intelligence, providing additional background during the conversation. Overall, the MEMORY is largely helpful, with naturally structured sentences that support the ongoing dialogue."
