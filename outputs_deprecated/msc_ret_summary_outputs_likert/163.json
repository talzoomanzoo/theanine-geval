Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B shared tips on repelling mosquitos using sprays with 20% DEET and other active ingredients.\n2. Speaker B gets scared by bugs and creepy crawlies in the outdoors.\n3. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n4. Speaker A is a personal trainer who loves camping in remote areas.\n5. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n6. Speaker B dislikes bugs and is not a fan of camping, hiking, or the outdoors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! It's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to those pesky bugs. I hope the repellent works well for you on your camping trips.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several relevant pieces of information that can help generate a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Firstly, Sentence 1 directly connects with the conversation about mosquito repellents, indicating that Speaker B had previously shared tips on this topic. This is valuable as it gives context to Speaker A's action of using repellent. Sentence 6 also aligns well as it provides Speaker B's dislike for bugs and the outdoors, which complements the topic of using mosquito repellent. Sentence 2 reinforces Speaker B's aversion to bugs. Sentence 3 and 4 about Speaker A's camping plans and background as a personal trainer are related, providing context to why Speaker A might be taking Speaker B's advice seriously and preparing for the outdoors. Sentence 5, while related to hiking, does not strongly connect to the current dialogue about mosquito repellents. Overall, the sentences are naturally structured and provide a clear picture of the dynamics between the two speakers, making it easier for the language model to generate a relevant response."
