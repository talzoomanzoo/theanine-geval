Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer? Speaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to? Speaker A: The museum has all sorts of galleries.  It has a sculpture garden outside.  I mostly like the impressionist paintings.  I like Van Gogh.  Was your concert outdoors? Speaker B: Yes. That way they could have a fireworks show too. I love fireworks. Have you ever seen the fireworks at the Disney castle? Speaker A: No, but I have been to Disney World in Florida.  I love fireworks too.  I want to get married on the 4th of July.  That was we will have a national holiday and fireworks for us every year!  It sounds like you've been to Disneyland? Speaker B: No, but I thought you might have since you lived in LA for awhile. Did you get to see any live Disney music performances while you were at Disney World? Speaker A: No, we rode a lot of rides that broke down.  We had to be rescued from the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.  It was stuck.  Someone put on waders and pushed us to the side to climb out. Speaker B: Oh no! Hopefully your trip to the art museum is much better than that. Did your boyfriend go to Disney World too?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A loves Disney music.\n2. Speaker A enjoys going to museums and trying different foods.\n3. Speaker A is planning to visit the Museum of Art of São Paulo next week with their boyfriend.\n4. Speaker A is interested in music concerts and planning a trip to Sao Paulo.\n5. Speaker A and their boyfriend also look forward to having some refreshing beers by the beach.\n6. Speaker A plans to do lots of shopping during their trip.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information about Speaker A's interests in both music concerts and museums, which aligns with the topics discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, MEMORY items 2 and 4 hint at Speaker A's interest in going to museums and music, which correspond with the subjects of art museums and concerts in the dialogue. However, the MEMORY doesn't contain specific information about the current conversation, such as the fireworks, Disney World experiences, or specific artworks, which would make it more directly useful. Additionally, details about a trip to São Paulo or shopping plans, as mentioned in MEMORY items 3 and 6, are not directly relevant or helpful to generating responses for this specific context. The MEMORY provides some background information but lacks direct relevancy and connectedness to the specific dialogue exchanged, hence a score of 2."
