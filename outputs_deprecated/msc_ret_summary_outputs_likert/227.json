    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods. Speaker B: Oh that sounds fun! What is it about? Speaker A: Black Widow is one of the character in the Marvel Avengers movies. Like Thor and Captain America. Have you seen any of those movies? Speaker B: No I haven't seen any of those. What foods did you eat while watching the movie? Speaker A: Wow, there are so many of the movies out there. Don't go see Black Widow without watching Avengers first. I had an amazing steak and vegetables on the side that were delicious. What is you favorite food?  Speaker B: Oh ok I definitely will watch those first! I love both steak and vegetables! I am a real foodie and love just about everything that isn't too strange to try lol. Speaker A: Oh wow! Do you like sushi? I love it but the sea urchin is a little crazy lol. Have you ever eaten sea urchin? Speaker B: I have never tried sea urchin or sushi but I do like crab legs and shrimp! Do you ever consider any foods to be good for healing? I find that you do healing very fascinating! Speaker A: Yes, in fact I consider almost all foods to either be healing, harmful or neutral. In my opinion people should choose foods based on how they want to feel. Sushi is fresh and healthy so I considerate it to be very healing. Speaker B: That is very wise thinking. Which vegetables do you feel are the best for healing? Are there any that should be avoided?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B expressed interest in trying healing methods mentioned by Speaker A.\n2. Speaker A recommended self-massage, essential oils, reiki, meditation, and self-awareness for healing.\n3. Speaker A is involved in healing work and mentioned hot latina salsa.\n4. Speaker A's brother enjoys Brazilian food, specifically steak.\n5. Speaker A and their brother enjoy going to a Brazilian steakhouse for dinner.\n6. Speaker A finds being on the water therapeutic and relaxing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I find that leafy greens like kale and spinach are really great for healing due to their high nutrient content. On the other hand, processed foods and sugary snacks should definitely be avoided for optimal healing.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information that can inform the dialogue context but lacks direct relevancy to the ongoing conversation. Sentences 1, 2, and 3 provide insights into Speaker A's interest and involvement in healing, which aligns with the ongoing discussion about foods and their healing properties in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, this connection is not explicitly about foods, so the link is somewhat indirect. Sentences 4 and 5 relate to Brazilian food, which was part of the conversation's initial parts, though more about Speaker A's experiences than a direct continuity of the current talk about healing foods. Sentence 6 is not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as it talks about Speaker Aâ€™s personal experiences unrelated to healing or Brazilian food. Thus, while MEMORY provides a background understanding of Speaker A's interests and some shared topics, it doesn't wholly support the specific context of the current discussion."
