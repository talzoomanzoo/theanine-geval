Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships! Speaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!   I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field? Speaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate? Speaker B: I have another year- so this year is really important I get internships and start making connections in the field.   I love going to the beach too.  What happened with your knees that now cause you so much pain?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is offering advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field.\n2. Speaker B is looking for internships in the sports medicine field and has asked professors for letters of recommendation.\n3. Speaker B is interested in sports medicine and enjoys surfing.\n4. Speaker A suggests that surfing could be a way for Speaker B to make connections in the medical field.\n5. Speaker A enjoys hiking along the coast and collecting shells, mentioning that their knees can't handle much else.\n6. Speaker B is studying sports medicine and plays soccer, looking to join their college team in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's great that you have a clear plan for your last year. As for my knees, years of hiking and collecting shells along the coast took a toll on them. But it's all worth it for the memories and the joy it brought me. Just be careful with your own physical activities, especially with soccer and surfing. Your health is important too.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several relevant pieces of information that can assist in generating the next response for Speaker A in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, MEMORY points 2 and 6 align with Speaker B's interest and studies in sports medicine, providing information relevant to the dialogue topic. Points 1 and 4 relate to Speaker A offering guidance and suggesting potential networking strategies in the medical field. Additionally, point 5 connects to Speaker A's activities and physical limitations, which ties back to the context of Speaker A's mention of enjoying the beach due to knee pain. Overall, the MEMORY is mostly relevant and provides a coherent description of the interactions between the two speakers, assisting in the continuation of the conversation. However, some information, such as surfing in point 3 and soccer in point 6, while useful for context, doesn't immediately aid in generating the next response in the dialogue context given."
