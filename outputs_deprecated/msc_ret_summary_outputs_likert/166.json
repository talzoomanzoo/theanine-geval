Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately? Speaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me. Speaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n2. Speaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks.\n3. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking as free activities.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy being outdoors, but Speaker B prefers the fresh air over being in the mud and rain.\n5. Speaker A is nervous about the Appalachian Trail hike, as they don't usually do full day hikes.\n6. Speaker B dislikes bugs and is not a fan of camping, hiking, or the outdoors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "They did! Even though they were tired, they really enjoyed the fresh air and the beautiful scenery. It was a fun day out for all of us.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant points, but many of the sentences are contradictory and confusing, making it less helpful for generating a proper next response. For instance, point 1 states that Speaker B enjoyed a long hike, yet point 6 contradicts this by stating that Speaker B dislikes hiking and the outdoors. Additionally, the MEMORY indicates that Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking (points 2 and 3), which is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as Speaker A led friends on a hike. However, points 4 and 5 introduce incorrect information about Speaker B enjoying the outdoors and Speaker A being nervous about full day hikes, which don't align with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, the MEMORY contains relevant information in some places but lacks clarity and coherence, decreasing its helpfulness."
