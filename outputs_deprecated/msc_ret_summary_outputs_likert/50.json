Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job. Speaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career. Speaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday. Speaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud. Speaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach? Speaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option. Speaker A: Yes I think history is interesting, too! Both of those subjects would be great because there are probably lots of teaching jobs. What kind of history do you like?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\n3. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n4. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n5. Speaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\n6. Speaker A is studying computer science and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm really drawn to ancient history, especially the Mediterranean civilizations like Greece and Rome. It's fascinating to learn about how they lived and the impact they had on the world.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that could aid in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes Speaker A's interest in teaching computer science, specifically robotics, which aligns with their mention of wanting to teach robotics someday in the context. Additionally, it highlights Speaker B's focus on linguistics and future plans, which closely relate to the discussion on potential teaching subjects like English and interests in history. However, the details seem a bit scattered, as it does not directly address the recent consideration of history as an interest. The information about job limitations, a master's degree, and Speaker A's job at the pizza shop feel less directly relevant to the immediate conversation regarding teaching history or English. While the MEMORY contains useful elements, the connections and causality between the past interactions and the current dialogue could be more explicitly articulated to achieve a higher score."
