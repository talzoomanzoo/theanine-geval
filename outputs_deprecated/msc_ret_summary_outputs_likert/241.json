Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company? Do you build computers or work on programming? Speaker B: I do like my job. My job is to troubleshoot issues between the hardware and software, so I get to work with both.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B works for a computer company and is unable to change careers until their child graduates.\n2. Speaker A enjoys reading books about ice cream, Disney World, and computers.\n3. Speaker A works for a small local business with a demanding schedule.\n4. Speaker A is considering a career in dentistry but is also interested in working at Disney for happiness.\n5. Speaker A considers quitting their job to work at Disney World.\n6. Speaker A is torn between choosing a career in dentistry for the money or working at Disney for happiness.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains information that is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but lacks a direct connection to fully support Speaker A in generating a proper next response. While MEMORY contains information about Speaker B working for a computer company, and possibly considering a career change after their child graduates, it does not specifically address the aspects of the dialogue regarding Speaker B's job responsibilities or interests. \n\nInformation about Speaker A's interests and career considerations could indirectly influence the dialogue, providing context on Speaker A's interests that might align with Speaker B's job if expanded upon. However, this requires the language model to make more assumptions than would be ideal. \n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides relevant but underdeveloped context that focuses more on Speaker A's life situations and choices, while the dialogue itself centers on Speaker B's job satisfaction. Therefore, the connections within MEMORY do not strongly enable the generation of a focused next response for Speaker B. Even though the relevant context concerning Speaker B is present, it is not directly useful for crafting a next response in this specific dialogue context."
