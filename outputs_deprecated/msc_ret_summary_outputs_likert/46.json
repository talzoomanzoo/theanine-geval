Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job. Speaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career. Speaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\n3. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n4. Speaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\n5. Speaker A is studying computer science and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth.\n6. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Several sentences within the MEMORY directly relate to the conversation between Speaker A and Speaker B.\n\n1. Sentence 2 and Sentence 6 offer crucial information about Speaker B's academic background in linguistics, which is directly related to Speaker B's career uncertainty mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n2. Sentence 3 provides additional details about Speaker Bâ€™s career trajectory considerations, including becoming a college professor, which ties into the ongoing discussion about career planning.\n3. Sentences 1, 4, and 5 provide context on Speaker A's background and interests, specifically their studies in computer science and a potential career in teaching, aligning with their expressed interest in teaching robotics.\n\nThese sentences form a coherent narrative that elucidates the past interaction and concerns of both speakers regarding career paths, further enhancing the effectiveness of the dialogue generation. While not all sentences are directly related to the immediate conversation, they are naturally structured and still beneficial for understanding the overarching context, which is why the MEMORY does not receive a perfect score. However, the MEMORY effectively demonstrates connections and causality, thus warranting a high score."
