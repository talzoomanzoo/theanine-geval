Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college? Speaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position.  Speaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it? Speaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days.  Speaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living. Speaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime? Speaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play. Speaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with. Speaker A: Sounds great! Now the tough question: when do you have time? Speaker B: It would have to be sometime when I'm off work, maybe on the weekend. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n2. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.\n3. Speaker A enjoys playing soccer but is not into music.\n4. Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n5. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n6. Speaker A is a fan of Arsenal and enjoys watching international teams play.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains several pieces of information that are helpful for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, points 1, 2, and 4 regarding Speaker A provide useful context about Speaker A's current involvement in soccer, their role as a striker, and their recent performance, which could inform potential plans or discussions about playing soccer on the field together. Point 5 gives insight into Speaker B's soccer background and their support for Manchester United, which helps to explain Speaker B's interest in joining in casual play. \n\nWhile point 3 (Speaker A not into music) and point 6 (Speaker A's support for Arsenal and international teams) do not directly connect to the immediate conversation about playing soccer together, they are still naturally structured and provide context on Speaker A's interests that could be relevant in other parts of the conversation. \n\nOverall, the MEMORY effectively outlines the relevant interactions and backgrounds concerning the speakers' shared interest in soccer, which is the main topic in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, hence supporting a high score of 4."
