Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company? Do you build computers or work on programming?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B works for a computer company and is unable to change careers until their child graduates.\n2. Speaker A enjoys reading books about ice cream, Disney World, and computers.\n3. Speaker A works for a small local business with a demanding schedule.\n4. Speaker A considers quitting their job to work at Disney World.\n5. Speaker A is 27 years old and hopes to change careers soon.\n6. Speaker A is considering a career in dentistry but is also interested in working at Disney for happiness.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response by Speaker A, but it is not entirely cohesive. The following points can be considered:\n\n1. Relevant Information: Memories 2, 4, and 6 provide information related to Speaker A's interests and career considerations, which could be relevant to the question asked by Speaker B about the job at the computer company. Memory 2 establishes an interest in computers, which is directly related to the context. Memories 4 and 6 provide insights into Speaker A's career aspirations, which can be useful for generating a response about career satisfaction or future plans.\n\n2. Additional Context: While Memories 1, 3, and 5 provide contextual information about Speaker B's circumstances and Speaker A's current job and age, these are less directly connected to the specific question about the computer company job. \n\n3. Structure and Cohesion: The MEMORY lacks a clear development or causality related specifically to the context, making it less effective in providing a cohesive background for generating a response. While individual points are naturally phrased, they are not always connected to the specific topic of the dialogue context.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides some relevant cues and natural phrasing, but it could be more focused and cohesive regarding the dialogue context to enhance its helpfulness."
