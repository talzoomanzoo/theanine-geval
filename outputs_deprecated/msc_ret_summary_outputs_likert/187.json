Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam? Speaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has been getting all A's in the sports medicine class.\n2. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n3. Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring.\n4. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n5. Speaker A wishes to get better grades and is hopeful for a soccer scholarship.\n6. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information that is indirectly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, memory points 1 and 2 provide relevant context about Speaker B's academic focus, sports medicine, which is relevant as Speaker B mentions having exams coming up. However, the connection between MEMORY items and the current dialogue context is not very direct or strong. MEMORY points 3, 4, and 5 about Speaker A are somewhat relevant as they discuss schooling and grades, but they do not directly connect to the specific context of the conversation about exams. Point 6 about Speaker B's pressure to maintain grades provides useful background for understanding Speaker B's mindset but is not directly tied to the current topic. Overall, while MEMORY provides some useful context, it lacks strong direct connections to the current dialogue context, leading to a middle-ground score."
