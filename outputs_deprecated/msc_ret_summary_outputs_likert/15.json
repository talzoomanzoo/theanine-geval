Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun! Speaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim.  Speaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you  Speaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises. Speaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n2. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n3. Speaker A has planned to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination.\n4. Speaker A has planned a cruise to the Caribbeans.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n6. Speaker A is planning a snorkeling trip and has signed up for several trips.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is not entirely accurate or comprehensive. Mentioning Speaker A's offer to teach Speaker B how to swim (sentence 2) and the plan to go on a cruise to the Caribbean (sentence 4) aligns with the dialogue context. However, sentence 1 inaccurately states that Speaker B wants to listen to punk music while swimming and programming, which is not expressed by Speaker B in the context. Additionally, sentence 3 about snorkeling and other activities at the cruise destination is not directly mentioned in the context. Sentence 5 about the cruise together, and sentence 6 about snorkeling trips, although somewhat relevant, don't fully align with the dialogue and seem to introduce information not included in the context. Overall, while MEMORY contains some useful information, it lacks complete alignment and coherence with the context provided."
