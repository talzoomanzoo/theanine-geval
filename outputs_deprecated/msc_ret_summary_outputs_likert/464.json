Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is waiting for bands to announce their summer tour schedule to plan which shows to attend.\n2. Speaker A is interested in music concerts and planning a trip to Sao Paulo.\n3. Speaker A and their boyfriend also look forward to having some refreshing beers by the beach.\n4. Speaker A plans to do lots of shopping during their trip.\n5. Speaker B enjoys living in the city for the accessibility to food and live music.\n6. Speaker B has seen Three Dog Night in concert and enjoys their live shows.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some general context about the interests of Speaker B in music concerts (1 and 5) and Speaker A's interest in traveling and concerts (2). However, it doesn't directly address the question about Speaker B's first music concert this summer. The sentences are somewhat disconnected from the specific query in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, and there is no clear development or causality of events related to the upcoming summer concert of Speaker B. While the information that Speaker B is waiting for summer tour schedules (1) slightly relates to the question, the rest of the MEMORY (2-6) does not help in generating a direct and relevant response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which impacts its helpfulness."
