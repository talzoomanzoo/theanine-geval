Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has a government job that pays the bills but wishes they could work in interior design.\n2. Speaker B is not entirely satisfied with their job and wishes it was more rewarding.\n3. Speaker A finds job searching challenging and hopes to settle in the new city soon with a steady income.\n4. Speaker A is applying for a project coordinator role at a charity but aspires to become a project manager in the future.\n5. Speaker A has recently received a call for a job interview and is excited about it.\n6. Speaker B has two kids and enjoys painting and taking naps.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I have definitely thought about it. Interior design has always been a passion of mine, but I'm not sure if I could leave the security of my government job. It's a tough decision to make.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It clearly indicates that Speaker B has a government job but wishes to work in interior design, which directly relates to Speaker A's question about pursuing something creative and fulfilling full-time. Additionally, MEMORY item 6 mentions Speaker B enjoys painting, another creative outlet that could contribute to the conversation. The rest of the MEMORY provides context on Speaker A's employment situation, which isn't directly related to the question but helps set the stage for understanding the overall dynamics between the two speakers. The connections and developments in MEMORY are clear and logically structured, making it easier for a language model to generate an appropriate and informed response. However, there could be more emphasis on the connection between Speaker B's interest in painting and the potential for fulfilling creative work discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which slightly holds the score back from being a perfect 5."
