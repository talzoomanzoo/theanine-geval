    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far. Speaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes.  Speaker A: why don't you like books like that? Speaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading? Speaker A: Not yet.  I think Netflix is going to make it into a movie soon.  They might finally convince me to pay for a subscription haha. Speaker B: Well if it's any good I know you'll be watching the whole thing.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n2. Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix.\n3. Speaker A has grandchildren and enjoys watching movies with them.\n4. Speaker B has a son and enjoys reading books, particularly about animals.\n5. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n6. Speaker B is fascinated by animals and can relate to Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided offers a relatively helpful level of information that can aid in generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Relevant points include Speaker A enjoying Netflix (point 1), which connects to the discussion about the book being made into a Netflix movie. Points 2 and 3 also align with Speaker A's interests in both grandchildren (mentioned in the context) and books, supporting the context surrounding pleasure in a break from watching them. Additionally, point 4 provides insight into Speaker B's preference, further reiterating their interest in animal books which are discussed in the dialogue. \n\nWhile not all sentences are directly tied to the dialogue, they are naturally phrased and maintain coherence and provide contextual information about the relationship and preferences of both speakers. However, some repetition exists, like in memories 2 and 3 regarding grandchildren, slightly reducing the helpfulness and making this not quite a perfect score."
