Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company? Do you build computers or work on programming? Speaker B: I do like my job. My job is to troubleshoot issues between the hardware and software, so I get to work with both. Speaker A: That sounds interesting. That's great that you love your job, not many people do. Speaker B: Love is a strong word! I do like it though. There have been jobs I hated and I'm great full not be in that place. Hows you job going? Speaker A: Its going good. Its summer so we are really busy right now. I am just grateful to be back at work. How long have you worked for your company? Speaker B: For about four years. It's an industry in flux which is stressful. I need stability for my family at this point. It has changed my focus, which I'm not used to yet. Are you considering any other options for work?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B works for a computer company and is unable to change careers until their child graduates.\n2. Speaker A works for a small local business with a demanding schedule.\n3. Speaker A is 27 years old and hopes to change careers soon.\n4. Speaker A considers quitting their job to work at Disney World.\n5. Speaker A is torn between choosing a career in dentistry for the money or working at Disney for happiness.\n6. Speaker A is considering a career in dentistry but is also interested in working at Disney for happiness.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that can aid Speaker A in generating a response to the dialogue context. Points 1 and 2 provide background information about Speaker B's current job and Speaker A's work situation, aligning with the context of their job-related discussion. However, points 3 to 6 introduce details about Speaker A's personal career considerations, which are not directly referenced in the dialogue yet might become relevant if the conversation turns toward Speaker A's potential career changes. Although structured naturally, these additional points lack immediate relevance to the main flow of the conversation, resulting in moderate helpfulness. Overall, the MEMORY conveys past interactions well, but its relevance to the current dialogue limits its perfect usefulness."
