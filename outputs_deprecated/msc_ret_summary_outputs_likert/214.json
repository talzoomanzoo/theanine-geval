Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice.  Speaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with? Speaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think? Speaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point. Speaker A: Yes, it contains eggs.  I think you would do well with the fried rice. It's best to cook the rice the day before.   Speaker B: I didn't know that. Why cook the rice beforehand? Is it better to age rice or something? Speaker A: The rice needs to be cool before adding to the pan.  Are you able to take a passenger along in you truck? Speaker B: Oh! That makes since. I didn't realize that the temperature made a difference when frying rice. As for the truck, Yes I can. But, depending on what company I'm working for at the time, they often set restrictions on passengers.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker.\n2. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n3. Speaker A recommends the pressure cooker for its efficiency and ease of use, suggesting it to Speaker B.\n4. Speaker B does not cook, but enjoys listening to country music and drives trucks for a living.\n5. Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work.\n6. Speaker A primarily cooks Indian food and bakes a lot of rice dishes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "No worries, you can always enjoy the fried rice at home with your husband. Let me know how it turns out!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information that supports the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning and that their husband enjoys cooking, which aligns with the discussion of cooking beginner recipes. MEMORY mentions Speaker B's husband's interest in Asian food, which directly connects to the recommendation of shrimp fried rice in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the mention of Speaker A using a pressure cooker and cooking rice dishes helps explain why they might suggest shrimp fried rice and the use of a pressure cooker to Speaker B. The information about Speaker B being a truck driver is not directly relevant but is naturally phrased and does not detract from the overall context. Therefore, the MEMORY is mostly helpful in generating an appropriate response."
