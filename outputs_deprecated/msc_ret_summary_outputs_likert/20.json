Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun! Speaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim.  Speaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you  Speaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises. Speaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you? Speaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it. Speaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car? Speaker B: Yes, there are several. Hope we could meet and You possibly teach me about computer programming. Speaker A: That would be great too. I like to program in several different languages. Do you have a preference? Speaker B: No, I'm just getting started so I don't have a preference. Maybe you could show me what you prefer and we could start there.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n2. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n4. Speaker A has planned to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination.\n5. Speaker A has planned a cruise to the Caribbeans.\n6. Speaker B is interested in learning programming and is already practicing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Sure, I can definitely show you some different programming languages and see which one you like best. It's always good to explore different options in the beginning stages.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for Speaker A to generate a relevant next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY captures several key elements from the conversation: Speaker A offering to teach Speaker B swimming and programming (1), the discussion about punk music (2), and plans regarding a cruise (3, 4, 5). Points 5 and 3 are particularly relevant and well-structured, reflecting the development from discussing swimming lessons to progressing to the idea of a cruise. Sentence 6 captures Speaker B's interest and current state in programming, aligning well with the context of potentially meeting up for programming education. The MEMORY could be improved with minor adjustments to the natural phrasing and order, especially in including any details about the cruise activities that were not discussed (point 4), but overall, it provides information that can guide generating a coherent and contextually appropriate response."
