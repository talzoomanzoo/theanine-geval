Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you. Speaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them Speaker A: IN MY HOME?! A TREE? That was not at all what I was thinking. Do they grow well indoors? I am intrigued.  Speaker B: Well if you want to make it like a proper garden experience then I would suggest going all in, and go for the best most authentic looking items you could get  Speaker A: Wow! Ok! This is sounding like a bigger undertaking! Should I embrace bugs in the home if they help the plants or am I getting wild? Speaker B: Well from my experince bugs do the complete opposite and don't help at all, so avoid that at all costs! Fertilizers are the way to go to help with growth. Speaker A: Oh man. I have lots to learn. What is the lifespan of a plum tree? Speaker B: around 10 to 15 years but if you take care of them I'm sure you could get 20 out of it. Speaker A: Now we are also talking commitment! This is not how I expected my day to go! I am excited, yet so nervous!  Speaker B: It doesn't take too much time to do per day so after school give it a little water and that should keep them in great way. Speaking off school how are you getting on? Speaker A: Ok! I am putting my fate in your hands on this one. School is fine. I don't really pay attention to anything except band class.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing.\n2. Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden.\n3. Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more.\n4. Speaker A is a student who likes English in school and plays in the marching band.\n5. Speaker A's parents are teachers.\n6. Speaker A jokes about space weeds and expresses a desire to see space.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's great that you're excited about starting your garden! Keeping up with it after school will be a nice break from all the other distractions. It's good to have a passion like band class to focus on, too.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it's not as cohesive or directly connected to the specific conversation about indoor gardening. Sentence 1 about Speaker A's struggle with gardening and their interest in space plants is somewhat relevant as it aligns with the context of Speaker A learning and being intrigued by the idea of gardening. Sentence 2 establishes Speaker B's credibility as someone knowledgeable about gardening, which is useful for understanding the context of their advice in the dialogue. Sentence 4 offers insight into Speaker A's focus on the band, which ties into the conversation in the dialogue context regarding school. However, the other sentences provide information (like Speaker B's weight gain, Speaker A's parents being teachers, and jokes about space) that do not directly connect to the current topic of indoor gardening or provide useful context for developing the next part of the conversation. Overall, the MEMORY contains some insights but lacks a consistent and direct connection to the dialogue's progression, warranting a mid-range score."
