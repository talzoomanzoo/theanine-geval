Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive. Speaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B believes that luxurious items distract from the value of their family.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B have a friendly interaction and part ways on a positive note.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n4. Speaker B appreciates the convenience of city living but also values what the country has to offer.\n5. Speaker A used to live in a suburb of DC and misses the convenience of city life.\n6. Speaker B is open to moving to the country to be further away from neighbors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided includes various statements about Speaker A and Speaker B, but very few relate directly to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The first statement about Speaker B believing that luxurious items distract from the value of their family is somewhat relevant, as it ties into the topic of expensive purchases (like the iPhone), and could inform Speaker A's response. However, most of the other memories do not contribute directly to the current dialogue about buying an iPhone. For instance, statements about city versus country living or buying lotto tickets, while possibly character-building, do not help develop the conversation about the new purchase. Furthermore, these sentences don't clearly demonstrate a cohesive development or connection regarding both speakers' past interactions related to expensive items, making it harder for a language model to easily draw contextual cues for the given dialogue."
