Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies! Speaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?  \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mainly cares for dogs at the animal shelter, but also cats, and loves when new puppies are brought in.\n2. Speaker B is interested in volunteering and prefers cats over dogs, especially kittens.\n3. Speaker A loves animals, especially puppies, and visits shelters in every city they go to.\n4. Speaker B is a 26-year-old workaholic who is unsure about their career and doesn't have strong opinions on puppies.\n5. Speaker A is busy with work and used to foster puppies but no longer does.\n6. Speaker A dreams of meeting all the puppies from history when they can move through space and time.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Puppies bring so much joy and excitement with their playful and energetic nature. They always seem so full of life and pure happiness. But I understand that everyone has their preferences when it comes to animals. What is it about kittens that you love so much?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides helpful context that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It is clearly indicated that Speaker A has a strong affection for puppies and primarily cares for dogs at the shelter, which directly supports their statement about the new cat not being cuter than puppies (Memory Points 1 and 3). Additionally, it outlines that Speaker A loves animals and used to foster puppies but no longer does, which could explain their passion and the comparison made (Memory Points 3 and 5). The MEMORY also establishes Speaker B's preference for cats over dogs, which aligns with their query about the difference between kittens and puppies (Memory Point 2). While Memory Points 4 and 6 seem less relevant to the immediate context of the dialogue, they are still well-structured and provide background that can help the language model understand the speakers' perspectives. Overall, the MEMORY is coherent, providing insights into both speakers' views on cats and dogs, which aids in generating a proper next response to the conversation."
