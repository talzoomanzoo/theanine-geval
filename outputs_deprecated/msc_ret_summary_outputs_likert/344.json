Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far. Speaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes.  Speaker A: why don't you like books like that? Speaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading? Speaker A: Not yet.  I think Netflix is going to make it into a movie soon.  They might finally convince me to pay for a subscription haha. Speaker B: Well if it's any good I know you'll be watching the whole thing. Speaker A: you know it.  And I know that you would just fall asleep during it whether it's any good or not. Speaker B: Is there a lot of violence in your book? I couldn't stand to read it if there was. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n2. Speaker B has a son and enjoys reading books, particularly about animals.\n3. Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix.\n4. Speaker A has grandchildren and enjoys watching movies with them.\n5. Speaker B is fascinated by animals and can relate to Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals.\n6. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "There is quite a bit of violence, but it adds to the suspense. I can see why you prefer your peaceful animal books instead.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful background information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker A enjoys reading books and watching Netflix, which aligns with Speaker A’s interest in the crime drama book and the potential Netflix adaptation mentioned in the dialogue. It also notes Speaker A’s grandchildren, which corresponds with them not having watched their grandkids that day. On the other hand, it highlights Speaker B’s interest in animal books, which is relevant to their preference for non-fictional literature over fiction, as they express in the dialogue. However, not all sentences in the MEMORY are directly connected with the conversation, such as Speaker A watching Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars, and could have been better tailored to fit the context of the dialogue specifically. Thus, it provides moderate helpfulness as some parts of the MEMORY align with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but not all of it is smoothly connected or developmentally relevant."
