Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue. Speaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad. Speaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs! Speaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is looking to redecorate their house and likes purple furniture.\n2. Speaker B regrets their green and purple color scheme and is willing to give away their purple furniture.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing furniture and home decor choices.\n4. Speaker B is considering adding more colorful elements to the room to make the purple sofas work.\n5. Speaker A suggests ways to incorporate the purple sofas into the existing light green paint in the room.\n6. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I got my patio furniture from a local store that had a great sale. Maybe we can check out some options together and see what would go well with your new color scheme. Let's make a day of it!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically about the color scheme and furniture discussions between Speaker A and Speaker B. For instance, sentences 2, 3, and 5 provide context about Speaker B's dissatisfaction with their current color scheme, which aligns with the ongoing conversation. However, some sentences, like sentence 1 and 6, seem unrelated or less connected to the immediate dialogue context about the living room discussion and upcoming barbecue. While these sentences are well-structured, they might not be directly beneficial for generating the next response in the given dialogue. Overall, the MEMORY provides some relevant context but could be more directly aligned with the ongoing dialogue's focus."
