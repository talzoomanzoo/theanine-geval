Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well? Speaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes? Speaker A: I want to take some martial art classes at school next year. What do you sggest I try? Speaker B: I mean I always recommend Karate since that's what I study! I can bring you by the dojo sometime if you want to see what it is like.  Speaker A: OMG!! That would be so awesome, Yes please.  When is a good time for you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B signed up for classes at the local college and has a background in football and karate.\n2. Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work.\n3. Speaker B practices karate and works as a lifeguard but is looking for a different career.\n4. Speaker B attends football games at their old high school and finds that their football background helps in karate footwork.\n5. Speaker A is studying marketing and enjoys it.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B both have interests in learning new languages.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provided offers relevant information about Speaker B that can assist in generating a response to Speaker A's request about visiting the dojo. Specifically, sentences about Speaker B's involvement in Karate (e.g., Sentence 2) and their openness to other activities and future plans (e.g., Sentence 3) create a context of availability that can be incorporated into the response. Additionally, details such as their football background (e.g., Sentence 4) and education background (mentioned in Sentences 1, 2, 3) could be relevant in conveying Speaker B's well-rounded nature and enthusiasm for introducing Speaker A to martial arts, potentially being applied to a broader conversation context.\n\nSentences about Speaker A's interests, such as marketing (e.g., Sentence 5), do not closely tie to the current dialogue context but are presented in a way that is non-distracting. The memory's connection between Speaker B's characterization and the dialogue shows sufficient relevance to assign a higher score, though not perfect as some details are less pertinent."
