Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job. Speaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career. Speaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday. Speaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud. Speaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach? Speaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option. Speaker A: Yes I think history is interesting, too! Both of those subjects would be great because there are probably lots of teaching jobs. What kind of history do you like? Speaker B: I love all sorts of history. Right now I am really getting into the weeds of World War II. There's so much to unpack.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\n3. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n4. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n5. Speaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\n6. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's fascinating! World War II is such a complex and interesting period to study. It's great to see your passion for history growing. Have you considered combining your interest in linguistics with history in your teaching career?",
    "prediction": "While evaluating the MEMORY against the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, it's important to assess how well the stored memories help shape the ongoing conversation or inform Speaker A's potential responses.\n\n1. **Relevancy to Context**:\n   - Sentence 1 in MEMORY directly relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as Speaker A expresses an interest in teaching robotics. This matches their stated ambition in the conversation, providing continuity.\n   - Sentences 2 and 4 discuss Speaker B's major, linguistics, which isn't directly mentioned in the context but aligns somewhat with their interest in teaching English, as discussed in the dialogue.\n   - Sentence 3 mentions Speaker B's further education plans, which could be relevant to their career discussion in the context. However, this didn't emerge explicitly in the context.\n   - Sentence 5 provides background on Speaker A's life (working at a pizza shop), unrelated to the active conversation's career focus.\n   - Sentence 6 highlights both Speakers' value for education, which is tangentially related to their teaching discussion but doesn't clarify or expand their specific conversation thread.\n\n2. **Structure and Clarity**:\n   - Each sentence in MEMORY provides a clear and distinct fact about the speakers. However, there is a mix of useful info related to context and unrelated details without strong narrative binding them together.\n\n3. **Potential Usefulness**:\n   - There's useful information pertinent to the current discussion within MEMORY but deeper integration with the dialogue's main topics would enhance coherence. However, there are also memory entries that do not align directly with the ongoing dialogue and therefore aren’t as helpful.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides some helpful cues for generating responses aligned with the career and teaching topic in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but could benefit from stronger ties to the ongoing interaction.\n\n**Helpfulness Score: 3** \n\nThe MEMORY has some helpful entries that relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but includes information that doesn’t immediately contribute to the conversation's progression. A more focused or relevant set of memories could improve the helpfulness score."
