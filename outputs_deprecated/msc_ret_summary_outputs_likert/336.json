Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n2. Speaker A has grandchildren and enjoys watching movies with them.\n3. Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix.\n4. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n5. Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves by using technology or watching TV.\n6. Speaker A suggests taking naps during quiet times and mentions watching her grandkids.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, it was a great escape. I love getting lost in a good book, especially after keeping up with my energetic grandchildren all day.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives insight into Speaker A's regular activities and attitudes, such as being tired after looking after energetic grandchildren and enjoying reading books and watching Netflix. The MEMORY notes that the grandchildren can entertain themselves, which could be relevant if elaborating on the break Speaker A got from watching them. Overall, the MEMORY is well-structured and offers contextually relevant information, making it easier for a language model to generate a coherent response. However, it could still include slightly more direct connections to elements discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT for a perfect score."
