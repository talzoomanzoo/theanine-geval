Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place? Speaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping? Speaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp? Speaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer? Speaker A: I've only camped in a tent so far, but would like to try out a camper trailer. What do use for camping? Speaker B: We usually do tents but we have camped in yurts too. Did you go to the zoo last weekend? Speaker A: I see. Yes, I did make it to the zoo.  Have you gone to your local zoo? Speaker B: I went to the Bronx zoo it was amazing! Did you get to see Joshua? Speaker A: I think the Bronx Zoo is one of the best in the country.   Yes, I did see Joshua.  Did you use a season pass for the zoo or just a one time ticket? Speaker B: One time. I was just there visititng family. What is your favorite zoo to visit?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n2. Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys.\n3. Speaker B is interested in finding family discounts for the zoo.\n4. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n5. Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys.\n6. Speaker A suggests taking the pets to the zoo and mentions that most major cities have good zoos.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I love visiting the San Diego Zoo. It's a great place to spend the day and see all kinds of animals.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provided brings some helpful context about the speakers and their interests in zoos, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Notably, points 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 provide information about Speaker A and Speaker B's interests and actions related to visiting zoos, which could aid in constructing relevant and informed responses.\n\n- Point 1 and 2 illustrate Speaker A's enjoyment of zoo visits and preference for certain animals, which aligns with the ongoing dialogue about zoo visits.\n- Points 3, 4, and 5 present Speaker B's interest in zoo-related activities and motivations connected to family, which provide context for discussions related to zoo visits and their importance for family activities.\n\nHowever, some points are less directly related or not referenced in the provided DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Points about taking pets to the zoo or growing up in big cities do not clearly integrate with the current conversation topics, though they could potentially guide the conversation indirectly.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY does capture some relevant past interactions, but its utility to the immediate DIALOGUE CONTEXT isn't maximized by clear and direct connections. It could be structured more clearly to enhance relevance and provide stronger contextual cues."
