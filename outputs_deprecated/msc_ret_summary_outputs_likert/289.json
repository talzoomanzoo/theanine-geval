Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on! Speaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar. Speaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general? Speaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts. Speaker A: How's learning to bake going in general, especially now that you're off desserts? Speaker B: I one of those people how have to fail a couple of times before I get the hang of it, but I'm getting there.  Have you and the kids had any chance to go skiing lately? Speaker A: Water skiing? Yes, last weekend. It was so much fun! Speaker B: (sorry my typing sucks)  That's awesome. I wish had access to a boat, but who knows, maybe one day.  Speaker A: Boating is so fun. You could go wakeboarding more often if you had your own boat. And no more boat rental fees or hassle. Speaker B: I actually saw a drone the at will pull you in the water. It's the craziest thing.  \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is excited to join Speaker A's family for a water skiing trip and wants to learn from Speaker A's kids.\n2. Speaker B expresses interest in trying water skiing next.\n3. Speaker A loves boating and water sports, mentioning that they are better at water skiing than wakeboarding.\n4. Speaker A has been water skiing for 15 years and has 3 kids who also water ski.\n5. Speaker B enjoys snowboarding but will focus on wakeboarding as summer approaches.\n6. Speaker A learned how to make jello from their grandma, turning it into a family tradition.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds awesome! A drone that can pull you in the water for wakeboarding? Technology really is amazing. I wonder if it's as fun as traditional water skiing behind a boat.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically regarding Speaker A's background and interests related to water skiing and family traditions. For example, the memory that Speaker A learned how to make jello from their grandma connects to the current conversation about jello recipes and family traditions. Additionally, the details about water skiing might give context if the conversation pivots back to discussing water sports. However, other parts of the memory, such as the specific preferences and expertise levels in water skiing vs. other sports like wakeboarding, are not directly relevant to the immediate dialogue context that is focused more on family traditions and sugar consumption. The connections between the memory points and the current dialogue context could be more explicit for a higher score."
