Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet?  Speaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name? Speaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended.  Speaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n2. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n3. Speaker A is interested in training tips for the kittens and is open to adopting one despite having a parrot.\n4. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n5. Speaker B has two sick kitties and recently received a rescue.\n6. Speaker A suggested the name Zhao for one of the kittens.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've been doing some research on introducing cats to birds. I think with some proper training and supervision, they can coexist peacefully.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several pieces of information that are relevant and helpful to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Speaker A's interest in adopting a rescue kitten and having a parrot are directly connected to the current dialogue, as these details were brought up in both Speaker A's and Speaker B's discussions. Additionally, MEMORY point 3 hints at Speaker A's openness to adopting despite having a parrot, which is relevant to Speaker B's concern about whether the cats and the parrot would get along. Speaker B having filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens, as mentioned in point 4, adds context to their conversation about names for the kittens. Furthermore, the suggestion of naming a kitten Oreo based on its color aligns with the MEMORY indicating a consideration of names based on personality or traits. Overall, MEMORY includes relevant connections and developments that support the dialogue, although some aspects, such as the specifics regarding sick kitties and Mandarin names, are not addressed in the dialogue."
