Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist, mentioning the ups and downs of the profession.\n2. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n3. Speaker A works at a stable and enjoys being around horses.\n4. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n5. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n6. Speaker B is a professional in a practice, where it is illegal for them to have relationships with clients.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's really admirable. It must be so rewarding to be able to make a positive impact on people's lives every day.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides several points that are helpful for the language model to generate a response. Specifically, it highlights Speaker B's passion for helping people (which aligns with their motivation to become a therapist mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT) and discusses aspects of Speaker B's career, like the ups and downs, indicating a level of experience and reflection. Furthermore, MEMORY point 5 aligns with the context since Speaker B has been working in their practice for about six years, which supports their dedication to the profession.\n\nHowever, some MEMORY points are less relevant to the immediate DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B being a football fan or Speaker A working at a stable. Nevertheless, these are naturally phrased, enabling the language model to distinguish which information may be less helpful for the current conversation. Overall, the MEMORY is structured in a way that allows the language model to draw relevant contextual cues, contributing to its helpfulness."
