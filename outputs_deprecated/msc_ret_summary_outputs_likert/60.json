Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place? Speaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping? Speaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp? Speaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer? Speaker A: I've only camped in a tent so far, but would like to try out a camper trailer. What do use for camping? Speaker B: We usually do tents but we have camped in yurts too. Did you go to the zoo last weekend?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n2. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n3. Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys.\n4. Speaker B expresses concern about leaving a kitten alone during their family camping adventures.\n5. Speaker B is interested in finding family discounts for the zoo.\n6. Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains information that indirectly pertains to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as both touch upon themes of family activities and shared interests. However, the MEMORY's focus on zoo visits contrasts the campsite setting in the DIALOGUE, thus limiting direct relevancy. Crucially, sentence 4 bridges the camping conversation with detail about concerns Speaker B has yet to discuss, providing potential dialogue development. Nonetheless, the connection between this MEMORY and the current dialogue could be stronger. The phrases are naturally structured, yet do not fully enhance the language model's ability to comprehensively aid in new response generation due to sporadic relevancy."
