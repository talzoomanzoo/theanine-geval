Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin! Speaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name?  Speaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls! \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Marmalade.\n2. Speaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten.\n3. Speaker A has a kitten from their cat and enjoys taking them on trips.\n4. Speaker B is not a cat person but ends up taking care of stray cats brought home by kids.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B have a light-hearted and humorous conversation about their pets and travels.\n6. Speaker A enjoys drinking tea and water.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Haha, the Spice Girls of the cat world! Pumpkin and Ginger, what a pair. Maybe I should start naming the strays that show up at my door after my favorite snacks.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically regarding Speaker A's cat and kitten, which aligns with the current conversation about naming the kitten Pumpkin. Sentences 1 and 2 are particularly relevant as they establish context about Speaker A's pets, although they do require some inference to piece together the recent decision to change the kitten's name. \n\nHowever, the remaining sentences in the MEMORY (3, 4, 5, and 6) offer little direct support to generate a next response in the current dialogue. Sentence 4, although related to cats, primarily provides background about Speaker B, which doesn't directly connect to the immediate topic of naming. Sentence 5 and 6 stray further from the critical content of the dialogue. Overall, while the MEMORY contains elements that could bolster the understanding of the ongoing dialogue, it lacks a cohesive narrative or causal development directly linked to the decision around the kitten's name, thus achieving only moderate helpfulness."
