Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting! Speaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow? Speaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from. Speaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same. Speaker A: I think I would try a plant based burger.  I don't find anything wrong with plants, and it's worth trying for the experience alone.  I'm jut not familiar with the cloning process.  Although I think it is cool and interesting, I just don't know enough about it to say I want to eat anything from a cloned animal. Speaker B: That's good that you keep an open mind! The cloning process is actually relatively simple, and happens in nature already! Did you know bananas, avocados, and some bees clone themselves? The only difference is, we do this in a lab!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n2. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner.\n3. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n4. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n5. Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\n6. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I had no idea that bananas and avocados clone themselves! That's fascinating. I guess cloning isn't as scary or unnatural as I thought. I would definitely be open to trying a plant-based burger knowing that.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information regarding Speaker B's involvement in lab research and their interest in neuroscience, which loosely connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B mentions working in a lab for cloning. However, the MEMORY lacks specific past interactions that would directly aid in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\nMost of the sentences in the MEMORY pertain to broader context or different themes such as cooking, which are not directly related to the conversation about cloning, classes, or plant-based versus cloned burgers. While these memory pieces are structured in a natural way, they do not present a strong causal or developmental connection to the topics currently being discussed. Therefore, the MEMORY only provides limited valuable context for the dialogue, leading to a relatively low score."
