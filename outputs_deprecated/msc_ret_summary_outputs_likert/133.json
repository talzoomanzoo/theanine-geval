Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting! Speaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow? Speaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from. Speaker B: Thanks for the encouragement! You wouldn't eat a cloned one, but would you try a Beyond burger or plant-based version? Some people say they taste really similar, but I never thought they tasted the same.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n3. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n4. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n5. Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\n6. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've actually tried a Beyond burger before and I was pleasantly surprised by how similar it tasted to a traditional beef burger. It's amazing how far plant-based alternatives have come in replicating the taste and texture of meat. I would definitely give it a try again!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provided contains several pieces of information, but not all are relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context revolves around Speaker B's work in the lab related to cloning cows, interests in plant-based burgers, and managing work with academic pressures. MEMORY sentences 2, 5, and 6 provide context about Speaker B's involvement in lab research and planning to major in molecular biology, which is directly relevant to the discussions in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 2 also introduces the Speakers' diverse fields that could add dimension to future conversations, though the specific mention of \"cooking\" (sentence 2) and Speaker A wanting to try Speaker B's famous hamburgers (sentence 1) isn't immediately relevant. Sentence 4 about what Speaker B had for dinner is irrelevant to the conversation. Overall, while MEMORY provides context about Speaker B's professional and academic interests related to the lab, many details are peripheral, reducing overall helpfulness. However, the structure of MEMORY is clear and it doesn't confuse the contextual relevance, just dilutes it a bit with unnecessary details."
