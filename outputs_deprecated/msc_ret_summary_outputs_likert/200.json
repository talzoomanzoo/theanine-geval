Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her? Speaker B: Hi there, hope you are wlll and managing to save up for your Italy trip?  Thank for asking about the Greek mythology study, we are doing very well. It helps because i am so passionate about it and hope to get to the Greek islands soon Speaker A: Yes I have been saving up for another trip to Italy! I can't wait. It's planned for next Spring. Do you have any plans to go back to Italy in the future? Speaker B: I would love to get back to Italy but need to save up and the hopeful priority is to Greece this year.  You have friends in Europe are you in contact to see what plans you can make? Speaker A: Yes I've been talking to them quite a bit so they know what's going on. I'll be staying with some of them while I'm over there. I have never been to Greece....I'd like to go though. Maybe I'll add it to my itinerary! Maybe we could plan to be in Greece at the same time?!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology.\n2. Speaker A is planning to travel to Italy alone for Spring Break and has friends from Europe meeting up with them.\n3. Speaker B has been to Italy in the past and enjoyed the food there.\n4. Speaker A is fascinated by the architecture of Italy and enjoys studying history, especially through reading and watching documentaries.\n5. Speaker B enjoys Greek mythology and did a case study on Poseidon, the God of the Sea, Earthquakes, and Horses.\n6. Speaker A is planning for a spring break trip and recently bought a dress for Easter.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great idea! It would be wonderful to explore Greece together and dive deeper into the history and mythology. Let's definitely plan to be there at the same time and make some unforgettable memories.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that could assist in generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it could be more focused and cohesive. \n\n- Sentences 1 and 5 in MEMORY are most directly related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as they convey Speaker B's interest in Greek mythology and visiting Greece, aligning well with the discussion about Greek mythology and travel plans to Greece. This information is particularly helpful since Speaker A is considering visiting Greece alongside Speaker B.\n  \n- Sentence 3 discusses Speaker B's past experiences in Italy. While not directly related to the conversation about planning for future trips, it adds context about Speaker B’s historical ties to traveling.\n\n- Sentence 2 about Speaker A's plans to travel to Italy alone and meeting friends adds context, although duplicative since some details are already mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\n- Sentences 4 and 6 do not provide significant contributions to MEMORY relevant to the current CONTEXT, considering they mention Speaker A's interests in Italian architecture and a new dress for Easter, which aren’t directly pertinent to Greek mythology or Greece travel plans. \n\nUltimately, while MEMORY contains useful elements, it could better demonstrate clear relevance and connections to improve its overall helpfulness."
