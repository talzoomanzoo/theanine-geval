Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well? Speaker B: The older one seems to like it while the youngest cannot be bothered. Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon? Speaker A: Yes!  As a matter of fact, I'm visiting my son that lives in Spain next month.  This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has two sons who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next.\n2. Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe.\n3. Speaker B's younger son would be jealous of Speaker A's sons' European tour.\n4. Speaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite worrying about them traveling far away.\n5. Speaker A has multiple sons, at least one of them is in a relationship with a Spanish girlfriend.\n6. Speaker A's boys are leaving again in a few months for another trip after studying abroad.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's so exciting! I'm sure you're looking forward to meeting her. It must be nice to have your sons spread out in different countries.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for generating a response in the context of the ongoing dialogue. Sentences 1, 4, and 5 contain useful information about Speaker A's sons studying abroad in Spain and having Spanish girlfriends, directly connecting to their current discussion about visiting Spain and meeting a son's girlfriend. Sentence 2, while not directly relevant, hints at potential future interactions that could be elaborated on. Sentences 3 and 6 provide additional background details. The sentences are connected with a coherent narrative about Speaker Aâ€™s sons studying abroad and their travels. The MEMORY is phrased in a manner that helps the language model understand the context and provides support for generating a relevant response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
