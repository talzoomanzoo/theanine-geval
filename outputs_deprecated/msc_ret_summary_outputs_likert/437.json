Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for. Speaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for? Speaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work? Speaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol Speaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise?  Speaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows. Speaker A: That sounds wonderful! You'd get to just be out in nature all day. Sounds like a great job, especially if you're a bit introverted like me. That's why hiking is my favorite -- a good solitary activity. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking, mentioning setting up a hammock at their campsite.\n3. Speaker A is looking for a job and new camping gear, specifically a hammock.\n4. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n5. Speaker B enjoys camping, hiking, and is kind, caring, and hopeful for group equality.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B have gone hiking together before and plan to meet up for another hike.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That does sound like a dream job, being out in nature as a guide. I can see you really enjoying that kind of work. And hiking is a great way to recharge and have some alone time. Maybe we can plan another hiking trip soon to catch up and enjoy the outdoors together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides relatively helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains details about both speakers' shared interests in hiking and camping, which relate to the current conversation about jobs and personal preferences. The mention of Speaker A applying for a job at a grocery store near a hiking trail (sentence 1) and their enjoyment of outdoor activities (sentence 2) connects well with the context of finding a suitable job and a love for nature. Additionally, Speaker B's interest in camping and hiking (sentence 5) and previous hiking trips with Speaker A (sentence 6) support understanding of the shared background and interests, making it easier for the language model to craft a relevant response. However, some sentences, like Speaker A being a recent high school graduate (sentence 4), are not directly related to the current dialogue but still provide background information that can be beneficial for a more comprehensive understanding of Speaker A's situation. Overall, the MEMORY maintains a natural structure and relevant connections, but minor details could be more directly aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT for a perfect score."
