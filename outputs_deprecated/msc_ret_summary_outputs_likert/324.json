Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n2. Speaker A hears raccoons and cats fighting in their neighborhood.\n3. Speaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n4. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly.\n5. Speaker A has not interacted closely with raccoons but admires them.\n6. Speaker B considers raccoons intelligent and funny.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for Speaker B's response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY clearly outlines Speaker A's ongoing situation with the raccoon problem and Speaker B's past interactions and thoughts on raccoons. The information about Speaker A buying aluminum sheeting to address this problem is directly relevant to the context. Furthermore, Speaker B's perspective on raccoons—being interested in training them, considering them as potential pets, and regarding them as intelligent—is useful for generating a contextually aware and empathetic response to Speaker A's statement. The MEMORY sentences are structured in a way that reflects past interactions and shared interests, which can guide Speaker B in responding effectively. However, not all of them are connected directly to the current context (for instance, Speaker A admiring raccoons doesn't offer immediate relevance), though they are naturally phrased and provide a broad understanding of the speakers' interactions concerning raccoons."
