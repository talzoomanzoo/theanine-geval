Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing? Speaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions.\n2. Speaker A is getting their portrait painted by Speaker B.\n3. Speaker B is a painter and is working on a portrait for Speaker A.\n4. Speaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals, discovered love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets.\n5. Speaker A is considering getting kittens and thinks rats can be smart.\n6. Speaker B has 5 dogs of different breeds and has rats as pets but didn't include them in the portrait.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a hilarious and adorable portrait idea! As for the new cat, I'm thinking about adopting from a local shelter. I've heard they have some really sweet kittens looking for a home.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information that is helpful for a language model to generate a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n- Sentence 2 and 3 directly relate to the context, confirming that Speaker B is painting a portrait for Speaker A. This aligns with the ongoing discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about painting and portraits.\n- Sentence 1 offers additional relevant information, as Speaker B's pet interests (especially Persian cats) may be relevant to Speaker A's question about where to get their new cat.\n- Sentence 5 provides insight into Speaker A's considerations about getting kittens and connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT's focus on pets.\n- Sentence 6 adds more context about Speaker B's pets and their painting choices, which could indirectly contribute to the conversation by expanding on Speaker B's connection to animals.\n- Sentence 4, while offering background on Speaker B's painting preferences, is less directly tied to the current conversation but still adds context to Speaker B's character as a painter.\n\nOverall, MEMORY contains sentences that are relevant and naturally structured, demonstrating a clear development in the past interactions between the speakers that relate closely to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. There are some sentences slightly less relevant or any that might be dense with pertinent details, preventing a perfect score."
