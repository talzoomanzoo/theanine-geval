Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well? Speaker B: The older one seems to like it while the youngest cannot be bothered. Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon? Speaker A: Yes!  As a matter of fact, I'm visiting my son that lives in Spain next month.  This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now! Speaker B: Oh nice. You must be looking forward to it. He must have told you a lot about her. Do you think you would like her? Speaker A: I think so.  She seems like a very sweet girl and she seems to care deeply about my son, so that's what matters most.  You know, maybe I can stop by and visit you as well, since you live in Europe.  France, Spain, Italy?  Where are you living now?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has two sons who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next.\n2. Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe.\n3. Speaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite worrying about them traveling far away.\n4. Speaker B's younger son would be jealous of Speaker A's sons' European tour.\n5. Speaker A has multiple sons, at least one of them is in a relationship with a Spanish girlfriend.\n6. Speaker B has two sons, one who loves Chinese food like Speaker A, and the other who prefers Italian food.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm currently in Italy, actually. It would be great to catch up if you're in the area. Just let me know when you're planning to visit and we can arrange something.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes relevant information, such as Speaker A having sons in Spain and a son with a Spanish girlfriend, which are directly related to the conversation context about visiting a son in Spain and meeting his girlfriend. Additionally, it mentions the travel interests and relationships of both speakers, which could be useful contextual information. However, not all memory elements are directly relevant to the immediate continuation of the dialogue, such as the preferences of Speaker B's sons regarding food or Speaker A's sons' future travel plans to Italy, which are not immediately applicable to the topic of the conversation. Overall, the memory provides contextually relevant and well-structured sentences that could support generating informed responses."
