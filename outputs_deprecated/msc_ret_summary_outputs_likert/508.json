Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has grandkids who are more interested in phones and tablets than musical instruments.\n2. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n3. Speaker B mentions having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own.\n4. Speaker A has children and grandchildren, with at least one child interested in learning the flute.\n5. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n6. Speaker A's other children are addicted to tablets and phones, unlike the youngest one who is interested in music.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I do use text messaging to stay in touch with them. But sometimes I wish they were more interested in playing musical instruments like your youngest one.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information about Speaker B's interactions and experiences with their grandkids, which can be helpful for Speaker B to generate a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about using technology like text messaging. Sentence 1 directly ties into the context by noting that Speaker B's grandkids are more interested in electronic devices, which can naturally lead into a discussion about texting as a form of communication. Sentence 5 also adds context by mentioning a past activity (fishing) with mixed responses, implying potential for further engagement through other means like texting. Though sentence 2 and 3 are helpful for background context on family interactions, they are less directly relevant to the context. Nonetheless, the MEMORY is well-structured and provides an understanding of the family dynamics and technological engagement, which is useful for crafting a response."
