Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college? Speaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position.  Speaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it? Speaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days.  Speaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living. Speaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime? Speaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play. Speaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n2. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.\n3. Speaker A enjoys playing soccer but is not into music.\n4. Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n5. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n6. Speaker A is a fan of Arsenal and enjoys watching international teams play.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Sounds like a plan! I'll let you know when we have a game scheduled. Casual games can be just as fun and a great way to get back into it.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several helpful details relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains information about Speaker A's involvement in soccer, like being part of a soccer team, playing as a striker, and having a match next week. These aspects align with the conversation around playing soccer and organizing a casual game, allowing for a cohesive understanding of Speaker A's background in the sport. Additionally, the memory reflects Speaker B's history with soccer and support for Manchester United, which compliments their interest in playing for exercise. However, not all memory points are critical to the immediate context (such as musical interests and international teams), yet they are naturally phrased, so their irrelevance is easily identifiable. This combination of relevant and clear structure makes the MEMORY very close to being fully helpful."
