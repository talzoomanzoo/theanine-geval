Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job. Speaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n2. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\n3. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n4. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n5. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n6. Speaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I completely understand the stress of making such a big decision. Teaching definitely sounds like a solid choice for you, especially with your passion for linguistics. Just keep exploring your options and follow your heart.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful and relevant information that helps inform Speaker A's response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Several points about Speaker B's background and aspirations align well with the discussion about career options and teaching. Specifically, memory points 1 and 3 give insight into Speaker B's current academic status and internal conflict, which directly relate to the conversation about considering teaching. Point 2 supports this by providing clarity on Speaker B's overall goal of wanting a practical job, which aligns with the notion of teaching as a stable career presented in the dialogue.\n\nPoints 4, 5, and 6, while not directly related to the decision about teaching, help add depth to Speaker A and B's broader discussions and interests, particularly around education and career choices. The information about Speaker A's interest in teaching computer science and their part-time job to afford college supports a comprehensive understanding of Speaker A's perspective, useful for generating relevant and consistent dialogue references in future interactions.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY is detailed and structured, effectively enhancing the context needed for Speaker A to continue a coherent and contextually informed conversation."
