Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job. Speaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career. Speaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday. Speaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud. Speaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach? Speaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option. Speaker A: Yes I think history is interesting, too! Both of those subjects would be great because there are probably lots of teaching jobs. What kind of history do you like? Speaker B: I love all sorts of history. Right now I am really getting into the weeds of World War II. There's so much to unpack. Speaker A: For sure! So much happened and it really affected how the world is today. I like learning about the history of places where I have lived, it's really interesting.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\n3. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n4. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n5. Speaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\n6. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's amazing how much history shapes our world today. It's great to see your passion for robotics and computer science, and I'm sure you'll make a fantastic teacher in that field. Your parents must be proud of your dedication and hard work.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that would aid Speaker B in generating responses in continuation of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The first memory point directly connects to the dialogue as it emphasizes Speaker A's interest in teaching and computer science, aligning with the topic of discussing career paths in education. This is particularly applicable in understanding Speaker Aâ€™s interests and future career considerations.\n\nMemory points 2, 3, and 4 relate to Speaker B's career considerations, even if the specific detail of linguistics is not mentioned in the dialogue, it connects with the overall theme of considering career paths in teaching, thus offering helpful context for Speaker B's responses about their potential career trajectory.\n\nMemory point 6 highlights a shared value between the two speakers, enhancing the ability to generate contextual dialogue by providing a basis for understanding their common ground in valuing education.\n\nWhile point 5 provides additional context about Speaker A's current situation, it is less directly related to the immediate dialogue concerning teaching and career options. Still, it is naturally phrased and not misleadingly irrelevant.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY successfully contextualizes the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and past interactions, demonstrating relevance and connection."
