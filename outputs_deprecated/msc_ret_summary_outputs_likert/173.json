Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately? Speaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me. Speaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway? Speaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day! I'll make it as fun as possible. Speaker B: I will someday. just not in the summer when all the bugs are out! Where do you go hiking the most? Speaker A: I like to go hiking in the local trails here. I am familiar with them and there's so many routes that I can take. Sadly, the bugs are as bad here as they are anywhere else..... Speaker B: They can't be that bad in the fall right? I hope? Do you camp most every weekend? Speaker A: A least a couple of times a month. Sometimes, yeah, I go every weekend to relax. Being in nature is so relaxing to me. And nah the bugs aren't too bad in the fall and winter. There's a beautiful river along one trail that I bet you'd love to see.  Speaker B: That sounds like it would be relaxing. I would probable be okay if we didn't run into any wolves, bears etc. Have you ever came across any predators when you were camping? Speaker A: Oh I've seen bears and even a mountain lion. Luckily, it was a far away encounter and they didn't know that we were there. As soon as I saw them we changed directions fairly quickly but quietly. Don't worry, I've only seen it a handful of times in my time camping.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks.\n2. Speaker A enjoys camping trips and looking for wild animals in the woods.\n3. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking as free activities.\n4. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n5. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n6. Speaker A is comfortable around animals in the woods but admits a bear would make them jumpy.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Good to know you have some experience handling those situations. I think I'll stick to my urban adventures for now!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information that is somewhat useful for generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, sentences 1 and 3 mention Speaker A's enjoyment of camping and hiking, which aligns with the dialogue where Speaker A leads hikes and finds nature relaxing. Sentence 6 also touches on Speaker A's encounters with animals, relevant to the discussion about bears and mountain lions in the dialogue. However, sentences 2, 4, and 5 either introduce inaccuracies or facts not relevant to the current dialogue (such as Speaker A's interest in looking for wild animals, Speaker B's long hike, and the mention of planning trips on the Appalachian Trail). This mixed relevancy and accuracy detracts from the overall coherence and helpfulness of the MEMORY. Overall, while some parts of the MEMORY contribute well to understanding the dialogue, inconsistencies prevent it from being rated higher."
