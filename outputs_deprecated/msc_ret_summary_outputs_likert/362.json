Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing? Speaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha! Speaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes? Speaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe.  Speaker A: You make them sounds so fascinating. Will you take them with you to your college dorm?  Speaker B: I'll be living off campus, so absolutely. How about you? Are you staying in the dorms?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel.\n2. Speaker A does not have any pets and expresses an interest in scuba diving.\n3. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n4. Speaker B is excited about taking neuroscience classes next year.\n5. Speaker B goes to Hawaii for scuba diving and is considering studying marine life or a different type of animal.\n6. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm actually thinking about getting my scuba diving certification this summer and spending my free time exploring the underwater world. It's so different from observing animals on land, but equally fascinating in its own way.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information that could be helpful for Speaker A in generating an appropriate response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n1. Sentence 1 provides useful information with the names of Speaker B's pet snakes, which could be relevant to the discussion about the snakes.\n2. Sentence 2 is not directly relevant to the current dialogue about snakes but gives insight into Speaker A's hobbies and interests, which could shape future interactions.\n3. Sentence 4 is relevant as it shows Speaker B's excitement for neuroscience, a detail that complements their overall science and reptile interest mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n4. Sentences 3, 5, and 6 offer additional insight into the personalities and interests of both speakers, even though they aren't directly related to the current dialogue. These details are naturally phrased, making it easy for a model to determine their relevance.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides contextual cues that align with the dialogue and help develop the interaction, though some information is not directly applicable to the immediate conversation about snakes."
