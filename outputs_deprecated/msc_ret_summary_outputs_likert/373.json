Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job! Speaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. Speaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?   Speaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone. Speaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you? Speaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know. Speaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient!  Speaker A: Wow, that gives me a completely different perspective. You'd really be ok with seeing me? You don't think it would be a conflict of interest since we're friends?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist, mentioning the ups and downs of the profession.\n2. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n3. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n4. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n5. Speaker A works at a stable and enjoys being around horses.\n6. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I would be more than happy to see you as a client. As a therapist, I always maintain professionalism and confidentiality, so our friendship wouldn't be a conflict of interest. It's important to prioritize your mental health, so if you feel like therapy could be beneficial for you, I'm here to help.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information that aligns well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures Speaker B's profession as a therapist, which is the central topic of the dialogue. Memory point 1 highlights the ups and downs of the profession, which connects to Speaker B expressing both the challenges and rewards of therapy. Memory point 6 confirms Speaker B's experience, which can help in reinforcing the credibility of their offer to help Speaker A. Additionally, points 4 and 5 give background information about Speaker A's familiarity with horses, aligning with the dialogue where Speaker A mentions finding therapy in horse riding. However, some details, like Speaker B's interest in football and the Chiefs (point 2), and Freudian theories related to horse ownership (point 3), are less relevant to the immediate context of the dialogue. Despite this, the overall structure allows the language model to understand the relationships and past interactions effectively, with just a few unrelated bits that are clear and easy to dismiss."
