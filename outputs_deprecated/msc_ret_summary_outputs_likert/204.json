    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her? Speaker B: Hi there, hope you are wlll and managing to save up for your Italy trip?  Thank for asking about the Greek mythology study, we are doing very well. It helps because i am so passionate about it and hope to get to the Greek islands soon Speaker A: Yes I have been saving up for another trip to Italy! I can't wait. It's planned for next Spring. Do you have any plans to go back to Italy in the future? Speaker B: I would love to get back to Italy but need to save up and the hopeful priority is to Greece this year.  You have friends in Europe are you in contact to see what plans you can make? Speaker A: Yes I've been talking to them quite a bit so they know what's going on. I'll be staying with some of them while I'm over there. I have never been to Greece....I'd like to go though. Maybe I'll add it to my itinerary! Maybe we could plan to be in Greece at the same time?! Speaker B: That would be so good.  There is so much history and the roman statues i take my daughter to see in the museums and through our local resources is fab.  She is building up the passion which is lovely to see.  Have you still got your hair blue or has it grown out now? Speaker A: That's awesome! Maybe you can teach me a little about all the mythology. I think I've never liked it before only because I didn't understand it. My hair is back to being its natural brown - lol I'm being boring for the moment. Speaker B: Never boring you will keep styling it all sorts of interesting styles im sure.  Yes i would be lovely to be your guide for the day out in Greece.  Bring some decent walking boots and some sun cream, its a different heat out there but your tan is probably topped up with going to the beach each day. Speaker A: That's good advice! Thank you! I saw on the news Cali has been getting a lot of rain. Have you still been able to run on the beach each day?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology.\n2. Speaker A is fascinated by the architecture of Italy and enjoys studying history, especially through reading and watching documentaries.\n3. Speaker A is planning to travel to Italy alone for Spring Break and has friends from Europe meeting up with them.\n4. Speaker B has been to Italy in the past and enjoyed the food there.\n5. Speaker B enjoys Greek mythology and did a case study on Poseidon, the God of the Sea, Earthquakes, and Horses.\n6.

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, we've had a bit of a break from the beach due to the rainy weather, but we try to get out there whenever we can. Hopefully, the sun will come back out soon!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant and useful information that helps inform Speaker B's responses in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it mentions Speaker B's interest in Greek mythology (1, 5), which is relevant to the discussions in the dialogue about Greek mythology and possibly acting as a guide in Greece. The MEMORY also highlights Speaker B's preference for Greece over returning to Italy (1), aligning with their stated priorities in the dialogue. Furthermore, it correctly indicates that Speaker B visits the beach often (6), which ties into the dialogue where they discuss running on the beach. Although some details like Speaker A's fascination with Italian architecture (2) or traveling alone for spring break (3) are not directly addressed in the dialogue, their inclusion is naturally structured and provides a complete understanding of the interests and plans of both speakers. The MEMORY is comprehensive, structured coherently, and provides contextual cues that support the continuity and relevance of Speaker B's responses in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
