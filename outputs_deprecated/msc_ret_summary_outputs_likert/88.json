    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n4. Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy.\n5. Speaker B is not going out drinking much due to their wife's pregnancy.\n6. Speaker B's wife is pregnant and has three more months to go until the due date.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great idea! I'll talk to my wife and see if she's up for it. Thanks for offering the cabin, it would definitely make things easier for her.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provided offers relevant information that can help Speaker A generate a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context involves Speaker B proposing a more comfortable option for attending a bluegrass show due to their wife's pregnancy. The MEMORY clearly states that Speaker B's wife is pregnant (sentences 1 and 6), which directly relates to the context of needing comfort and not drinking (sentence 5). It also shows their mutual interest in bluegrass music (sentence 2) and discusses the logistics concerning the pregnancy (sentence 3). However, while sentence 4 gives some emotional context regarding Speaker B's feelings, itâ€™s less directly relevant to generating a response regarding the decision to attend the festival and use the cabin. Overall, the MEMORY mostly provides a helpful background that is clearly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, supporting a high score."
