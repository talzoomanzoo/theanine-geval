Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well? Speaker B: The older one seems to like it while the youngest cannot be bothered. Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe.\n2. Speaker B's younger son would be jealous of Speaker A's sons' European tour.\n3. Speaker A has two sons who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next.\n4. Speaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite worrying about them traveling far away.\n5. Speaker B is good at ice skating and suggests going to an ice skating rink during winter break.\n6. Speaker B has two sons, one who loves Chinese food like Speaker A, and the other who prefers Italian food.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I wish I could visit them soon, but with work and everything, it's hard to find the time. I'll just have to wait for them to come back for winter break.",
    "prediction": "Explanation for the rating:\n\nThe MEMORY contains several pieces of information about both Speaker A and Speaker B's sons, which could potentially be helpful in structuring a natural and coherent dialogue. Here is a breakdown:\n\n1. Sentence 1 provides direct relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as Speaker A's sons' winter break is potentially related to their visit.\n2. Sentence 2 is not very connected to the conversation; it seems more hypothetical and less likely to guide the upcoming response.\n3. Sentence 3 gives background information about Speaker A's sons studying abroad and planning to visit Italy, which ties into the discussion about visiting Europe.\n4. Sentence 4 offers context for Speaker A's feelings about traveling; while not directly related to the context, it adds depth.\n5. Sentence 5 is quite relevant, as it offers a suggestion based on past interactions that fits with the winter break context.\n6. Sentence 6 is less relevant at this moment, since food preferences aren't being discussed, though it could be useful in other contexts.\n\nIn summary, some sentences, especially 1, 3, and 5, do align well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, providing helpful information. Other sentences, like 2, 4, and 6, add varying degrees of context, though not all are immediately relevant.\n\nHelpfulness Score: 4"
