Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule.\n2. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n3. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n4. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n5. Speaker A's schedule at the restaurant includes working doubles on Saturdays and 8-hour shifts on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.\n6. Speaker A enjoys the interaction with people at work and the variety of experiences that come with it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains details about Speaker A working at a restaurant, which is directly connected to the context where Speaker A mentions their excitement about a new dish being added to the menu at work. Specifically, sentences 1, 2, 3, and 5 provide context about Speaker A's job, their schedule, and their workplace perks, which add depth to why they might be excited about a new dish. Additionally, sentences 4 and 6 give insight into Speaker A's attitude towards their job and the enjoyable aspects he or she finds in the work, which could help Speaker B respond appropriately. The sentences are clear, naturally structured, and demonstrate causality and relevancy, making it easier for the language model to align them with the context provided. However, not every aspect of MEMORY is relevant to the context—for example, Speaker A's work schedule or inviting Speaker B to visit—but these are still naturally phrased and not disruptive. This leads to a score of 4."
