Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far. Speaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes.  Speaker A: why don't you like books like that? Speaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has a son and enjoys reading books, particularly about animals.\n2. Speaker B is fascinated by animals and can relate to Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals.\n3. Speaker A has grandchildren and enjoys watching movies with them.\n4. Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix.\n5. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n6. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context that is relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A having grandchildren (Memory 3, 4, 5, 6) and enjoying reading books (Memory 4). This supports the part of the dialogue where Speaker A mentions reading instead of watching the grandkids. Additionally, the MEMORY reveals Speaker B's interest in animal books (Memory 1), which aligns with Speaker Bâ€™s statement in the dialogue about preferring animal books. However, the MEMORY lacks a clear, naturally connected structure that would demonstrate the development or causality of past interactions. Information about Speaker B having a son is not relevant, and Memory 2's reference to \"comparison of grandchildren to animals\" doesn't directly relate to the dialogue. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it clearly demonstrated more of the past interactions or consistently relevant details influencing the current context. Overall, it provides some helpful details, but not in the most efficient or comprehensively connected manner."
