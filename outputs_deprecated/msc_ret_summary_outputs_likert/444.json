    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive. Speaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price? Speaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B have a friendly interaction and part ways on a positive note.\n2. Speaker B believes that luxurious items distract from the value of their family.\n3. Speaker A enjoys the peace and quiet of country life, the fresh produce, and fresh air.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n5. Speaker B appreciates the convenience of city living but also values what the country has to offer.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY entries provide some information about the relationship and past topics of discussion between Speaker A and Speaker B. However, few of them are directly relevant or helpful for generating a response to the given dialogue context. The first sentence suggests that Speaker A and B have a friendly relationship, but it is too generic to offer much help in crafting a specific response. The third and fifth sentences touch on lifestyle preferences (country vs. city), which could vaguely inform the dialogue context if connected more explicitly to the purchase of the iPhone. Sentences 2, 4, and 6 discuss luxury items and lottery tickets but do not have clear connections to the current dialogue about the new iPhone. Overall, while the memory reflects some aspects of past interactions, it does not effectively support the generation of a contextually appropriate and relevant response in the given scenario."
