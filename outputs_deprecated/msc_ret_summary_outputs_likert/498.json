Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play?  Speaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is in a band and plays music, possibly a musician.\n2. Speaker A enjoys surfing and music as a way to escape from daily life.\n3. Speaker A is in a band where they play the drums and write music, with 4 members including the singer who is their best friend.\n4. Speaker A is part of a band that tours different countries for their music.\n5. Speaker A wants to see Sublime live one day but doesn't go to many concerts other than the ones their band plays in.\n6. Speaker A was good at writing in school, while Speaker B was bad at math and preferred fishing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information about Speaker A that could be useful in generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, several points hint at Speaker A's musical background, which relates to the current conversation about music and instruments. For instance, MEMORY entries 1, 3, and 4 describe Speaker A's involvement in a band, which could help generate a dialogue about band experiences or preferences in music. However, these memories are not directly aligned with the specific question about what instrument either speaker plays in the present moment, which limits their direct relevance.\n\nAdditionally, while there is a clear focus on Speaker A's music-related activities, the causal or developmental relationship between these memories and the current dialogue is not strongly demonstrated. The sentence about Speaker B's preference for fishing and dislike for math (entry 6) does not contribute to the development of the current interaction about music preferences, rendering it mostly irrelevant.\n\nGiven these considerations, the MEMORY provides moderate help to inform the language model's response, justifying a middle score. The memories are naturally structured, but they don't fully meet the criterion of clear causality or development directly related to the current context."
