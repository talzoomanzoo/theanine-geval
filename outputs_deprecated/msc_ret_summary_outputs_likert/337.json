    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has grandchildren and enjoys watching movies with them.\n2. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n3. Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix.\n4. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n5. Speaker A enjoys watching Jeopardy with their grandchildren and cooking for them, with the busiest time being the weekend.\n6. Speaker B has a son and enjoys reading books, particularly about animals.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great way to relax. I've been reading a lot of animal-related books lately, but a good crime drama sounds intriguing.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker A, particularly regarding their grandchildren and reading habits, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A mentions not watching their grandkids that day and checking out a book. Specifically, MEMORY points 1, 3, and 4 are somewhat helpful by linking Speaker A's interest in reading and their grandchildren, which can help Speaker B's response feel more personalized or connected. However, MEMORY also includes details that aren't directly related or useful for the current CONTEXT, like watching movies (point 1) or watching Jeopardy (point 5), and information about Speaker B (point 6) that doesn't benefit the current context. The connections and relevancy between past interactions and the current dialogue could be clearer and more directly useful, meriting a middle-ground score."
