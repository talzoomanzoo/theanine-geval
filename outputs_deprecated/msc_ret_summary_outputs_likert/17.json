Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun! Speaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim.  Speaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you  Speaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises. Speaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you? Speaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it. Speaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has planned a cruise to the Caribbeans.\n2. Speaker A has planned to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n4. Speaker A plans to travel to the Caribbean for their next trip.\n5. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n6. Speaker A enjoys the food and the adventure of cruises.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides contextually relevant information that helps to generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1, 3, and 4 highlight Speaker A's excitement and plans related to a cruise, which aligns well with the current dialogue where they discuss a trip to the Caribbean. Sentence 5 connects to the playlist creation and Speaker B's musical preferences, which were talked about in the context. These memories demonstrate the development of past interactions and will help the language model to engage in conversations considering Speaker A’s travel plans and Speaker B’s interests. However, sentence 6 is more generalized and doesn’t directly enhance the current dialogue. Overall, the relevant sentences are naturally phrased, and the development and causality between sentences are clear."
