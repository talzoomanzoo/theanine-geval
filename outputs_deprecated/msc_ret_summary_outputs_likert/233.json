Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you. Speaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them Speaker A: IN MY HOME?! A TREE? That was not at all what I was thinking. Do they grow well indoors? I am intrigued.  Speaker B: Well if you want to make it like a proper garden experience then I would suggest going all in, and go for the best most authentic looking items you could get  Speaker A: Wow! Ok! This is sounding like a bigger undertaking! Should I embrace bugs in the home if they help the plants or am I getting wild?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing.\n2. Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden.\n3. Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more.\n4. Speaker A jokes about space weeds and expresses a desire to see space.\n5. Speaker B is also interested in space exploration and plant science, expressing concerns about the fuels used for space travel.\n6. Speaker B jokes about sending space weeds into space and enjoys the idea of it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Embracing bugs indoors might be a bit too wild, but having some indoor plants can definitely enhance your space and gardening experience! How about starting with some low-maintenance plants to see how you like it?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several relevant elements that can aid Speaker B in generating a response. Notably, Speaker A's struggle with gardening and Speaker B's knowledge about plants are useful for understanding the current dialogue context. Additionally, Speaker A's interest in space plants and Speaker B's interest in space exploration might contribute to the suggestion of a unique gardening approach in the current conversation. However, some details, like jokes about space weeds and concerns about fuels for space travel, do not provide direct support for the immediate conversation about indoor gardening and handling bugs. Thus, while the MEMORY contains several connected and relevant pieces of information, there are also some that are not directly beneficial for continuing the dialogue."
