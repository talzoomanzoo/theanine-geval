Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet?  Speaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name? Speaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended.  Speaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along! Speaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them. Speaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me! Speaker A: Hahaha. Yes I agree its too hot to get a long hike in. I've been on some short ones, but the bugs eat me alive. I like to hike in the fall when the bugs are dying off and its a little cooler. Speaker B: Ah yes, that's my favorite time of year. Oh and speaking of Tasha, I'm still amazed she knows Mandarin. Have you been learning more of the language? Speaker A: I've been learning a little more. I try to learn a few things a day. Tasha's reactions to my talking to myself in Mandarin is funny, she looks confused most of the time.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a pet named Tasha who speaks Mandarin.\n2. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n3. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n4. Speaker A has been learning Mandarin and Tasha has started saying Chinese phrases instead of English ones.\n5. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n6. Speaker B finds it amusing that Tasha speaks Mandarin and mutters things under her breath.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's so funny how pets react to new things. Tasha must think you're talking to her in a different language!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY contains several sentences that are relevant and potentially helpful for generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1, 2, and 4 provide context about Tasha, the parrot, who speaks Mandarin, and Speaker A's interest in adopting a rescue kitten, which ties back to the dialogue about adopting kittens and the parrot's interactions with them. Sentence 6 also ties into the conversation about Tasha speaking Mandarin. However, sentences 3 and 5 introduce information about Speaker B that was not present in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the adoption paperwork and giving Mandarin names based on personalities, which could cause confusion as they do not align with the context provided. The MEMORY overall maintains a level of coherence but includes some information that doesn't clearly correlate with the given dialogue, slightly affecting its overall helpfulness."
