Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself! Speaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A's pet raccoon enjoys eating pizza.\n2. Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B share a love for music and plan to have a house concert with their pets.\n4. Speaker B enjoys going on cruises for fun.\n5. Speaker A's friend found two baby raccoons in her yard, one of which was given to Speaker A to keep as a pet.\n6. Speaker A is not interested in going on a cruise and would prefer camping as a vacation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe memory contains several sentences that provide relevant and helpful context for generating a response to the dialogue context. Sentence 1 directly relates to the current dialogue about Journey, Speaker A's pet raccoon, eating pizza, thus providing essential details that help understand the situation. Sentence 2 adds more relevant information by confirming that Journey is indeed the name of Speaker A's raccoon and introduces another pet, which may or may not become relevant later. Sentence 5 gives background on how Speaker A came to have Journey, adding depth but not directly impacting the immediate dialogue. \n\nSentences 3, 4, and 6 are less relevant to the immediate topic of Journey and the pizza incident, but they provide a broader understanding of the interests and dynamics between Speaker A and Speaker B. These ancillary details are phrased in a way that lets a language model easily discern their relevance or lack thereof to the current conversation. However, because these do not strongly contribute to the immediate discussion, the score is not a 5. Overall, the memory is quite helpful but has room for improvement in direct relevance to the specific conversation topic."
