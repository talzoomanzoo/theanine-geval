Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play?  Speaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music. Speaker A: ah right, who's your favourite rock band?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is in a band and plays music, possibly a musician.\n2. Speaker A is in a band where they play the drums and write music, with 4 members including the singer who is their best friend.\n3. Speaker A is part of a band that tours different countries for their music.\n4. Speaker A is planning a concert in Denver and offers to get tickets for Speaker B.\n5. Speaker A wants to see Sublime live one day but doesn't go to many concerts other than the ones their band plays in.\n6. Speaker A enjoys surfing and music as a way to escape from daily life.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "My favorite rock band is definitely Guns N' Roses. Their music just speaks to me on another level.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY contains several points about Speaker A's involvement in music and their band, which is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A is asked about their favorite rock band. However, the MEMORY points do not directly relate to Speaker B's lack of musical ability or their enjoyment of rock music. While the information about Speaker A's band and their experiences with music could help generate a response, such as sharing more about the band or suggesting bands similar to Sublime, the details are not directly connected to the current conversation. Additionally, while the sentences are naturally structured, they are more focused on Speaker A's personal experiences rather than interactions with Speaker B, which limits their helpfulness in creating a dialogic response in the given context."
