Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden. Speaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways? Speaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there? Speaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot.  Speaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n4. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B discussed the differences between Sweden and the US, including coffee breaks.\n6. Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I would love to go back to Sweden someday, but the expenses are always a concern. Hopefully, I can make it happen soon!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, sentences 2 and 3 mention that Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden, which aligns with Speaker A's statement in the dialogue about their cousin helping with the planning. Sentence 4 adds depth by showing Speaker B's emotional connection to Sweden, which can be useful for Speaker B's character development in the response generation. Sentence 6 explains why Speaker B has not visited Sweden recently, which can contribute to the conversation if Speaker B is asked about their travel plans. Sentences 1 and 5, though not directly referenced in the current dialogue context, are structured naturally and do not detract from understanding the past interactions between the speakers. Overall, the MEMORY provides a coherent backdrop that supports generating a natural and contextually relevant response."
