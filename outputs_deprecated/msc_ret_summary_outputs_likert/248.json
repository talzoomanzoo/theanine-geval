Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden. Speaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discussed the differences between Sweden and the US, including coffee breaks.\n4. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n5. Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n6. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've been saving up money for the trip, and I'm getting closer to being able to visit my cousin in Sweden. It's definitely taking some time, but I'm determined to make it happen.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information that is relevant and can assist in generating a proper response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The details about Speaker A and Speaker B planning a trip to Sweden together, Speaker A considering visiting a cousin in Sweden, the need to save money, and the fact that neither has visited Sweden recently, provide useful context for a conversation about the trip. These elements establish past interactions and contribute to a natural flow of dialogue about planning and experiences related to Sweden. However, there is some repetition with the point about the cousin, which detracts slightly from the seamless connection of information. Overall, the MEMORY is helpful and mostly well-structured for the given context."
