Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and their brother enjoy going to a Brazilian steakhouse for dinner.\n2. Speaker A's brother enjoys Brazilian food, specifically steak.\n3. Speaker A is involved in healing work and mentioned hot latina salsa.\n4. Speaker A enjoys salsa dancing and is planning to go out dancing.\n5. Speaker A is planning to take their clients salsa dancing for fun.\n6. Speaker A plans to grab dinner with their brother before dancing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information that can be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n- Sentences 1 and 2 regarding Speaker A and their brother enjoying Brazilian food, particularly at a steakhouse, connect to the context where Speaker A mentions enjoying Brazilian food after watching the Black Widow movie. This relevance provides helpful background on Speaker A's culinary preferences and shared experiences with their brother.\n  \n- Sentence 6 mentions plans to grab dinner with their brother, which is indicative of Speaker A's habit of sharing meals with their brother, reinforcing the bond seen in the context.\n\nHowever, the rest of the MEMORY (sentences 3, 4, and 5) mainly focus on Speaker A's interest in salsa dancing, which does not directly pertain to the immediate DIALOGUE CONTEXT discussing the Black Widow movie and Brazilian food. The connection to Speaker A's dining habits is less clear, thus rendering them less instantly useful for generating a contextually coherent response. \n\nOverall, while there's a degree of relevance that can enhance the language model's understanding of Speaker A's preferences and context, the MEMORY could be improved by focusing more on direct connections to the specific dialogue context provided."
