Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens? Speaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month Speaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.  Where are you going on vacation? Speaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there! Speaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo? Speaker B: Their zoo is pretty good! It's always crowded, of course, but they have pandas so I'm happy. I would say it's bigger than the DC zoo, but I like that the DC zoo has fewer people.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo.\n2. Speaker B's girlfriend enjoys pandas and penguins at the zoo, and they go to the zoo every few weeks.\n3. Speaker A has been to the zoo before and enjoys seeing exotic birds.\n4. Speaker A enjoys seeing pandas and penguins at the zoo and goes with their sister.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss hobbies and interests, with Speaker A enjoying gardening and reading, and Speaker B enjoying visiting the zoo.\n6. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "3\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some relevant pieces of information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is not well-structured or explicitly helpful for generating the next response. \n\n- Sentence 1 mentions that Speaker B enjoys visiting the zoo, which connects to the dialogue context where Speaker B is excited about visiting the San Diego Zoo. However, the mention of a cat with kittens might be misleading, as it's actually Speaker A's friend's kittens that are being discussed in the context.\n- Sentence 2 relates to zoos and mentions pandas, a point already relevant in the context; however, it wrongly attributes the panda enjoyment to Speaker B's girlfriend, which is not present in the dialogue context.\n- Sentence 5 provides some context for shared interests, but it diverges from the specific conversation about vacation and zoos.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY includes relevant themes like zoos and kittens but lacks coherence and accuracy in representing past interactions related to the current conversation."
