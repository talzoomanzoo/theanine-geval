Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam? Speaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A. Speaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now? Speaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done.  Speaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on? Speaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring.\n2. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n3. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n4. Speaker B has been getting all A's in the sports medicine class.\n5. Speaker A wishes to get better grades and is hopeful for a soccer scholarship.\n6. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the fact that Speaker A struggles with history and is concerned about their grades. This could explain their satisfaction with a B in history and their interest in improving their grades. Additionally, knowing that Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain good grades can give context to Speaker B's supportive attitude towards Speaker A's academic struggles. However, not all of the MEMORY is directly relevant to the current conversation about exams, history, and studying, such as Speaker B's sports medicine training and the specifics about Speaker A's gym class efforts. The MEMORY includes relevant information but could be more directly connected to the current dialogue, making it moderately helpful."
