Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me? Speaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week? Speaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day Speaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through Speaker A: Actually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested. Speaker B: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to it. Do you think I will need to rent a car when I'm there, or is it possible to walk and bike in the summer? I always picture huge amounts of snow but I'm not sure if it's like that all year round.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plans to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit.\n2. Speaker B is planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n3. Speaker A has invited Speaker B to visit them and is excited about the trip.\n4. Speaker A invited Speaker B to visit and mentioned looking into flights.\n5. Speaker B found flights that work for their schedule and price and will be visiting Speaker A in a couple of weeks.\n6. Speaker A has visited Alaska and describes it as beautiful, suggesting cheap flights to Anchorage.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "You definitely won't need to rent a car while you're here. Anchorage is very walkable and bike-friendly in the summer! And don't worry, the snow is mostly gone by then. It's a beautiful time to explore the city on foot or bike.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: MEMORY contains relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, with elements that link both the past interactions and the current dialogue like planning activities during Speaker B's visit and Speaker B's interest in attending a concert. However, some elements are extraneous or a bit redundant, such as Speaker A's unrelated trip to Alaska and previously resolved issues like finding flights that suit Speaker B's schedule. Sentence 5 contradicts the context, as Speaker B hasn't confirmed flight plans yet. The sentences offer moderately helpful context but could be structured more concisely, clearly showing the flow from invitation to planning the visit. Overall, the MEMORY provides some value but could benefit from more precise alignment with the ongoing dialogue."
