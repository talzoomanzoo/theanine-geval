Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company? Do you build computers or work on programming? Speaker B: I do like my job. My job is to troubleshoot issues between the hardware and software, so I get to work with both. Speaker A: That sounds interesting. That's great that you love your job, not many people do. Speaker B: Love is a strong word! I do like it though. There have been jobs I hated and I'm great full not be in that place. Hows you job going? Speaker A: Its going good. Its summer so we are really busy right now. I am just grateful to be back at work. How long have you worked for your company?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A works for a small local business with a demanding schedule.\n2. Speaker B works for a computer company and is unable to change careers until their child graduates.\n3. Speaker A enjoys reading books about ice cream, Disney World, and computers.\n4. Speaker A considers quitting their job to work at Disney World.\n5. Speaker A is considering a career in dentistry but is also interested in working at Disney for happiness.\n6. Speaker A is torn between choosing a career in dentistry for the money or working at Disney for happiness.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly regarding the context of work and career plans. It indicates that Speaker B works for a computer company, aligning with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B discusses their job at a computer company and troubleshooting tasks. However, most of the MEMORY focuses on Speaker A's career considerations and interests, which are not directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT involving Speaker B's job and present work situation. Although the information about Speaker A's career and interests offers background detail, it is less pertinent to the immediate context and does not clearly connect to the natural progression of the current dialogue. The MEMORY is structured in a way that allows for easy identification of contextual cues, but the relevancy to directly aid the response in the current dialogue is moderate."
