Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college? Speaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position.  Speaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys playing soccer but is not into music.\n2. Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n3. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.\n4. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n5. Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n6. Speaker A is a fan of Arsenal and enjoys watching international teams play.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I definitely miss the rush of making those crucial saves, but I still get my soccer fix by watching games and cheering for Manchester United.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information about soccer, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where both speakers are discussing their experiences and positions related to the sport. For example, sentence 4 provides context regarding Speaker B's background in soccer, which relates to the conversation about playing positions in college. However, most of Speaker A's related memories (sentences 1, 2, 3, 5, 6) pertain to Speaker Aâ€™s current soccer activities rather than Speaker B's college experience or feelings, which are the primary focus of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The connections between the sentences could be tighter, and relevant memories about Speaker B rather than Speaker A would improve the helpfulness score. Nonetheless, the soccer-related details do provide some useful context."
