Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week? Speaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you? Speaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions? Speaker B: Unfortunately I mainly play games similar to RE. I don't know why I like them so much. I remember when I was little my brother play Doom and it gave me nightmares for a week. What genre of games you like? Speaker A: I like all kinds of games. I like party, fighting, RPGs, shooters, action, adventure, and puzzle games. I enjoy playing Jurassic Park: World but I'd like to find another game to play. The storm means I'll be inside for a bit, so I think I'll curl up with some pizza and just zone out. Do you like to do anything else besides game when it's rainy?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n2. Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World.\n3. Speaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII.\n4. Speaker B mentions that Resident Evil can be scary and provides some tips for playing it.\n5. Speaker A prefers tamer video games and is not a fan of horror movies.\n6. Speaker A does not play video games often but may consider trying them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is inconsistent in its relevance and structure. \n\n1. Sentence 1 is somewhat helpful as it connects to the context where both speakers discuss video games and trying out Resident Evil. However, it assumes a planned gaming session together, which hasn't been mentioned in the dialogue context.\n\n2. Sentence 2 accurately captures Speaker A's hesitation towards scary games and preference for Jurassic Park: World, which aligns with the dialogue where Speaker A expresses not liking scary games but playing them a little due to the storm.\n\n3. Sentence 3 is partially relevant, as it notes Speaker B's general gaming preferences, including Resident Evil, but it adds League of Legends, which is not mentioned in the current context.\n\n4. Sentence 4 gives a useful piece of context with tips for playing Resident Evil, which aligns with the dialogue that discusses scary games but lacks a direct link to Speaker A's query for game suggestions.\n\n5. Sentence 5 aligns with Speaker A's stated preferences against scary games, but it doesn't add new information beyond the stated preference for non-horror games.\n\n6. Sentence 6 is less helpful as it doesn't directly relate to this specific context since Speaker A actively engages in discussions about games to play during the storm.\n\nOverall, while MEMORY captures some elements related to the dialogue, such as game preferences and attitudes, it doesn't provide a clear development of interactions nor entirely captures the exact context of the ongoing conversation. Some details could potentially confuse rather than assist in generating an appropriate next response."
