Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships! Speaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!   I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field? Speaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate? Speaker B: I have another year- so this year is really important I get internships and start making connections in the field.   I love going to the beach too.  What happened with your knees that now cause you so much pain? Speaker A: I think age has really been my knees downfall. I also used to hike a lot and I put a lot of pressure on my legs. That is great that you only have a year. Maybe when you graduate you can come hang out on the beach with me. I can't surf but I would love to watch you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is offering advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field.\n2. Speaker B is interested in sports medicine and enjoys surfing.\n3. Speaker A suggests that surfing could be a way for Speaker B to make connections in the medical field.\n4. Speaker A enjoys hiking along the coast and collecting shells, mentioning that their knees can't handle much else.\n5. Speaker B is looking for internships in the sports medicine field and has asked professors for letters of recommendation.\n6. Speaker B jokes about pretending to get hurt surfing to meet a doctor, showing a sense of humor and creativity.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a plan! I'll make sure to show off my surfing skills once I graduate. Maybe I'll even pretend to wipe out just to meet a doctor, who knows!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant elements, such as mentioning Speaker B's interest in sports medicine and the pursuit of internships, aligning with Speaker B's focus on securing an internship in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY also includes several pieces of information that do not clearly align with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, the suggestion from Speaker A about surfing to make connections and the joke about meeting a doctor while surfing, do not connect well with the ongoing conversation about the challenges of finding internships. The sentences are fragmented in terms of demonstrating the development or causality of interactions between the speakers. Additionally, some details, such as Speaker A collecting shells and hiking, do not add value or offer contextual cues for the next response in the dialogue. The MEMORY, overall, lacks coherence in supporting a response and thus scores lower in helpfulness."
