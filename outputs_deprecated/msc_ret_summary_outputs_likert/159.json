Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet?  Speaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name? Speaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended.  Speaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along! Speaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them. Speaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me! Speaker A: Hahaha. Yes I agree its too hot to get a long hike in. I've been on some short ones, but the bugs eat me alive. I like to hike in the fall when the bugs are dying off and its a little cooler. Speaker B: Ah yes, that's my favorite time of year. Oh and speaking of Tasha, I'm still amazed she knows Mandarin. Have you been learning more of the language?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n2. Speaker A has a pet named Tasha who speaks Mandarin.\n3. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n4. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n5. Speaker A is interested in training tips for the kittens and is open to adopting one despite having a parrot.\n6. Speaker A's parrot Tasha has seen cats before and ignores them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I haven't been actively learning more Mandarin, but I've been trying to reinforce the words Tasha already knows. It's always impressive to see her pick up new phrases!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides largely relevant and important information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Key points from the MEMORY include that Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha who speaks Mandarin, and Speaker A is considering adopting rescue kittens, which align well with the discussion about pets and potential interactions between the parrot and cats. These help in understanding Speaker A's situation and interests. The mention of Tasha knowing Mandarin also relates to the conversation where Speaker B expresses amazement at Tasha's skills. However, there is a small inaccuracy about Speaker B filling out adoption paperwork and considering Mandarin names â€“ this wasn't discussed in the context. The MEMORY is largely structured in a way that facilitates understanding of past interactions but slightly strays in some points. Overall, it earns a score of 4 due to its relevance and cohesion, although not perfect."
