Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make? Speaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it. Speaker A: I would love to, I enjoy cooking so maybe you can teach me to make it, too?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe.\n2. Speaker A likes cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally.\n3. Speaker A enjoys cooking and finds it helpful for stress relief.\n4. Speaker A plays the drums and loves making food for others.\n5. Speaker A cooked steak, fried potatoes, and shrimp for dinner with their father.\n6. Speaker A enjoys surfing and offers to give Speaker B lessons.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Sure, I'd be happy to teach you how to make it! Cooking together could be a fun experience. Let's plan a cooking day soon.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 1 clearly articulates Speaker B's enjoyment in cooking for loved ones and relates to the garlic chicken recipe mentioned in the dialogue. This development provides a connection to the conversation about cooking spicy foods, directly benefiting the language model's ability to generate a contextually appropriate response. Sentence 2 reflects Speaker A's interest in cooking new dishes, which aligns with A's willingness to learn new recipes from Speaker B. While some of the sentences (like 3, 4, and 5) may not directly connect to the immediate context of cooking spicy foods, they are naturally phrased and provide additional context about Speaker A's personality and interests. Sentence 6, while unrelated to the cooking topic, offers insight into another aspect of Speaker A's hobbies, which could be useful in a broader dialogue context. Overall, there are clear, naturally structured memories relevant to the current conversation, supporting a high level of usefulness."
