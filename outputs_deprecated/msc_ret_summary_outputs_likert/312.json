Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens? Speaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month Speaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.  Where are you going on vacation? Speaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there! Speaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo? Speaker B: Their zoo is pretty good! It's always crowded, of course, but they have pandas so I'm happy. I would say it's bigger than the DC zoo, but I like that the DC zoo has fewer people. Speaker A: That sounds awesome.  I haven't been to the zoo in so long.  I wish I could go. Speaker B: You should go with your sister! she can bring her dog. They probably have all kinds of exotic birds... Speaker A: That's a great idea!  I'm not sure how good her dog would do around other animals though.  She always barks like crazy whenever she sees any kind of animal. Speaker B: Oh, that's a good point. Maybe keep her away from the small rodent house and reptiles, eh? Speaker A: For sure.  Hopefully she'll be more curious than aggressive.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo.\n2. Speaker A enjoys seeing pandas and penguins at the zoo and goes with their sister.\n3. Speaker A has been to the zoo before and enjoys seeing exotic birds.\n4. Speaker B's girlfriend enjoys pandas and penguins at the zoo, and they go to the zoo every few weeks.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss hobbies and interests, with Speaker A enjoying gardening and reading, and Speaker B enjoying visiting the zoo.\n6. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Several key points from the MEMORY are applicable to the context:\n\n1. The mention of Speaker B considering adopting a kitten (sentence 6) correlates with the opening question about getting a kitten.\n2. Speaker B's enjoyment of visiting the zoo (sentences 1 and 5) aligns with the discussion about the San Diego Zoo, contributing to the conversation's development.\n3. Speaker A's enjoyment of seeing exotic birds at the zoo (sentence 3) fits with the dialogue about Speaker A's sister bringing her dog to see different animals.\n4. The MEMORY misattributes some interests or facts, like Speaker A's alleged enjoyment of pandas (sentence 2) and the regularity of Speaker B's zoo visits (sentence 4), which do not align perfectly with the context.\n\nDespite these minor inaccuracies, the MEMORY is generally well-connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and provides a helpful foundation for generating a coherent and contextually relevant response. The development and relevancy of sentences regarding the zoo visit help Speaker B craft a proper response."
