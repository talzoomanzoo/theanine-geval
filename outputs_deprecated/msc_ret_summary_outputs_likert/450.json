Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive. Speaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price? Speaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music Speaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it. Speaker A: I'll keep trying! Have you had any luck lately? Speaker B: No I haven't! I keep hoping that I will so I can buy my dreamhouse but I know the chances are low. Speaker A: Would you move to the city? It'd be too much for me Speaker B: I would love to be able to have a country house and a city house to be able to come and go to each one as I please. doesn't that sound like a dream come true? Speaker A: It would be convenient for seeing concerts in the city, yes. I'm not used to the business, though\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both speakers dream of having a city and country house or a summer and winter home.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n4. Speaker B appreciates the convenience of city living but also values what the country has to offer.\n5. Both speakers acknowledge the pros and cons of city and country living.\n6. Speaker A used to live in a suburb of DC and misses the convenience of city life.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some helpful information that relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is not entirely aligned with it. For instance, the MEMORY item that mentions both speakers dreaming of having city and country houses aligns well with the current conversation about potentially having houses in both settings. More specifically, MEMORY items 1 and 4 provide some context regarding their discussion about city and country living. MEMORY item 2 and 3 offer potential background information on the lottery discussion in DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, these items are not fully aligned with the dialogue's focus, which mainly revolves around buying an iPhone, music, and city living. MEMORY item 6 is not reflected in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and doesn't seem relevant for a language model to generate the next response. The MEMORY would be more helpful if it were more closely connected to specific points in the current dialogue, rather than general topics. The natural phrasing of the MEMORY allows for the language model to identify connections, but the connections themselves could be stronger to earn a higher score."
