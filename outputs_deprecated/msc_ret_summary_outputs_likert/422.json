Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone?  Speaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!). Speaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600.\n2. Speaker B is a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks.\n3. Speaker B has run a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding.\n4. Speaker B's job involves motivating people to be successful and follow their dreams.\n5. Speaker B got into motivational speaking because they needed it themselves to battle depression and anxiety.\n6. Speaker A is training for marathons and seeking advice on how to recover.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY provides rich contextual information that is highly beneficial for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It clearly outlines the relationship and past interactions between Speaker A and Speaker B, particularly focusing on Speaker B's expertise as a motivational speaker and their personal connection to running and marathons. The memory contains detailed and relevant sentences: \n\n- Sentence 1 connects to the current dialogue where running and motivation are discussed, indicating prior plans to run and train for a marathon together.\n- Sentences 2, 4, and 5 elaborate on Speaker B's professional background and personal journey, which align with A's request for a motivational speaker.\n- Sentence 3 demonstrates Speaker B's experience with marathons, reinforcing their ability to motivate runners.\n- Sentence 6 highlights Speaker A's current training endeavors, aligning with the discussion of needing motivation due to hot weather.\n\nEach sentence contributes naturally to understanding the development and connection between the speakers, making the memory comprehensive and directly relevant to the current exchange."
