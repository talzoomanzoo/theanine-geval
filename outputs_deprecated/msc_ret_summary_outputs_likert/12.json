Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun! Speaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n2. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n3. Speaker B is looking forward to eating a pizza burger in a pool with punk music playing.\n4. Speaker A finds swimming relaxing and uses it to destress from their job.\n5. Speaker B does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies.\n6. Speaker A recommends hiking and exploring the local area for those who can't swim.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Don't worry, I'll teach you step by step. Swimming can be really relaxing, you'll enjoy it once you get the hang of it. And if not, we can always explore the local area or watch some swimming movies together!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information that are somewhat helpful but not entirely cohesive or directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Some useful points include Speaker B's enjoyment of punk music (Sentence 1) and their lack of swimming ability (Sentence 5), which align with the context of Speaker A making a playlist including punk music and the mention of swimming intentions. However, other aspects, such as the liking for pizza burgers (Sentence 3), and teaching programming (Sentence 2), don't have a direct relationship with the ongoing conversation, which reduces the overall helpfulness. The sentences are fairly naturally structured and offer some development of their past interactions, but not comprehensively so, warranting a middle score."
