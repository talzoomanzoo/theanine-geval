Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids? Speaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call! Speaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has grandkids who are more interested in phones and tablets than musical instruments.\n2. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n3. Speaker A's other children are addicted to tablets and phones, unlike the youngest one who is interested in music.\n4. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n5. Speaker B mentions having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B both acknowledge the decline in interest and use of libraries due to the rise of the internet.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's a tough balance, isn't it? Sometimes the traditional ways of communication just feel more personal. But it's great that you're making the effort to stay connected with your family, even with your busy schedule.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that can be helpful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is not extremely well-organized or directly connected to the current conversation. The MEMORY does establish that Speaker B has grandkids, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as they're discussing interactions with grandchildren. Several memory points (1, 4, 5) relate to Speaker B's experiences and viewpoints on using technology or traditional means of communication with their grandkids. However, not all points are strongly relevant or interconnected with the current dialogue (e.g., points about Speaker A's children and technology preferences, broader societal trends). The MEMORY could be more concise and exhibit clearer causality or development related to Speaker B's conversation topic, but it does provide some useful context."
