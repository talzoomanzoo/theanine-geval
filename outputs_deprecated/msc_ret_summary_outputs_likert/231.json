    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you. Speaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them Speaker A: IN MY HOME?! A TREE? That was not at all what I was thinking. Do they grow well indoors? I am intrigued. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing.\n2. Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden.\n3. Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more.\n4. Speaker A jokes about space weeds and expresses a desire to see space.\n5. Speaker A plays the clarinet in a band concert and has a solar investment for their office building.\n6. Speaker A's parents are teachers.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "While fruit trees like plum and pear trees typically need to be planted outdoors for proper growth, there are some dwarf varieties that can be kept indoors in containers. You might want to consider some indoor plants that are more manageable in a home setting. How about starting with some easy-to-care-for houseplants like pothos or spider plants?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides limited helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While it does indicate that Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening (Sentence 2), which is somewhat relevant to the discussion about gardening suggestions, the remainder of the MEMORY does not connect well to the current conversation. Sentences like Speaker A struggling with gardening or making jokes about space plants (Sentences 1 and 4) have some peripheral relevance, but do not directly contribute to developing the current dialogue. The other details about Speakers A and B are not well connected to the current dialogue context and do not aid in generating a more informed response about indoor planting suggestions. The lack of cohesive context development and direct relevance to the current dialog makes this more challenging for a model to utilize effectively."
