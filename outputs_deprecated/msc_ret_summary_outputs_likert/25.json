Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok?  Speaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish? Speaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus! Speaker B: Oh that sounds absolutely fabulous. Are you going to get a free dessert, as well?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n2. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n3. Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule.\n4. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n5. Speaker B loves the beach and Mediterranean food.\n6. Speaker A's schedule at the restaurant includes working doubles on Saturdays and 8-hour shifts on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I wish I could, but unfortunately, the free meals don't include dessert. But I do get to take home any leftover baked goods, so I always have a sweet treat waiting for me after my shifts.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information about Speaker A's job at the restaurant, which is pertinent to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where they discuss a dish available at Speaker A's workplace. There is also helpful context provided about Speaker A's benefits of working there (e.g., getting two free meals per week), which directly relates to Speaker A's excitement about trying the dish. However, several other details, such as Speaker B's preferences and specifics of Speaker A's work schedule, do not contribute directly to the current dialogue in a significant way and do not showcase past interaction development directly corresponding to the ongoing discussion. While the MEMORY provides a good amount of relevant content, it lacks a clear, coherent connection between all memory points and current dialogue, limiting its helpfulness."
