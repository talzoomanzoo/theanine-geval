Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for. Speaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for? Speaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work? Speaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol Speaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n3. Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\n4. Speaker A is looking for a job and new camping gear, specifically a hammock.\n5. Speaker A will use the money earned from the store to buy the hammock online.\n6. Speaker B's neighbor, John, is getting divorced and selling top-of-the-line camping gear.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've always been interested in photography, so I'm considering pursuing that as a career. But for now, I'm just trying to save up some money and figure things out. It's always good to have some extra cash coming in, especially with the uncertainty of job situations.",
    "prediction": "3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful context for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it's not fully cohesive. The memory offers additional background on Speaker A's job application (e.g., the store's location near a hiking trail), which adds a bit of context. It also reveals Speaker A's recent high school graduation and interest in camping gear like a hammock, tying into Speaker B's neighbor, John, selling camping equipment. However, the connection between these details and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT isn't entirely clear or strong. The information about Speaker B's friend working at the store and Speaker B's neighbor's divorce is less relevant, and there could be a stronger linking thread among the memories concerning the current conversation. Furthermore, while the separate snippets offer a broader picture of the characters, they aren't naturally connected to the immediate dialogue or each other, which affects how helpful this MEMORY is for generating subsequent responses."
