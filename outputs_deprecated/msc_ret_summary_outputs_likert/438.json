Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for. Speaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for? Speaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work? Speaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol Speaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise?  Speaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows. Speaker A: That sounds wonderful! You'd get to just be out in nature all day. Sounds like a great job, especially if you're a bit introverted like me. That's why hiking is my favorite -- a good solitary activity.  Speaker B: Yes, I agree. What kind of hours would this new job have?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker A is looking for a job and new camping gear, specifically a hammock.\n3. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n4. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking, mentioning setting up a hammock at their campsite.\n5. Speaker B enjoys camping, hiking, and is kind, caring, and hopeful for group equality.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning to go hiking together this weekend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's mostly evening shifts, which is perfect for me since I love watching the sunset while camping. But I'll definitely need to figure out how to balance work and hiking trips like the one we have planned this weekend.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains a mix of helpful and less helpful information. Some details are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A's interest in hiking and camping, which coincide with the solitary activity of hiking mentioned in the dialogue. The memory mentions Speaker A's application to work at a grocery store, although it incorrectly states it is near a hiking trail (which is not specified in the context). Speaker A being a recent high school graduate and on a cross-country job search is extraneous to the current conversation. Similarly, Speaker B's personality traits and their enjoyment of camping and hiking are somewhat related, given the conversation about a career in the park system. Details like A and B planning to hike this weekend do not add to the immediate context but align with their shared interests. While the memory includes some relevant connections, it lacks a clear structure of past interactions and includes unnecessary details not directly beneficial to generating the next response."
