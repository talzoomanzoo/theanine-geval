Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n2. Speaker B has been getting all A's in the sports medicine class.\n3. Speaker B is on their way to college and studying sports medicine.\n4. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n5. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n6. Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It reveals that Speaker B is taking an exam in sports medicine, which directly relates to Speaker A's question about the exam. The MEMORY also provides context about Speaker B's academic performance and the pressure they feel to maintain good grades, which could inform Speaker B's response about their feelings or the outcomes of the exam. Additionally, the MEMORY includes information about Speaker A's academic struggles, which while not directly relevant to the current context, is phrased in a way that a language model can recognize as background information. Overall, the MEMORY clearly demonstrates past interactions and connections that are helpful in generating an appropriate next response, with a slightly lesser focus on Speaker A, which is why it doesn't score a 5."
