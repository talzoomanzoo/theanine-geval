Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer? Speaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys going to museums and trying different foods.\n2. Speaker A is interested in music concerts and planning a trip to Sao Paulo.\n3. Speaker B is waiting for bands to announce their summer tour schedule to plan which shows to attend.\n4. Speaker A is planning to visit the Museum of Art of São Paulo next week with their boyfriend.\n5. Speaker B recommends visiting the Museum of Art of São Paulo in the city.\n6. Speaker B enjoys living in the city for the accessibility to food and live music.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides useful context for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, memories 1, 2, and 4 are relevant because they relate to Speaker A's interest in museums, which connects to the current dialogue where Speaker A asks about what sort of art museum is being referred to. Memory 4 directly mentions Speaker A's plans to visit a museum, complementing the dialogue context smoothly. While memories 3, 5, and 6 do not directly impact the current dialogue about the museum, they are still phrased in a way that provides background information about the speakers' interests and lifestyles, which could help in future interactions. There is a natural flow, but the relevance is mostly on Speaker A, with some indirect benefit regarding Speaker B's interests (e.g., music concerts and city life). Overall, the MEMORY structured in a way that largely supports understanding the interaction and aiding in the continuation of the dialogue."
