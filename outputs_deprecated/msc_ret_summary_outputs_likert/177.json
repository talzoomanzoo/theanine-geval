    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you? Speaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses. Speaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set? Speaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\n2. Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them.\n3. Speaker B's father was involved in producing horror movies, which influenced Speaker B's favorite genre.\n4. Speaker A also likes mid-century design and is a fan of horror movies.\n5. Speaker A prefers classic horror movies like Halloween or Friday the 13th over modern ones.\n6. Speaker B has a government job that pays the bills but wishes they could work in interior design.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a crazy and intense moment on set! It's amazing how dedicated and focused everyone must be to create those realistic horror scenes. It must have been quite the sight to see!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that helps to understand the context of the conversation. It confirms Speaker B's involvement in horror movies (#1, #3) and mentions their enjoyment and creative conversations regarding developing plot ideas, which aligns with their enjoyment stated in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It also points out Speaker B's influence from their father, providing some depth to their interest in horror movies. However, MEMORY has some inaccuracies and unrelated information. The claim that Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies (#2) is incorrect as it was Speaker A who asked about the process out of curiosity, not a stated passion. Meanwhile, Speaker A's interest in mid-century design (#4) and preference for classic horror movies (#5) do not align with the conversation, making these points less useful to the current dialogue. Lastly, the information about Speaker B's government job (#6) is somewhat relevant as it contrasts with their interest in creative work, but the specific mention of wishing to work in interior design is not really helping the current conversation, as Speaker B already mentioned they are not sure about interior design being a good fit. Overall, the MEMORY provides some helpful background but contains inaccuracies and irrelevant details, leading to a moderate score."
