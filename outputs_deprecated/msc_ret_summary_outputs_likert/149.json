Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself! Speaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food? Speaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too? Speaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also? Speaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways? Speaker B: They've been better as I left my previous job so I'm spending more time with them, how do you manage to work full time and still keep those animals happy? Speaker A: I think working at the zoo so long has helped. Why did you leave your last job. Was that the one you were working in the warehouse? Sorry to hear about your dogs, it can be hard managing older animals. Speaker B: Yea, that totally makes sense! I just wanted time off to spend with the dogs and look for a better job elsewhere, I'm hoping that I'll be able to get a job outside of a warehouse! Speaker A: That is understandable. I didn't always think I would end up a zookeeper. Do you have anything in mind?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has penguins at the zoo and enjoys working with animals, offering Speaker B a chance to help out.\n2. Speaker A works at a zoo and is willing to help Speaker B get an entry-level position there.\n3. Speaker B is looking for a new job and is excited about the opportunity at the zoo.\n4. Speaker A mentions that entry-level positions at the zoo involve cleaning enclosures and feeding less dangerous animals but offer decent pay, training, benefits, and assistance with schooling.\n5. Speaker B has elderly terriers and is planning to leave their part-time job for a break before starting a new one.\n6. Speaker A works at a zoo and has tried playing music for the white tigers and home concerts for their pets.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "I'm thinking about applying for an entry-level position at the zoo you mentioned. It sounds like a great opportunity!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The memory provides several relevant details that align with the dialogue context, making it helpful for generating the next response. Specifically, it mentions Speaker B's interest in finding a new job, which connects to Speaker A's job at the zoo, a topic present in the dialogue. The memory also includes information about Speaker B's elderly terriers and their intention to leave a part-time job, relevant to discussions about spending more time with pets. Though the details about Speaker A playing music for tigers and offering entry-level positions at the zoo are not directly referenced in the dialogue, they contribute to understanding Speaker A's character and potential avenues for the conversation to take, such as discussing more about the zoo or employment opportunities. A higher score would require an even stronger direct connection or causality to the immediate dialogue context, but overall, the memory is well-structured and provides useful context."
