Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing? Speaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from? Speaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there. Speaker B: That's great. I have gotten my pets from the shelter and they seem happy I brought them home. I have a hard time saying no to them which is why I have so many pets. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs. Do you have a name in mind for your cat?  Speaker A: I've thought of a lot of  names, but in the end it will probably depend on the breed and the sex.   Speaker B: That's true. Is pilates hard? I've always wanted to try it but I don't know if it will be too difficult. Speaker A: No, I don't think it's hard.  I actually enjoy it.  It's more fun than work, at least to me. You should give it a try! Speaker B: Maybe I will. Do you think I can start at home by watching Youtube videos, or do I need to go to a Pilates class?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions.\n2. Both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy the company of their pets and think they are smart and playful.\n3. Speaker A is considering getting kittens and thinks rats can be smart.\n4. Speaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals, discovered love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets.\n5. Speaker A reads a novel a week, lives in the city, and goes to pilates class.\n6. Speaker B is in college, paints on the side, and has five dogs and three rats.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Both options could work, but I think going to a class with an instructor might be better for proper form and guidance. Plus, it's always nice to have a group setting for motivation and support.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful context for understanding Speaker A and Speaker B's interests and background, which aids in generating a relevant response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, MEMORY point 3 aligns with the conversation about pets, especially Speaker A's interest in kittens. MEMORY point 4 highlights Speaker B's painting hobby, which is relevant to their discussion about painting portraits. Additionally, point 5 mentions Speaker A's pilates classes, tying into their conversation about whether pilates is hard. However, some points, like point 1 about Persian cats and the enjoyment of pets in point 2, do not directly provide information needed for generating an immediate response in the ongoing dialogue. While the MEMORY is well-structured, not all items clearly contribute to the continuation of the current conversation, resulting in a mid-range score."
