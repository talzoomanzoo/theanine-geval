Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden. Speaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways? Speaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there? Speaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot.  Speaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden? Speaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends. Speaker A: That sounds nice! So how is your job going? Speaker B: Always interesting, that's for sure! I have been training to nurse on a new floor, so that'll give me a change of scenery.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discussed the differences between Sweden and the US, including coffee breaks.\n4. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n5. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n6. Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some helpful information but is not entirely aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically:\n\n1. Sentence 1 states that Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together. This does not align with the context of the conversation where Speaker A is planning the trip, and Speaker B doesn't have plans to visit soon.\n   \n2. Sentence 2 mentions Speaker A's need to save money for a trip, which is relevant to travel but not directly linked to the ongoing dialogue.\n\n3. Sentence 3 discusses a past conversation about differences between Sweden and the US, which might help in generating responses around cross-cultural topics, but isn't directly pertinent here.\n\n4. Sentences 4 and 5 provide relevant context about Speaker A having a cousin in Sweden and Speaker B's connection to the country, which can aid in understanding their conversation dynamics.\n\n5. Sentence 6 talks about Speaker B not visiting Sweden due to high expenses, which is somewhat relevant given the context of Speaker B's fondness for Sweden.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY contains some useful information but is mixed with irrelevant details. Proper alignment and logical flow could improve clarity for generating responses."
