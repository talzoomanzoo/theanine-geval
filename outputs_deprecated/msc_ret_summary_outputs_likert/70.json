Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it! Speaker B: I'm glad you liked it. My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to? Speaker A: I recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca. It was super cute and made me want to go visit Italy, but that was too expensive, so instead I booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month. What about you? Speaker B: I have been relaxing with the kids as much as I have. My husband has been busy with work, so we haven't had time for anything big. I would love to visit Italy some day though if we get the chance. Have you ever been to Italy before? Speaker A: I have never gone to Italy because I'm always so busy. If I ever go, I would want to spend a month there, but work has been hectic lately. Would your kids go with you if you went to Italy?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has seen the Disney movie 'Luca' recently.\n2. Speaker B's kids enjoyed watching 'Luca' and said it was good.\n3. Speaker B enjoys watching movies with her kids.\n4. Speaker B's kids enjoy watching Disney movies, which Speaker B also finds good.\n5. Speaker A has booked a \"Hawaii Sunset\" tour for next month, being excited about it being their first time.\n6. Speaker A works two jobs and struggles to make time for themselves, but still manages to plan a trip to Hawaii.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm sure my kids would love to visit Italy with us. They enjoy exploring new places just as much as I do. But for now, I think they're just excited about our upcoming movie nights and your Hawaii sunset tour sounds amazing! Have a great time on your trip!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information for Speaker B to generate a proper next response. It mentions that Speaker A recently watched the Disney movie 'Luca' (Memory 1), which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A mentions watching 'Luca'. Memory 5 and 6 give additional context about Speaker A's current situation, such as booking a Hawaii tour and having a busy work schedule, respectively. While some elements in MEMORY 2, 3, and 4 provide insight into Speaker B's family movie preferences, they are slightly less relevant to the immediate dialogue context but still naturally phrased. Overall, the MEMORY maintains a natural flow and provides enough context from past interactions to aid in understanding the current conversation."
