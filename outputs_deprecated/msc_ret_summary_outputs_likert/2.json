Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet? Speaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there? Speaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n2. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n3. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\n4. Speaker B received a new car from their mom and plans to drive during spring break.\n5. Speaker A is worried about gas mileage and asks about the fuel efficiency of Speaker B's car.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does contain some relevant information that can be helpful in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, point 1 about Speaker B going on a trip is directly relevant, as Speaker B mentions traveling to Costa Rica in the dialogue. Additionally, point 2 provides context about past interactions regarding travel preferences, and point 3 expresses Speaker B's excitement about upcoming events, which might be relevant if the conversation shifts towards future plans.\n\nHowever, some sentences (e.g., points 4 and 5 regarding the car and fuel efficiency) are less relevant to the immediate context of traveling to Costa Rica, especially since the dialogue focuses on plane tickets and the destination itself. Nonetheless, they are correctly structured and can easily be identified as not beneficial by the language model.\n\nOverall, while the MEMORY includes some helpful information and context related to Speaker B's trip, there are also details that might not immediately add value to generating the next response in the given context."
