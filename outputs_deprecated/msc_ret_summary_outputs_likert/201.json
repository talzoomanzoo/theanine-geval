Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her? Speaker B: Hi there, hope you are wlll and managing to save up for your Italy trip?  Thank for asking about the Greek mythology study, we are doing very well. It helps because i am so passionate about it and hope to get to the Greek islands soon Speaker A: Yes I have been saving up for another trip to Italy! I can't wait. It's planned for next Spring. Do you have any plans to go back to Italy in the future? Speaker B: I would love to get back to Italy but need to save up and the hopeful priority is to Greece this year.  You have friends in Europe are you in contact to see what plans you can make? Speaker A: Yes I've been talking to them quite a bit so they know what's going on. I'll be staying with some of them while I'm over there. I have never been to Greece....I'd like to go though. Maybe I'll add it to my itinerary! Maybe we could plan to be in Greece at the same time?! Speaker B: That would be so good.  There is so much history and the roman statues i take my daughter to see in the museums and through our local resources is fab.  She is building up the passion which is lovely to see.  Have you still got your hair blue or has it grown out now?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology.\n2. Speaker A is fascinated by the architecture of Italy and enjoys studying history, especially through reading and watching documentaries.\n3. Speaker A is planning to travel to Italy alone for Spring Break and has friends from Europe meeting up with them.\n4. Speaker B has been to Italy in the past and enjoyed the food there.\n5.

    "raw_prediction": "I actually dyed my hair back to its natural color a few weeks ago. I figured it was time for a change. But I'm glad to hear your daughter is getting more interested in Greek mythology. It's such a fascinating subject to explore together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several pieces of relevant information that could be helpful for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 1, for instance, captures Speaker B's interest in visiting Greece, which aligns with the current topic of discussion about traveling to Greece. Sentence 3 mentions Speaker A's plans for a trip to Italy, which is also relevant as it is directly mentioned in the dialogue. Sentence 5 ties into Speaker B's passion for Greek mythology, an ongoing theme in the conversation. \n\nThe MEMORY is structured in a way that highlights the interests and past experiences of both speakers concerning travel and Greek mythology, aiding in understanding the context of their conversation. However, Sentence 6, while accurate, doesn't directly inform the DIALOGUE CONTEXT around Greece or Italy, slightly lowering its relevance. Overall, the MEMORY is helpful in providing contextual cues but could be improved by ensuring that each sentence is directly applicable to the current context of the dialogue."
