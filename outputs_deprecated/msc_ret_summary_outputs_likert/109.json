Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college? Speaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys playing soccer but is not into music.\n2. Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n3. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.\n4. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n5. Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n6. Speaker A is a college student majoring in Humanities, not currently employed but used to work part-time at a supermarket.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I play as a striker for my team. It's definitely more exciting being up front and scoring goals. Speaking of which, I've been scoring pretty well lately, looking forward to our match next week.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly the information about both Speaker A and Speaker B's involvement in soccer. Sentences 1, 2, 3, and 5 are relevant because they highlight Speaker A's passion and active participation in soccer, which is pertinent given the context. Sentence 4 provides context about Speaker B's practice of playing soccer in college, which aligns with the dialogue. Sentences 1 and 2, although somewhat related, help offer additional context about Speaker A, even though their relevance to direct dialogue generation is moderate. Sentence 6, however, lacks direct relevance to the soccer-focused dialogue but provides background context on Speaker A's current life details. Overall, while the MEMORY captures some aspects of the dialogue context, it does not provide a strongly clear or causal development of past interactions related directly to the current context but is still decently structured for supporting response generation."
