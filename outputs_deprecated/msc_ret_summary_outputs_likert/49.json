Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job. Speaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career. Speaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday. Speaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud. Speaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach? Speaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\n3. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n4. Speaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\n5. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n6. Speaker A is studying computer science and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great that you have multiple interests to consider! You could always find a way to incorporate both English and history into your teaching. It's all about finding what you're passionate about.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information in providing context to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, the context mentions Speaker A's interest in teaching robotics, and the MEMORY supports this with information about Speaker A studying computer science and wanting to teach robotics (sentence 1). This connection is relevant and naturally phrased. Sentence 4 also aligns with the context's mention of Speaker A studying computer science, though it adds the detail of Speaker A working at a pizza shop which isn't directly relevant to the conversation at hand. Information about Speaker B's career considerations in linguistics (sentences 2 and 5) aligns somewhat with the context, where Speaker B discusses career options and interests in English and history teaching.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY includes some information that isn't directly relevant to the current dialogue. For instance, Speaker Aâ€™s desire to develop apps for differently abled youth (sentence 6) and Speaker B's thoughts on pursuing a master's degree and college professorship (sentence 3) are interesting but not directly applicable to the conversation's immediate flow or topic.\n\nTherefore, while there is some relevant and naturally connected information, not all MEMORY sentences strongly support the ongoing dialogue, justifying a middle-ground score."
