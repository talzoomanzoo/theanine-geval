Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet? Speaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there? Speaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay? Speaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately? Speaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"' Speaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history. Speaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n2. Speaker B has an oldest nephew who is about to turn 14.\n3. Speaker B asks if the recommended book is fiction or nonfiction.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation.\n5. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n6. Both Speaker A's mother and Speaker A were librarians, but Speaker A is retired.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "He's doing great, thanks for asking! He's about to turn 14, can you believe it? Time really does fly. I need to start planning his birthday party soon. By the way, I haven't started packing yet for my trip. I should probably get on that soon, lol.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information that can be helpful for generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. First, it mentions Speaker B's plans for an adventurous spring break (MEMORY 1), which relates to their upcoming trip to Costa Rica, demonstrating a contrast to Speaker A's past spring break experiences. Additionally, MEMORY 5 highlights that Speaker B hasn't started packing yet, which could be a relevant point to bring up in further conversation about their trip. MEMORY 6 provides background information about Speaker A's and their mother's former careers as librarians, which is somewhat related to Speaker A's interest in books, potentially providing context for future discussions about literature. \n\nWhile MEMORY 2's information about Speaker B's nephew's age fits with the final question in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, other items like MEMORY 3 and MEMORY 4 seem less immediately relevant. MEMORY 3 discusses a book inquiry but doesn't align with any part of the current context, and MEMORY 4, concerning their mutual sense of humor, isn't directly relevant to crafting the next response in this context. Nonetheless, the overall coherence and relevance of the provided memories warrant a score of 4, as they collectively aid in understanding the context and crafting a relevant and informed continuation of the dialogue."
