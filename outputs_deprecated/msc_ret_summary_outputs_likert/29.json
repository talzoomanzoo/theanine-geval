Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok?  Speaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish? Speaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus! Speaker B: Oh that sounds absolutely fabulous. Are you going to get a free dessert, as well? Speaker A: Yes, I am thinking about trying either the new eclairs, or their tres leches cake with fresh raspberry jam sauce and lemon drizzle! I have too many good options to pick from! What one would you pick? Speaker B: Hands down, I would pick the tres leches. Ever since I tried it a few years ago, it has always been my favorite dessert. Speaker A: Okay, I will try that! I've heard the can be made with different fruits. Did you have fruit with yours? Speaker B: I like it best with fresh strawberries. And then it is even better with some fresh whipped cream and chocolate drizzle. Just thinking about it is making me want to have some right now!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n2. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n3. Speaker B loves the beach and Mediterranean food.\n4. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n5. Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule.\n6. Speaker A's restaurant plays a mix of songs, mainly easy listening, to create a relaxing environment for diners.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds absolutely delicious! I'll definitely have to try it with fresh strawberries and all those extra toppings. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information that is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It notes that Speaker A works at a restaurant, which aligns with the context that Speaker A is excited about trying a new dish added to their workplace menu. However, this detail is repeated in various forms, making it somewhat redundant. Point 3 about Speaker B loving the beach and Mediterranean food is not directly relevant to the current context of the conversation. The other details about Speaker A finding their work busy and enjoying the restaurant's environment are not directly connected to the discussion about food choices. Overall, although the MEMORY has some relevant points, it could be more concise and focused directly on the dialogue context to provide a higher level of helpfulness. Additionally, the information included doesn't convey a clear development or causality relating to the specific conversation at hand, thus earning a middle-range score."
