Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam? Speaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A. Speaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now? Speaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done.  Speaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on? Speaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study? Speaker B: Ah, English should be easier than History. Sure, I can help you. What do you need to do exactly? Write an essay? Speaker A: Yeah, we have to write an essay and we have a spelling component towards the end of the exam, I sure could use a little help! Speaker B: No problem! I like correcting and editing essays. Although, it seems like your English is pretty good. I doubt you even need much help. Speaker A: Excellent, thank you for taking the time to help me out a little. I would like to get an A!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A wishes to get better grades and is hopeful for a soccer scholarship.\n2. Speaker B has been getting all A's in the sports medicine class.\n3. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n4. Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring.\n5. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n6. Both speakers value good grades and believe it can lead to better job opportunities.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Of course, I'm happy to help! Getting an A in English will definitely boost your overall grade. Let's make sure you're fully prepared for that final exam.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains several relevant pieces of information which could be helpful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, point 4 about Speaker A struggling with history class is directly related to the discussion in the context where Speaker A mentions not having the best History teacher. Additionally, point 6 highlights that both speakers value good grades, which reflects the dialogue's emphasis on academic performance. \n\nHowever, some points in the MEMORY, like Speaker B's performance in sports medicine (point 2) and training in that subject (point 5), are unrelated to the current conversation mainly focused on history, English, and essay writing help. While these points are not relevant to the specific interaction, they are still presented in well-structured and naturally phrased sentences, making it easier for a language model to discern their relevance or lack thereof. \n\nOverall, MEMORY provides partially helpful context, which is why it receives a middle score. Adjustments or more tailored memories focusing on current conversational topics would help improve its helpfulness further."
