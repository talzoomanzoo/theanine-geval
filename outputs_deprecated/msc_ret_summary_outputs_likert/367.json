Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job! Speaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist, mentioning the ups and downs of the profession.\n2. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n3. Speaker A works at a stable and enjoys being around horses.\n4. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n5. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n6. Speaker B offers to talk about the absence of Speaker A's mother and suggests lying down on their couch.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, it can definitely be challenging at times, but overall, I find it very rewarding. It's fulfilling to see people grow and overcome their struggles.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information that helps a language model generate a suitable response based on the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. In particular, sentences 1 and 5 directly relate to Speaker B's profession as a therapist, which is the focus of the conversation. Sentence 1 mentions their career's ups and downs, which is particularly pertinent since Speaker A inquires whether Speaker B still enjoys being a therapist. Sentence 5 provides context about the duration of Speaker B's experience, which could inform Speaker B's response about enjoyment and career satisfaction.\n\nOn the other hand, sentences 2, 3, 4, and 6, while naturally phrased, contain information that is either unrelated or less directly connected to the current dialogue context. Sentence 2 mentions Speaker B's support for a football team, sentence 3 discusses Speaker A's job unrelatedly, and sentence 4 introduces an academic facet about horses that doesn't directly respond to the context. Sentence 6 introduces a therapeutic offer to Speaker A regarding their mother, which although thematically related to therapy, may not help the immediate dialogue regarding the current question of enjoyment of being a therapist.\n\nOverall, while the MEMORY contains helpful and relevant sentences that align with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, it also includes extraneous information, limiting its score to 3."
