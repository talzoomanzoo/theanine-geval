Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens? Speaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend.\n2. Speaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo.\n3. Speaker A prefers cockatoos over kittens as pets.\n4. Speaker B's girlfriend enjoys pandas and penguins at the zoo, and they go to the zoo every few weeks.\n5. Speaker A is focused on saving money and not planning to have children in the near future.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss hobbies and interests, with Speaker A enjoying gardening and reading, and Speaker B enjoying visiting the zoo.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a good plan. It's important to make sure you have enough time to properly care for the new kitten.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information in sentence 1, which directly relates to Speaker B's consideration of adopting a kitten from a friend. However, it does not mention the vacation plans which could be a critical factor affecting the adoption timing, making the connection to DIALOGUE CONTEXT incomplete. The other sentences (2-6) mention various interests and hobbies, but they do not contribute to the context of deciding whether or not to adopt the kitten or addressing the timing for doing so due to the vacation. Most of the content in the MEMORY is more about other unrelated interests and not very useful for generating a helpful response to the conversation about adopting a kitten. The overall structure does not clearly demonstrate the development of interactions relevant to the immediate concern in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
