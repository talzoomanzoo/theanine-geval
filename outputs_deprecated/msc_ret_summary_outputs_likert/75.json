    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it! Speaker B: I'm glad you liked it. My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to? Speaker A: I recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca. It was super cute and made me want to go visit Italy, but that was too expensive, so instead I booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month. What about you? Speaker B: I have been relaxing with the kids as much as I have. My husband has been busy with work, so we haven't had time for anything big. I would love to visit Italy some day though if we get the chance. Have you ever been to Italy before? Speaker A: I have never gone to Italy because I'm always so busy. If I ever go, I would want to spend a month there, but work has been hectic lately. Would your kids go with you if you went to Italy? Speaker B: Absolutely! I'd love to travel all over the world with my family to see everything. Hawaii sounds like just as much fun though. What are you most excited about doing when you get there? Speaker A: I'm extremely excited about the sunset tour. Each day is at a new location to watch the sunset. It's suppose to be romantic, but I am just going alone, so I see it as more calming than anything. Speaker B: I hope you have a lot fun. It sounds like a nice time to get away from everything. You should eat as much of the local Hawaiian food as you can. Have you had Hawaiian food before? I think it's great. Speaker A: No, I acctually haven't. I'm expecting pineapple and ham on everything, but I know they will having some amazing cultural food that is probably going to blow my mind! Is there a specific dish you would recommend Speaker B: I enjoy foods like Spam musubi, loco mocos, and poi. My favorite might be kalua pork. The way they prepare the pig makes it taste so good.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has booked a \"Hawaii Sunset\" tour for next month, being excited about it being their first time.\n2.

Speaker A works two jobs and struggles to make time for themselves, but still manages to plan a trip to Hawaii.\n5. Speaker B's kids enjoy watching Disney movies, which Speaker B also finds good.\n6. Speaker B enjoys watching movies with her kids.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'll definitely keep those dishes in mind and try them out! It sounds like a delicious experience. I can't wait to indulge in some authentic Hawaiian cuisine during my trip.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A booking a \"Hawaii Sunset\" tour, having seen the Disney movie 'Luca', and Speaker B's kids enjoying Disney movies. These details are beneficial for understanding the current conversation. However, there's also some extraneous information, like Speaker A working two jobs and struggling with time (although related, it's not specifically addressed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT), which is not directly useful for generating the next response. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it included more nuanced connections or relevant details from their past interactions that align closely with the ongoing dialogue (e.g., specific memories from watching 'Miracle'). Additionally, while the MEMORY mentions Speaker B's enjoyment of watching movies with her kids, this point isn't specifically discussed in the current dialogue snippet, which limits its direct usefulness. Overall, the MEMORY is adequately structured with relevant details, but lacks some connections and nuanced contextual cues that would enhance its helpfulness."
