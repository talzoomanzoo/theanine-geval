Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play?  Speaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music. Speaker A: ah right, who's your favourite rock band? Speaker B: I'm big fan of aerosmith. When do you learn music. Whom teach you? Speaker A: aerosmith are great, have you ever seen them live? I have been playing drums since i was a kid, my father taught me when I was young and from then on I just taught myself Speaker B: That's awesome! I have been trying to learn last one year. Still I didn't get right teacher. I'm jealous on you. I don't have like your dad.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is in a band and plays music, possibly a musician.\n2. Speaker B is willing to teach Speaker A how to fish and cook.\n3. Speaker A is in a band where they play the drums and write music, with 4 members including the singer who is their best friend.\n4. Speaker A was good at writing in school, while Speaker B was bad at math and preferred fishing.\n5. Speaker A wants to see Sublime live one day but doesn't go to many concerts other than the ones their band plays in.\n6. Speaker A is part of a band that tours different countries for their music.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information that is potentially helpful in generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, item 1 and item 6 relate to Speaker A's involvement in music, which can be relevant given the ongoing discussion about musical interests and experiences. Item 3 also provides useful context by elaborating on Speaker A's role in a band and their bond with the singer, although this specific band detail doesn't directly link back to the current conversation about learning instruments. The connection between Speaker A's musical interests and personal experiences is somewhat established, aiding in contextual relevance.\n\nHowever, several entries, like item 2 (Speaker B teaching fishing and cooking) and item 4 (Speaker A's writing skills and B's math struggles), do not significantly tie back to the immediate dialogue or the theme of music and learning instruments. The structuring of some sentences tries to establish personal backgrounds, but they fail to clearly demonstrate relevance to the present conversation about musical interests, potentially causing the language model to differentiate useful contexts.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY does provide a few relevant details about Speaker A's musical background, which could aid in generating dialogue responses. However, its overall effectiveness is reduced by entries that are either irrelevant or not effectively linked to the dialogue themes."
