Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600.\n2. Speaker A is training for marathons and seeking advice on how to recover.\n3. Speaker B has run a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding.\n4. Speaker B is a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks.\n5. Speaker A is a runner who is working on improving their mile time and training for a marathon.\n6. Speaker B got into motivational speaking because they needed it themselves to battle depression and anxiety.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad you enjoyed the speech! I actually find motivation through running myself. Maybe we can motivate each other on our runs. And I do have some contacts in the motivational speaking world who might be able to help your friend get back on track. Let's chat more about it during our next run!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY is highly helpful for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context involves Speaker A inquiring about Speaker B's motivational speaking and seeking a motivational speaker for a friend to run again. The MEMORY clearly outlines that Speaker B is a motivational speaker who has experience giving pep talks at schools and conferences, which is directly relevant to A's request for a motivational speaker. Additionally, it establishes that Speaker B has a personal connection to running (having run a marathon before) and understands both the challenges and rewards of it, making them an ideal candidate to motivate someone to run. The MEMORY is structured in a coherent manner that highlights the development of their interactions, such as running together and A's training for marathons, as well as B's background in battling personal challenges through motivational speaking, making it easy for a language model to utilize this information effectively."
