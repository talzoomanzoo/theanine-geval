Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend.\n2. Speaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo.\n3. Speaker A prefers cockatoos over kittens as pets.\n4. Speaker B likes poetry and fantasy books, and has a pet cat.\n5. Speaker A has a sister who owns a corgi.\n6. Speaker B's girlfriend has a cockatoo that makes a lot of noise.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains several pieces of information, but not all of them are directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 1 is directly related to the context, as it provides information about Speaker B considering adopting a kitten from a friend, which aligns with the question posed by Speaker A. Sentence 4 partially supports this by stating that Speaker B has a pet cat, indicating a potential interest in adopting another. However, the rest of the sentences (2, 3, 5, and 6) seem less relevant to the current topic, even though they are naturally phrased and provide a picture of the speakers' interests and lives. These sentences might help establish general background knowledge, but they do not contribute directly to answering the question or advancing the kitten adoption discussion. Overall, MEMORY presents some relevant information, but it could be more focused on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT to improve its helpfulness."
