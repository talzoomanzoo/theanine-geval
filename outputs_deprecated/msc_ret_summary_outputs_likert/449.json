Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive. Speaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price? Speaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music Speaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it. Speaker A: I'll keep trying! Have you had any luck lately? Speaker B: No I haven't! I keep hoping that I will so I can buy my dreamhouse but I know the chances are low. Speaker A: Would you move to the city? It'd be too much for me Speaker B: I would love to be able to have a country house and a city house to be able to come and go to each one as I please. doesn't that sound like a dream come true?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both speakers dream of having a city and country house or a summer and winter home.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n4. Speaker B bought 20 lotto tickets with the same numbers, aiming to get a bigger share of the jackpot if they win.\n5. Both speakers acknowledge the pros and cons of city and country living.\n6. Speaker A bought 50 lotto tickets with different numbers to increase their chances of winning.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It really does sound like a dream come true! Having the best of both worlds with a city and country house would be amazing. Who knows, maybe our lotto tickets will come through for us one day.",
    "prediction": "3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information about the speakers' dreams and discussions, but not all details are directly connected to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While sentences 1 and 5 relate to the speakers' conversation about city and country houses, other sentences about lotto strategies (2, 3, 4, 6) provide additional background that is somewhat relevant but not directly necessary for generating a next response in the conversation. The MEMORY is reasonably structured and provides contextual cues, but it includes extra details that are not essential for the immediate context, which may hinder clarity for the language model."
