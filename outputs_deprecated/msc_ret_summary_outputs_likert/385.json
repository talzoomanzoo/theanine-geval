Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it. Speaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it. Speaker A: Cool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot. What is your favorite part about camping? Speaker B: I love being out in the wilderness and sleeping under the stars in the fresh air. It makes you realize how beautiful life is and how small we really are in comparison to the universe. Speaker A: I miss doing that! I have done lots of picnics with my family but it's been a long time since I've slept in a tent! Looking forward to it again when the kids are older. Where was the last place you went? Speaker B: We went up to an island in the middle of nowhere in Canada. There were lots of bears and huge moose! Speaker A: Wow, that sounds like such an adventure! I love to visit Canada. I have seen moose but never a bear! That must have been scary! Speaker B: Yes, it is quite scary. We could also hear the wolves howling at night, luckily we didn't come across them though. One thing to note about bears, is they just want to come and scrounge for our food, so we learned to safely pack it away and hang it up high in a tree. Speaker A: Yes, I've heard that it's important to be careful in bear country! I would love to see one in person though. Do you take lots of photos on your trips? Speaker B: Yes, I took quite a few. The scenery was stunning. Would you like me to send you some photos? I know they are uninteresting to some people.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat.\n2. Speaker B is busy with scouts, school, work, and tennis, but willing to take vacation days for the retreat.\n3. Speaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout.\n4. Speaker A suggested that Speaker B join one of the church retreats in the future.\n5. Speaker A is involved in church activities and mentioned a church retreat\n6. Speaker B plans to earn the Eagle Scout badge for college applications.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I would love to see some photos from your trip! I bet the scenery was absolutely breathtaking. Thank you for offering to share them with me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some background on Speaker B's extensive involvement in scouting, which is pertinent to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B discusses their camping experiences and survival skills related to Boy Scouts. This information helps to establish Speaker B's credibility as someone with significant experience in scouting and survival skills. However, much of the MEMORY is focused on Speaker B's commitments and plans related to church retreats and college applications, which are not directly relevant to the ongoing dialogue about camping and encounters with wildlife. While these pieces of information are naturally phrased and provide some context about Speaker B's life, they do not directly aid in crafting a response to the immediate conversational context regarding camping and survival skills. Therefore, the MEMORY is moderately helpful in the context of generating the next response in the dialogue."
