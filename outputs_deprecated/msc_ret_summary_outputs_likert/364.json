Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing? Speaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha! Speaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes? Speaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe.  Speaker A: You make them sounds so fascinating. Will you take them with you to your college dorm?  Speaker B: I'll be living off campus, so absolutely. How about you? Are you staying in the dorms? Speaker A: I'm glad your taking them with you. My mum wants me to stay in dorms. But I think I just want my own place, less drama and more freedom that way. Speaker B: Yup. My parents wanted me to do the same thing...for \"that experience\". To be honest, I don't want it. It'd just be a distraction! \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel.\n2. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n3. Speaker B is excited about taking neuroscience classes next year.\n4. Speaker A does not have any pets and expresses an interest in scuba diving.\n5. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans.\n6. Speaker B is a veteran who went to the army after high school, interested in neuroscience and seeking advice on studying it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information that is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but could be structured in a more coherent way to clearly and directly support generating the next response. Memory 1 directly relates to the context, reaffirming Speaker B's affinity with reptiles. Memory 6 provides insight on Speaker B's background and interests, which could indirectly influence the conversation. However, the other memories, such as Speaker A's lab volunteering and interest in scuba diving, or Speaker B being a veteran, while potentially useful for broader context, do not directly relate to the current dialogue about living situations and personal preferences regarding pets. These memories are not irrelevant, but their relevance is more peripheral, and they lack the direct connection needed to optimally inform the next response in the given context. The sentence structures, although separate, remain clear, enabling identification of key elements, yet they don't sufficiently intertwine to deliver maximum contextual cueing for the next response, justifying a mid-range score."
