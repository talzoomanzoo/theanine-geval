Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n2. Speaker B is looking forward to eating a pizza burger in a pool with punk music playing.\n3. Speaker B enjoys cruising in their car while listening to punk music.\n4. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n5. Speaker A finds swimming relaxing and uses it to destress from their job.\n6. Speaker A has planned to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be useful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's enjoyment of punk music and their desire to listen to it while swimming and programming (Memory 1 and 2). These pieces of information support Speaker A's mention of the playlist crafted for the meetup. However, other memories, such as cruising in a car (Memory 3) and engaging in activities at a cruise destination (Memory 6), while naturally phrased, do not directly relate to the context of the meetup or provide helpful cues for constructing the next response in this particular dialogue scenario. Therefore, the memories provide limited helpfulness in progressing the dialogue, warranting a score of 3."
