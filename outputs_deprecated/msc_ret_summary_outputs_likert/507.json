Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play?  Speaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music.

Speaker A: That's a shame, I'm sure you could find a club to surf with at a local beach. Have you been out fishing recently?\n\nMEMORY:\n1.

Speaker B loves fishing and spending time near the ocean, but doesn't have time to surf anymore due to working at a doctor's office.\n4. Speaker A enjoys surfing and music as a way to escape from daily life.\n5. Speaker A grew up on the beach and is good at surfing, nicknamed \"lil fishie\".\n6.

    "raw_prediction": "No, I haven't been fishing lately. I miss being out on the water, it's so relaxing. I wish I had more time for both surfing and fishing.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant context that could be helpful for generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, point 1 establishes that Speaker B is interested in surfing, which ties into the ongoing conversation about surfing. Point 2 also relates to Speaker B's desire to learn surfing, although this wasn't directly mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, it aligns with their expression of interest. \n\nHowever, points like 3, 5, and 6 are less directly relevant. While point 3 provides background information, it doesn't directly connect to the dialogue, as Speaker B's current job or lack of time hasn't been directly referenced in this exchange. Point 5 about Speaker A's nickname and upbringing is interesting but does not currently connect to the dialogue provided. Lastly, point 6 about fishing and cooking seems unrelated to the current conversation, despite fishing being mentioned, there is no direct thread about teaching fishing or cooking in the context.\n\nOverall, while some parts of the MEMORY contribute useful context, many elements don't contribute directly to generating the next dialogue line, reducing the overall score."
