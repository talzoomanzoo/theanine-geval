Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens? Speaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month Speaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.  Where are you going on vacation? Speaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there! Speaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo? Speaker B: Their zoo is pretty good! It's always crowded, of course, but they have pandas so I'm happy. I would say it's bigger than the DC zoo, but I like that the DC zoo has fewer people. Speaker A: That sounds awesome.  I haven't been to the zoo in so long.  I wish I could go. Speaker B: You should go with your sister! she can bring her dog. They probably have all kinds of exotic birds... Speaker A: That's a great idea!  I'm not sure how good her dog would do around other animals though.  She always barks like crazy whenever she sees any kind of animal.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys seeing pandas and penguins at the zoo and goes with their sister.\n2. Speaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo.\n3. Speaker B's girlfriend enjoys pandas and penguins at the zoo, and they go to the zoo every few weeks.\n4. Speaker A has been to the zoo before and enjoys seeing exotic birds.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss hobbies and interests, with Speaker A enjoying gardening and reading, and Speaker B enjoying visiting the zoo.\n6. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is not entirely cohesive nor especially informative for generating a proper next response. Here is the breakdown:\n\n1. Sentence 6 is relevant as it directly aligns with the initial part of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend, which is a key topic in the conversation.\n\n2. Sentence 2 is somewhat relevant as it mentions Speaker B has a cat, but this information is slightly confusing since in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, Speaker B is thinking about adopting a kitten, making it unclear whether they already have a cat.\n\n3. Sentence 5 offers some context about Speaker B's interests, particularly the zoo, which is relevant to the part of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about their upcoming zoo visit.\n\nThe other sentences seem less helpful as they either don't align with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT or introduce information about Speaker A that was not discussed, such as their gardening and reading hobbies (Sentence 5) and enjoyment of seeing pandas and penguins in Sentence 1 and Sentence 4. \n\nOverall, the MEMORY could benefit from clearer development of events and more directly relevant information in relation to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT while ensuring no inconsistencies or additional characters are introduced."
