Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it! Thank you for the recommendation.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in watching movies, mentioned Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman.\n2. Speaker B is knowledgeable about movies and provides recommendations based on Speaker A's preferences.\n3. Speaker A relies on Speaker B for movie suggestions, mentioning a preference for comedies.\n4. Speaker B enjoys watching suspense films, action, SF, horror, westerns, drama, and occasional good comedy.\n5. Speaker B used to teach Film Studies and carefully chooses what movies to watch.\n6. Speaker A enjoyed the movie \"Coming to America\" and expressed interest in watching its sequel.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad you enjoyed Pulp Fiction! If you liked that, you might also enjoy other Quentin Tarantino films like Reservoir Dogs or Kill Bill. Let me know if you want more recommendations in that style.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY is quite helpful in providing contextual cues for the language model to generate a proper response. It clearly outlines the interests and preferences of both speakers regarding movies. For example, it mentions that Speaker A is interested in movies and relies on Speaker B for recommendations, which connects well with the context where Speaker A thanks Speaker B for recommending \"Pulp Fiction.\" Additionally, it highlights Speaker B's background and expertise in films, indicating why their recommendations might be reliable and valued by Speaker A. Although not all sentences directly relate to the current context, they are phrased naturally and present a coherent picture of past interactions, making it easier for the language model to grasp the dynamics between the speakers. This level of detail supports a nuanced response from Speaker B."
