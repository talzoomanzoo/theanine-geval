Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam? Speaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A. Speaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now? Speaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has been getting all A's in the sports medicine class.\n2. Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring.\n3. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n4. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n5. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n6. Speaker A wishes to get better grades and is hopeful for a soccer scholarship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it informs us that Speaker B has been getting all A's in sports medicine (1, 3) and feels pressured to maintain those grades (5), which could potentially influence Speaker B's perspective or response in the dialogue about exams. Additionally, the fact that Speaker A struggles with history (2, 4) is directly relevant to the conversation where Speaker A mentioned their history exam. However, the MEMORY also contains information that is not directly relevant to the current dialogue topic, such as Speaker B's sports medicine class (6) and Speaker A's hope for a soccer scholarship (6). The sentences are somewhat naturally connected, but the MEMORY could be structured better to provide a clearer development or causality related to current dialogue context."
