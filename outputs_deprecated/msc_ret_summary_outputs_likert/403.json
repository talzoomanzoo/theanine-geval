Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue. Speaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad. Speaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs! Speaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours? Speaker A: Ikea! Their furniture is not to expensive and they have all kinds of furniture that'll go with whatever scheme you're going for. What kind of patio furniture were you looking for? Like a barbeque, chairs, hammock?  Speaker B: I guess I was going to get like an umbrella table and some chairs to go with it or maybe even a screened in gazebo with a fire pit in the middle.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing furniture and home decor choices.\n2. Speaker A recently bought new furniture for their house, including a couch, recliner, and patio furniture.\n3. Speaker A is looking to redecorate their house and likes purple furniture.\n4. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to meet up to discuss the furniture exchange.\n6. Speaker A is looking forward to spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a cozy setup! A screened-in gazebo with a fire pit sounds perfect for those summer nights. You'll have to show me once you get it all set up.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, albeit with certain limitations. \n\n1. It accurately reflects the discussion about furniture, which is consistent with the current dialogue context where Speaker A and B are discussing patio furniture and color schemes.\n2. The mention of Speaker A having recently bought new furniture aligns with the conversation about furniture sourcing and preferences. However, MEMORY incorrectly suggests Speaker A likes purple furniture, which does not match the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A suggests white with blue or red.\n3. The reference to enjoying music, food, and company is somewhat related to the barbecue plan, yet the MEMORY does not explicitly connect it to the specific context of the barbecue that Speaker A and B are planning.\n4. The MEMORY does mention a meet-up to discuss furniture, which is contextually aligned, but it could be more specific to the type of furniture being discussed in the context, such as the umbrella table and chairs.\n5. The intention to spend evenings outside aligns with the brief discussion of outdoor plans, though it doesnâ€™t directly address the mosquito issue mentioned by Speaker B.\n\nOverall, while there are elements in the MEMORY that resonate with the ongoing dialogue context, they could be phrased more straightforwardly to make the connection and relevance more explicit, leading to a mid-range helpfulness score."
