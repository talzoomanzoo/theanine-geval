Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist, mentioning the ups and downs of the profession.\n2. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n3. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n4. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n5. Speaker B is a professional in a practice, where it is illegal for them to have relationships with clients.\n6. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Well, it was a combination of my passion for helping others and my interest in understanding the complexities of the human mind. It's definitely been a fulfilling journey so far, despite the challenges that come with the profession.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provided offers several relevant pieces of information that can assist a language model in generating a proper next response for the provided DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It identifies Speaker B as a therapist, elucidates on their professional experience, and provides insights into relevant topics of discussion between Speaker A and B (e.g., horse psychology and legality of relationships with clients). These elements can lead A to understand B's professional stance and potentially redirect the conversation. However, details such as Speaker B's affinity for football and their favored team may offer little connection to the ongoing dialogue, which slightly reduces the continuity of the MEMORY to DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
