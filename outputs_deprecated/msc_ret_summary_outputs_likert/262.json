    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume. Speaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment.  Speaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon? Speaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think? Speaker A: It depends on what you are trying to make out of origami, you can make some super complicated stuff, there's actually special paper that you can get for it! You may have seen origami be used in the hospital for some breathing aperatus!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully.\n2. Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n3. Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks.\n4. Speaker A volunteers at a hospital and enjoys making origami crafts, specifically a 3D modular swan with glue.\n5. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next.\n6. Speaker B is interested in making origami animals and finds the idea cute.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's fascinating! I had no idea origami could be used in the hospital like that. It sounds like there's so much more to it than just folding paper. I'm really looking forward to learning from you and seeing what we can create together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, points 1 and 2 indicate Speaker A's experience and self-learning with origami, which aligns with their interest and accomplishment mentioned in the context. Points 3 and 4 support the DIALOGUE CONTEXT by showing that Speaker A has offered to teach Speaker B origami, establishing a connection to Speaker B's interest in learning it. However, certain elements like points 5 and 6 diverge into specific crafting plans and interests that, while related to origami, do not directly connect with the current dialogue or aid in constructing a relevant response. The MEMORY offers a snapshot of past interactions but lacks a clear development or cause-effect narrative that could better support generating future responses. Thus, it is moderately helpful but not comprehensive or fully cohesive in terms of context development."
