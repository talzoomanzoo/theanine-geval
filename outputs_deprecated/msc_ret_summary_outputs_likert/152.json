Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A suggested the name Zhao for one of the kittens.\n2. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n3. Speaker B has an older mellow cat and is concerned about training the new energetic kittens.\n4. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n5. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n6. Speaker B has two sick kitties and recently received a rescue.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several relevant pieces of information that can assist Speaker B in generating a response to the dialogue context. Sentence 1 directly connects to Speaker A's question about naming the kittens, indicating an ongoing discussion about choosing names. Sentence 2 highlights Speaker B's inclination towards Mandarin names for the rescue kittens, which is relevant for a discussion about names. Sentence 3 offers context about Speaker B's existing cats and potential concerns with new kittens, which could influence conversational direction. Sentence 6 mentions Speaker B's situation with sick kitties and a recent rescue, adding potential layers to the discussion about names and adopting kittens. Sentences 4 and 5 are less directly related to the naming theme but provide context about Speaker A's interest in adopting a kitten. The overall memory structure helps establish a well-connected background for the dialogue participants' interactions, making it helpful for crafting a response, though some connections could be more explicit."
