    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place? Speaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping? Speaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B expresses concern about leaving a kitten alone during their family camping adventures.\n2. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n3. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n4. Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys.\n5. Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys.\n6. Speaker A is offering advice and seems to have experience with children.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some information about Speaker B's concerns and parenting, as well as Speaker A's interests and experiences related to zoos. However, it lacks direct relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which revolves around a recent camping trip and Speaker A's interest in camping. The primary topic of camping is only indirectly related to Speaker B's concern about leaving a kitten alone during camping trips. The rest of the MEMORY focuses on topics related to zoos, which is not directly connected to the current dialogue. Additionally, the MEMORY doesn't present a coherent development or causality between Speaker A and Speaker B's interactions in relation to the camping topic. Consequently, while there is some useful background information, the MEMORY does not substantially aid in generating a proper next response."
