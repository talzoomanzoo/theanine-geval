Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job. Speaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career. Speaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday. Speaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud. Speaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\n3. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\n4. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n5. Speaker A is studying computer science and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth.\n6. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides useful information that is relevant and helps inform the dialogue between Speaker A and Speaker B. Key elements from the DISCUSSION CONTEXT, such as Speaker A's interest in teaching and studying computer science, are well-supported by Memory 1, which ties back into the conversation around career aspirations. Additionally, MEMORY sentences 3, 4, and 6 provide contextual background about Speaker B's major in linguistics and their contemplation of further education and job opportunities, echoing the advice-focused discussion about career paths and options. This connection allows the language model to generate responses that can naturally flow from and build upon prior interactions. Although some entries in the MEMORY are not directly related to the immediate DIALOGUE CONTEXT, they are still well-structured and provide essential context. The spectrum of aspirations (e.g., college professor, developing apps) enriches understanding and echoes relevant themes. However, there could be a slightly more direct mention or relation to the teaching pursuit of Speaker B to hit the highest score."
