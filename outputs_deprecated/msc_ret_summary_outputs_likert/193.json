Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam? Speaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A. Speaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now? Speaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done.  Speaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on? Speaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study? Speaker B: Ah, English should be easier than History. Sure, I can help you. What do you need to do exactly? Write an essay? Speaker A: Yeah, we have to write an essay and we have a spelling component towards the end of the exam, I sure could use a little help!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring.\n2. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n3. Speaker A wishes to get better grades and is hopeful for a soccer scholarship.\n4. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n5. Speaker B has been getting all A's in the sports medicine class.\n6. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant context that could be useful for generating responses in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, it includes information about Speaker A's struggle with history class (1), which directly ties to the conversation about the history exam. However, the MEMORY also contains several points that are not directly related to the current context, such as Speaker B's sports medicine training and their performance in those classes (2, 5, 6). While these pieces of information are structured in a way that highlights the speakers' academic struggles and aspirations, they do not contribute directly to the development of the ongoing conversation about the exams, particularly the history and English exams. Therefore, while the MEMORY is somewhat helpful, it does not provide a clean and direct contribution to the ongoing dialogues, which is why it received a mid-range score."
