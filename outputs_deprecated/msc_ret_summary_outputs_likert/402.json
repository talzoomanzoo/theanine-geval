Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue. Speaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad. Speaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs! Speaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours? Speaker A: Ikea! Their furniture is not to expensive and they have all kinds of furniture that'll go with whatever scheme you're going for. What kind of patio furniture were you looking for? Like a barbeque, chairs, hammock? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing furniture and home decor choices.\n2. Speaker A is looking to redecorate their house and likes purple furniture.\n3. Speaker A recently bought new furniture for their house, including a couch, recliner, and patio furniture.\n4. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to meet up to discuss the furniture exchange.\n6. Speaker A is looking forward to spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I was thinking of getting a nice outdoor dining set with some comfortable chairs. Ikea sounds like a good option, I'll have to check it out. Thanks for the suggestion!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The information in the MEMORY is somewhat helpful but not entirely aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While MEMORY provides information about Speaker A and Speaker B discussing furniture and home decor choices, which aligns with the patio furniture discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, it seems slightly disjointed or not entirely consistent with the direction the conversation is taking. For instance, MEMORY mentions Speaker A liking purple furniture, which contradicts Speaker B's dislike of the green and purple color scheme mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Furthermore, the MEMORY discusses specific furniture items Speaker A recently bought, but these are not directly relevant to the conversation about patio furniture ideas. The concept of Speaker A and Speaker B meeting up aligns with the plan to meet for a barbecue, but the details about enjoying new furniture indoors are not very relevant to the outdoor BBQ context. Overall, MEMORY contains some useful context about the speakers' interactions, but it could be more clearly connected to the current conversation's focus."
