Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it! Thank you for the recommendation. Speaker B: Of course. I recommend that movie to everyone I meet. I think I've watched it over one hundred times. So what is the next movie on your list to watch soon?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in watching movies, mentioned Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman.\n2. Speaker B is knowledgeable about movies and provides recommendations based on Speaker A's preferences.\n3. Speaker A relies on Speaker B for movie suggestions, mentioning a preference for comedies.\n4. Speaker B enjoys watching suspense films, action, SF, horror, westerns, drama, and occasional good comedy.\n5. Speaker A enjoyed the movie \"Coming to America\" and expressed interest in watching its sequel.\n6. Speaker B used to teach Film Studies and carefully chooses what movies to watch.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, assisting a language model in generating an appropriate response for Speaker A. It includes details on Speaker A's interest in movies and the specific mention of \"Pulp Fiction\" (point 1), which ties directly to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A has just watched and loved \"Pulp Fiction.\" Additionally, the MEMORY mentions that Speaker B is knowledgeable about movies and frequently makes recommendations based on Speaker A's preferences (point 2), also directly connecting to the context where Speaker B recommends movies. The preference for comedies is mentioned (point 3), which is helpful for directing future recommendations or responses. Although some points, like the variety of genres Speaker B enjoys (point 4) and their past experience teaching Film Studies (point 6), are not directly related to the CONTEXT, they are still well-structured and could inform the modelâ€™s understanding of Speaker B's expertise and preferences, potentially influencing further dialogue. Overall, the MEMORY provides valuable contextual cues for future interactions and is phrased in a synthetic manner that reflects past developments."
