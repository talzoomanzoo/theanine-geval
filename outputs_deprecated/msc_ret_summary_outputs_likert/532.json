Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends? Speaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do. Speaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mentions the outdoor activities they plan to do in Alaska, such as hiking.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together.\n3. Speaker B is unsure about what else there is to do in Alaska besides hiking.\n4. Speaker A has the impression that Alaska is cold and snowy, wondering if there are ski slopes there.\n5. Speaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet.\n6. Speaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "I will evaluate the MEMORY based on its helpfulness for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nMEMORY contains several pieces of information about a trip to Alaska, involving outdoor activities like hiking and skiing. However, in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, Speaker B expresses interest in dog sledding and concerns about Alaska's daylight hours. Speaker A talks about different daylight and darkness times and suggests star gazing.\n\nLet's analyze each memory point for relevance and contribution:\n\n1. Summarizes a generic outdoor activity (hiking) Speaker A might want to do, but does not relate to the specific interest in dog sledding or daylight concerns.\n\n2. Informative context that both speakers are planning a trip to Alaska together, helpful for establishing relevance in the dialogue.\n\n3. Points out Speaker B's uncertainty about activities, which might seem relevant, but the context already specifies a particular activity of interest (dog sledding).\n\n4. Reflects assumptions about skiing which isn't directly aligned with the dog sledding or daylight inquiry.\n\n5. Speaker B planning an Alaskan vacation but not having much planned yet aligns indirectly with Speaker B's need to figure out daylight timing for activities.\n\n6. Generalizes Speaker A's familiarity with Alaska and certain activities but doesn't specifically facilitate the dialogue about daylight or dog sledding.\n\nOverall, MEMORY touches on the travel and vacation theme but lacks specific alignment with the current conversation's focus on dog sledding and daylight timing issues.\n\nHelpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe memories provide some basic contextual background about a joint trip to Alaska, which is valuable. However, they fall short in directly supporting the specific conversational topics being addressed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT (dog sledding, daylight concerns) and could be improved with details more relevant to those specifics."
