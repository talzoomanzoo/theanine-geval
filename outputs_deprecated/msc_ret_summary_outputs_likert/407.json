Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue. Speaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad. Speaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs! Speaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours? Speaker A: Ikea! Their furniture is not to expensive and they have all kinds of furniture that'll go with whatever scheme you're going for. What kind of patio furniture were you looking for? Like a barbeque, chairs, hammock?  Speaker B: I guess I was going to get like an umbrella table and some chairs to go with it or maybe even a screened in gazebo with a fire pit in the middle. Speaker A: That's a great idea! Sounds like a very nice place for a barbeque. What were you planning on grilling for the barbeque?  Speaker B: I'll get the steaks to grill if you will bring the corn. And I have a request for you to play on the guitar, I know you are into country so if you could maybe play a song or two by Miranda Lambert, that would be awesome. Speaker A: Of course! I love Miranda Lambert, any specific song requests?  Speaker B: Nothing specific I love all her songs, I think I'm going get off here so I can try to order that gazebo.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is looking forward to spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights.\n2. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy barbecuing and have a love for pets.\n4. Speaker B plans to bring a new marinade and a six pack of beer for the gathering.\n5. Speaker B plans to grill steaks this weekend and prefers using an old charcoal grill over a gas one.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing furniture and home decor choices.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains some elements that are somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as mentions of grilling and furniture. For example, MEMORY point 6 briefly aligns with the dialogue's discussion of furniture and color schemes, and point 5 touches upon grilling which relates to the barbecue. However, the MEMORY lacks specific details that strongly connect with the dialogue context, such as the conversation about picking a repertoire for guitar playing, bug repellents, or specific patio furniture options like a gazebo. The MEMORY lacks a coherent development of past interactions that would provide significant contextual cues to help generate the next response in the conversation. Overall, while there are a few points that are tangentially related to the dialogue, the MEMORY does not provide helpful information in a structured and connected manner that supports generating an appropriate response."
