Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class and enjoys it.\n2. Speaker A is planning to take summer courses soon and is very active, enjoying martial arts.\n3. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts.\n4. Speaker A is enrolled in a class on the history of martial arts and is majoring in athletic training.\n5. Speaker A is a martial arts teacher and student and is pursuing an athletic training degree in college.\n6. Both Speaker A and Speaker B are interested in martial arts and enjoy learning new things.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's awesome! I recently started an online class about the history of martial arts and I'm really enjoying it. It's so fascinating to learn about the origins and traditions of different martial arts styles.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a comprehensive understanding of Speaker A's involvement and interest in martial arts, which is directly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A talks about attending another martial arts class. The MEMORY outlines Speaker A's enjoyment of martial arts, their plans to take further courses, their dual role as both a martial arts student and teacher, and their pursuit of an athletic training degree. Additionally, the MEMORY notes Speaker B's involvement in martial arts and their interest in learning, further establishing a shared interest between the speakers. This information is structured clearly, allowing the language model to generate relevant and contextually rich responses. Overall, the MEMORY offers helpful details that align well with the context of the conversation."
