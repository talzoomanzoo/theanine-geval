Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet?  Speaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name? Speaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A suggested the name Zhao for one of the kittens.\n2. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n3. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n4. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n5. Speaker B has two sick kitties and recently received a rescue.\n6. Speaker B has an older mellow cat and is concerned about training the new energetic kittens.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's wonderful! I'm sure Tasha would love having some new friends around. Let me know if you need any advice on introducing them to each other.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY indicates that Speaker B is considering naming their kittens with Mandarin names, which aligns with Speaker B's interest in naming a kitten \"Oreo\" based on its color. This suggests that Speaker B is thoughtfully selecting names, though not Mandarin in the provided example, based on specific traits, similar to the color-based choice of Oreo. Additionally, the MEMORY mentions Speaker A's interest in adopting kittens, which is directly related to the dialogue context where Speaker A mentions looking into adopting kittens.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY sentences are relevant to past interactions and are naturally phrased, indicating the development of both speakers' situations related to pet adoption. The mention of Speaker B's concern about training new kittens alongside an older cat adds depth to the consideration of kitten behavior and naming. However, some information such as the parrot named Tasha is not directly related to the current naming discussion, which slightly limits the score from being perfect."
