Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for. Speaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\n3. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n4. Speaker A is looking for a job and new camping gear, specifically a hammock.\n5. Speaker A plans to bring sandwiches and fruit for the hike, specifically asking about veggie sandwiches for Speaker B.\n6. Speaker A will use the money earned from the store to buy the hammock online.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful and relevant information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. There are sentences that clearly establish the connection and relevance of Speaker A and Speaker B's past interactions:\n\n1. Sentence 1 is directly relevant as it connects Speaker A's job application to the location near a hiking trail, which could suggest contextual elements like convenience or alignment with Speaker A's interests.\n2. Sentence 2 adds depth by indicating a personal connection (an acquaintance of Speaker B) to the store environment, which could be comforting or influential for Speaker A's decision.\n3. Sentence 3 gives insight into Speaker Aâ€™s background and situation, providing important context for understanding why the job offer might be significant.\n6. Sentence 6 provides potential motivations for Speaker A taking the job (buying a hammock) and links back to their expressed interest in hiking gear from earlier conversations.\n\nWhile some information is more relevant than others (like Sentence 5, which is less connected to the job discussion), overall, MEMORY is structured to enable the language model to generate contextually aware responses. The sentences that are not directly related to the job offer are still naturally phrased, making them easy to distinguish as tangential and not disrupting the coherence of potential replies."
