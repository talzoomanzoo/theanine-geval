Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her? Speaker B: Hi there, hope you are wlll and managing to save up for your Italy trip?  Thank for asking about the Greek mythology study, we are doing very well. It helps because i am so passionate about it and hope to get to the Greek islands soon\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology.\n2. Speaker A is fascinated by the architecture of Italy and enjoys studying history, especially through reading and watching documentaries.\n3. Speaker B enjoys Greek mythology and did a case study on Poseidon, the God of the Sea, Earthquakes, and Horses.\n4. Speaker A is planning to travel to Italy alone for Spring Break and has friends from Europe meeting up with them.\n5. Speaker B has been to Italy in the past and enjoyed the food there.\n6.

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you for asking about my daughter. She's doing well, thank you. I'm glad to hear that your Greek mythology study is going well. Greece sounds like an amazing place to visit, especially with your interest in Greek mythology. I hope you get to visit the Greek islands soon!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context involves a discussion about Greek mythology, Speaker A's travel plans, and managing savings for an Italy trip. Hereâ€™s how the MEMORY is helpful:\n\n1. MEMORY 1 establishes Speaker B's interest in Greek mythology and visiting Greece, which is directly linked to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A asks about sharing Greek mythology with Speaker B's daughter.\n\n2. MEMORY 2 and MEMORY 4 are helpful as they relate to Speaker A's interest and travel plans to Italy, which is referenced in Speaker B's response about saving for the trip.\n\n3. MEMORY 3 is relevant as it details Speaker B's enjoyment of Greek mythology, specifically referencing a case study on Poseidon, which connects well to the conversation's theme.\n\n4. While MEMORY 5 and MEMORY 6 are less directly related to the immediate dialogue context, they are still phrased in a way that adds background information without disrupting the understanding of the ongoing interaction.\n\nOverall, the memories are well-connected, naturally phrased, and relevant to the dialogue's themes, thus facilitating the generation of appropriate responses."
