Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n2. Speaker B mentions that Resident Evil can be scary and provides some tips for playing it.\n3. Speaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII.\n4. Speaker B plays Resident Evil VIII alone in the dark to make it scarier.\n5. Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World.\n6. Speaker A does not play video games often but may consider trying them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I actually played a lot of Resident Evil VIII this week. It's such a thrilling game, especially when played in the dark.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant and helpful information for a language model to generate a proper next response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY provides context about previous interactions related to playing Resident Evil, such as Speaker B's experience with the game, their enjoyment of similar games, and Speaker A's hesitance to play Resident Evil. These details are naturally structured, showing the connection and development of the conversation around gaming interests and experiences. This enables a language model to craft a response that could acknowledge these past interactions and possibly discuss more on the topic of Resident Evil or gaming in general. However, some sentences like Speaker A's interest in Jurassic Park: World, while relevant to gaming, are slightly less directly relevant than others. Overall, the MEMORY is well-connected and cohesive, justifying a score of 4."
