Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet?  Speaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name? Speaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended.  Speaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along! Speaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n2. Speaker A has a parrot as a pet and is considering adopting a rescue kitten.\n3. Speaker A is interested in training tips for the kittens and is open to adopting one despite having a parrot.\n4. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n5. Speaker A's parrot Tasha has seen cats before and ignores them.\n6. Speaker B has two sick kitties and recently received a rescue.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It sounds like Tasha has a strong personality! It might be entertaining to see how she interacts with the new kittens. Good luck with the adoption process!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that can be helpful in generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it mentions that Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha, which is relevant because Tasha was discussed in the context. Additionally, it states Speaker A's interest in adopting a rescue kitten, which aligns with the interaction in the dialogue. However, there are several points in MEMORY that seem inconsistent or give repeated information, such as Speaker A both having interest in adopting and already looking into adoption without a clear timeline or connection to current dialogue. Speaker B's intention to consider different names based on personalities also adds a bit of confusion. While the sentences are mostly naturally structured, there is a lack of clear development or causality between some MEMORY elements and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, leading to a rating of 3."
