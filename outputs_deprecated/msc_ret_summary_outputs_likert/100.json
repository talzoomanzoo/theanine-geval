    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make? Speaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it. Speaker A: I would love to, I enjoy cooking so maybe you can teach me to make it, too? Speaker B: Yeah definitely! I know you like hot foods, so if you learn and can make them fresh it will taste amazing. Have you tried any new foods lately?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe.\n2. Speaker A likes cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally.\n3. Speaker A enjoys cooking and finds it helpful for stress relief.\n4. Speaker A plays the drums and loves making food for others.\n5. Speaker A cooked steak, fried potatoes, and shrimp for dinner with their father.\n6. Speaker A enjoys surfing and offers to give Speaker B lessons.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I actually tried making a homemade curry dish recently, it turned out pretty good! Cooking is such a fun way to experiment with flavors.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides several pieces of information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but not all are directly helpful. The first memory point is somewhat relevant as it mentions the grandmother's garlic chicken recipe, which ties in with Speaker B's mention of garlic chicken in the dialogue. This helps establish Speaker B's fondness for the recipe and adds a personal touch, aiding in the understanding of Speaker B's reaction to the suggestion of cooking together.\n\nThe second and third memory points briefly indicate that Speaker A likes cooking and finds it to be stress-relieving, which is somewhat related to Speaker A's interest in learning to make new dishes in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, these points do not add significant new insight into the ongoing conversation.\n\nThe fourth, fifth, and sixth memory points are less relevant as they focus on Speaker A's other interests (playing drums, having dinner with their father, and surfing). These points don't aid much in the generation of a response directly related to cooking or the specific foods mentioned.\n\nOverall, while some aspects of the MEMORY reflect the general topic of cooking, not all points are directly relevant to the immediate DIALOGUE CONTEXT or provide clear development."
