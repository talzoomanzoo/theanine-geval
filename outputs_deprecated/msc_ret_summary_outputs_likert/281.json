Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on! Speaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A learned how to make jello from their grandma, turning it into a family tradition.\n2. Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes.\n3. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n4. Speaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners.\n5. Speaker B regrets not having the opportunity to spend quality time with their grandparents, who were busy running a grocery store before they passed away.\n6. Speaker B does not do a lot of cooking or baking but is interested in learning.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's wonderful that you're passing on your grandmother's jello recipe to your kids! Maybe you could find a way to make a healthier version with less sugar so you can still enjoy it together. It's all about creating new memories while honoring the old ones.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY is quite helpful in generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memory sentences provide relevant background information linking Speaker A to the topic of family traditions and jello recipes, which aligns well with the contextual discussion about passing down recipes within families. For example, the connection of Speaker A learning jello recipes from their grandmother and the family tradition tied to jello is directly related to the topic being discussed by Speaker B. Additionally, Speaker A's connection to the cherry flavor jello enhances this context by providing a personal touch.\n\nThe MEMORY also sets a foundation for identifying common ground or differences between Speaker A and Speaker B, such as Speaker B's lack of experience in cooking and their regret regarding not spending time with grandparents, while Speaker A has strong familial ties to cooking traditions. This setup allows the language model to generate a response that could foster deeper dialogue, such as sharing stories, comparing experiences, or offering advice.\n\nHowever, there are a couple of points in MEMORY, such as the suggestion of a surrogate grandma (sentence 3), that feel less naturally integrated, and could be clearer in their connection or relevance. Overall, though, MEMORY is informative and well-connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, thus justifying a score of 4."
