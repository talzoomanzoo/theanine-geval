Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recommends Speaker A to watch 'Miracle'.\n2. Speaker B's husband enjoys Disney sports movies, such as 'Miracle'.\n3. Speaker B's kids enjoyed watching 'Luca' and said it was good.\n4. Speaker B enjoys watching movies with her kids.\n5. Speaker A has seen the Disney movie 'Luca' recently.\n6. Speaker B's kids enjoy watching Disney movies, which Speaker B also finds good.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for generating a response in relation to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It clearly establishes that Speaker B recommended the movie 'Miracle' to Speaker A, which directly connects to the context where Speaker A mentions having watched and enjoyed 'Miracle'. It also provides additional contextual background about Speaker B's family's movie preferences, such as enjoying Disney sports movies like 'Miracle' and other Disney movies, which could be useful for Speaker B to further engage in the conversation. The sentences are well-structured and logical, demonstrating past interactions effectively. However, not all details are directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which slightly reduces the score, but overall the MEMORY is helpful."
