Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n2. Speaker A is worried about gas mileage and asks about the fuel efficiency of Speaker B's car.\n3. Speaker B received a new car from their mom and plans to drive during spring break.\n4. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n5. Speaker B's new car is black, and it is their first new car after driving pre-owned cars before.\n6. Speaker A is older and mentions having blue hair already.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "No, I actually decided to drive instead. I got a new car from my mom and I'm excited to take it out for a spin during spring break.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be useful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The first memory point directly references a trip, which is aligned with Speaker A's question about plane tickets. It suggests that Speaker B has not started packing, which implies that they may not have completed other travel arrangements, such as purchasing plane tickets. This could lead Speaker B to comment on the status of their trip preparations in their next response.\n\nHowever, the rest of the MEMORY contains information that is not directly relevant to the context of plane ticket purchase. For example, details about the car's color or that it's Speaker B's first new car are less pertinent to the immediate context and the query about plane tickets. Points about Speaker A's concerns regarding gas mileage or their past spring breaks also don't contribute directly to the question at hand.\n\nThe MEMORY is structured in a way that provides some context about Speaker B's trip and past conversations, but there is limited direct connectivity to the question of purchasing plane tickets, which limits its overall helpfulness in generating a specific next response to the dialogue context provided."
