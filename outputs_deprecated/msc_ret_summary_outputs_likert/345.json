Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read. Speaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting?  Speaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far. Speaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes.  Speaker A: why don't you like books like that? Speaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading? Speaker A: Not yet.  I think Netflix is going to make it into a movie soon.  They might finally convince me to pay for a subscription haha. Speaker B: Well if it's any good I know you'll be watching the whole thing. Speaker A: you know it.  And I know that you would just fall asleep during it whether it's any good or not. Speaker B: Is there a lot of violence in your book? I couldn't stand to read it if there was.  Speaker A: There's a little bit.  Mostly just when describing how the crimes occurred though.  There are also some fight scenes between the cops and the criminals.  It's not too bad.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n2. Speaker B has a son and enjoys reading books, particularly about animals.\n3. Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix.\n4. Speaker A has grandchildren and enjoys watching movies with them.\n5. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n6. Speaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I can handle a bit of action, but I prefer to read about animals peacefully roaming in the wild.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful information for generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It reveals that Speaker B enjoys reading books, particularly about animals, which aligns with the dialogue where Speaker B mentions liking animal books. It also hints that Speaker A has grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix, which connects to the context where Speaker A talks about not watching their grandkids and reading a book instead. However, much of the information in MEMORY regarding Speaker Aâ€™s grandchildren and Netflix habits is not directly relevant to the conversation or does not provide deep insight into their past interactions, resulting in a mid-range score. The MEMORY could have been more directly relevant to the dialogue context to aid in response generation."
