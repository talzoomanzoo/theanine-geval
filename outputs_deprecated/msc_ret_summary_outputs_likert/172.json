Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately? Speaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me. Speaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway? Speaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day! I'll make it as fun as possible. Speaker B: I will someday. just not in the summer when all the bugs are out! Where do you go hiking the most? Speaker A: I like to go hiking in the local trails here. I am familiar with them and there's so many routes that I can take. Sadly, the bugs are as bad here as they are anywhere else..... Speaker B: They can't be that bad in the fall right? I hope? Do you camp most every weekend? Speaker A: A least a couple of times a month. Sometimes, yeah, I go every weekend to relax. Being in nature is so relaxing to me. And nah the bugs aren't too bad in the fall and winter. There's a beautiful river along one trail that I bet you'd love to see.  Speaker B: That sounds like it would be relaxing. I would probable be okay if we didn't run into any wolves, bears etc. Have you ever came across any predators when you were camping?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks.\n2. Speaker A enjoys camping trips and looking for wild animals in the woods.\n3. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking as free activities.\n4. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n5. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n6. Speaker A is comfortable around animals in the woods but admits a bear would make them jumpy.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've encountered some deer, raccoons, and even a few coyotes, but thankfully no bears or wolves. Although I have to admit, the thought of running into a bear does make me a bit jumpy. But with proper precautions and being aware of our surroundings, we should be fine.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe memory provides some helpful information regarding Speaker A's enjoyment of camping and hiking, as well as their comfort with animals in the woods, which aligns with the dialogue context of discussing hikes and outdoors. Specifically, MEMORY sentence 1 relates to Speaker Aâ€™s enjoyment of hiking and camping, which is relevant to the dialogue context where Speaker A talks about leading hikes and enjoying camping. MEMORY sentence 6 about being comfortable around animals but wary of bears is directly related to Speaker B's concern about encountering predators while camping, making it quite useful for generating a relevant response in the dialogue context.\n\nHowever, there are sentences in the memory that are less relevant or not directly connected to the dialogue context. For example, sentences 2, 3, 4, and 5 mention Speaker A looking for wild animals and planning to do part of the Appalachian Trail, and Speaker B enjoying a hike, none of which are mentioned or alluded to in the dialogue context. Hence, while the memory is somewhat helpful and contains relevant parts, it lacks a cohesive connection throughout all sentences, which limits its overall helpfulness."
