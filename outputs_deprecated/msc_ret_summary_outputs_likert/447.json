Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive. Speaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price? Speaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music Speaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it. Speaker A: I'll keep trying! Have you had any luck lately? Speaker B: No I haven't! I keep hoping that I will so I can buy my dreamhouse but I know the chances are low.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n3. Speaker B bought 20 lotto tickets with the same numbers, aiming to get a bigger share of the jackpot if they win.\n4. Speaker A bought 50 lotto tickets with different numbers to increase their chances of winning.\n5. Speaker B's children have been sick, and Speaker B also had a fever, possibly influencing their decision to buy 20 lotto tickets.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B have a friendly interaction and part ways on a positive note.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant details that can aid in generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, sentences 1, 2, and 5 provide context about previous conversations regarding the lottery, which ties into the recent mention of winning the lotto to help with expenses in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Moreover, Speaker B's health issues mentioned in sentence 5 could be an avenue for empathy or further conversation from Speaker A. However, some of the other details, such as the specific numbers of lotto tickets bought and the strategies mentioned, do not directly contribute to developing the immediate conversation. While the MEMORY does offer some useful information, certain aspects lack direct relevance to the current dialogue, leading to this middle-ground score. The sentences are relatively well-structured and coherent in their presentation of past interactions, but they could be more directly aligned with enhancing the ongoing conversation."
