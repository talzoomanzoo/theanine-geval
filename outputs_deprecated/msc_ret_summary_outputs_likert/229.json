Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing.\n2. Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden.\n3. Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more.\n4. Speaker A jokes about space weeds and expresses a desire to see space.\n5. Speaker A plays the clarinet in a band concert and has a solar investment for their office building.\n6. Speaker B is focused on developing renewable energy sources for their inventions.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information for Speaker B to generate a proper next response to Speaker A's request for gardening suggestions. Specifically, Sentence 2 indicates that Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, suggesting that Speaker B is in a good position to provide advice. Sentence 1 suggests Speaker A might need more basic advice due to their struggles with gardening. Sentence 3 hints at Speaker Bâ€™s eagerness to spend more time gardening, indicating they may have fresh ideas or experiences to share. However, sentences 4, 5, and 6 are less relevant to the context of gardening advice and do not clearly demonstrate a connection or ongoing interaction related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. They are naturally phrased enough to discern their lack of direct relevance, but they do not build on the garden-related interaction. Overall, the MEMORY could be more useful if it included more direct interactions or past conversations about gardening between the speakers."
