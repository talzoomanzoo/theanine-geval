Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids? Speaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call! Speaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand. Speaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip?  Speaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery Speaker B: Yes I think that's a great idea, how is work at the library? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n2. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n3. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park.\n4. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like.\n5. Speaker B has grandkids who are more interested in phones and tablets than musical instruments.\n6. Speaker A is a retired librarian who enjoys implementing creative activities in their library.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Work at the library is going well. I've been brainstorming some new creative activities to implement for the community. It's always a fun challenge to come up with something new and engaging for everyone.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a reasonably helpful amount of contextual information about the speakers, though it lacks full coherence and relevance to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences about Speaker B's interest in making the fishing trip an annual tradition, and their grandkids' mixed reactions to fishing, are directly related to the ongoing conversation about fishing trips, thus providing helpful context. Information about Speaker B spending time with grandkids, and their grandkids' interests in technology, while not directly relevant to the specific dialogue, offer background knowledge which could be useful for other conversation contexts. However, Speaker A's mention of being a retired librarian conflicts with the context where they discuss balancing work and family, suggesting that MEMORY does not fully align with the current scenario. Some sentences provide interesting facts but are not strongly connected to the specific dialogue context, making it moderately helpful overall."
