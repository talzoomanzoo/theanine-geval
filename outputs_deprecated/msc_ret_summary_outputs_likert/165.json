    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not! Speaker B: Have you been hiking lately? Speaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it\n2. Speaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks.\n3. Speaker A has planned several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail.\n4. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking as free activities.\n5. Speaker A is nervous about the Appalachian Trail hike, as they don't usually do full day hikes.\n6. Speaker A leads hikes for the group they camp with, which are usually an hour or two long.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great that you're getting your friends out on the trails with you! It's always nice to share the experience with others, even if they do get tired quickly.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Several key points are directly related to the hiking theme discussed: Speaker A enjoys hiking, has planned future hiking trips including parts of the Appalachian Trail, and often leads hikes for a group. These details help establish Speaker A's experiences and attitudes towards hiking, which are pertinent to their recent experience leading a hike, as mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY also mentions Speaker A's nervousness about longer hikes, which could be used by the model to add depth to responses about hiking preparations. Speaker B's memory that they enjoyed a recent long hike could lead to a connection with Speaker A's plans or experiences. However, the MEMORY could benefit from being more connected and explicitly phrased in terms of past interactions between the two speakers, which would warrant a perfect score."
