    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies! Speaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?   Speaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mainly cares for dogs at the animal shelter, but also cats, and loves when new puppies are brought in.\n2. Speaker B is interested in volunteering and prefers cats over dogs, especially kittens.\n3. Speaker A loves animals, especially puppies, and visits shelters in every city they go to.\n4. Speaker B is a 26-year-old workaholic who is unsure about their career and doesn't have strong opinions on puppies.\n5. Speaker A dreams of meeting all the puppies from history when they can move through space and time.\n6. Speaker A is busy with work and used to foster puppies but no longer does.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I can see why you love puppies so much! They sound like they bring so much joy and energy. I think I might prefer the independence of cats, but I can definitely understand the appeal of puppies.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about Speaker A's affinity for puppies which aligns with Speaker A's statements in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically when they mention that puppies are cuter and their specific attributes. However, it lacks direct connection in Speaker B's perspective from the context, which involves a discussion about the differences between puppies and kittens. While the MEMORY does provide some information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A's love for puppies, not all sentences are directly linked to the current conversation or are particularly helpful for developing the next response related to that specific context. The information about Speaker A's dream and Speaker B's age and work habits seem less relevant to the ongoing discussion, showing some natural phrasing but limited usefulness in generating a direct response for the context provided. Overall, the MEMORY has relevant elements but lacks comprehensive connectivity to the immediate context, yielding a middle score."
