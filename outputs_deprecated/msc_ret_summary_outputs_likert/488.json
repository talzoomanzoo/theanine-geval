Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like. Speaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk? Speaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is an artist who walks through nature for work.\n2. Speaker A is a city dweller who walks to work instead of driving.\n3. Speaker B lives in the country, loves nature, and works with animals.\n4. Speaker B enjoys reading the Odd Thomas and Dark Tower series and finds inspiration for their artwork during nature walks.\n5. Speaker A enjoys reading sci-fi and mysteries, while Speaker B prefers fantasy books.\n6. Speaker A asks about Speaker B's new artwork and acknowledges their need for inspiration.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds lovely! Sometimes the easy trails can be just as rewarding, especially when you just need a peaceful walk to clear your mind. Did you see any interesting wildlife along the river?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several relevant pieces of information regarding Speaker B's interests and lifestyle, which can be useful in generating the next response in the dialogue. Specifically, Memory sentences provide information about Speaker B's love for nature and how it integrates with their work (Sentences 1, 3, and 4), creating a cohesive narrative that connects well to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A went on a nature walk and thought Speaker B would like it. Additionally, memory Sentence 6 demonstrates a past interaction where Speaker A acknowledged Speaker B's need for artistic inspiration, which ties into how a walk could inspire art, an avenue for Speaker B to provide a response. Overall, the information is structured to show their relationship and shared experiences in a way that can influence dialogue. Sentences less relevant to this specific context, such as reading preferences (Sentence 5), are stated clearly and don't detract significantly from the overall helpfulness."
