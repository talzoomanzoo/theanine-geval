Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing? Speaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from? Speaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there. Speaker B: That's great. I have gotten my pets from the shelter and they seem happy I brought them home. I have a hard time saying no to them which is why I have so many pets. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs. Do you have a name in mind for your cat? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions.\n2. Speaker A is considering getting kittens and thinks rats can be smart.\n3. Speaker B is in college, paints on the side, and has five dogs and three rats.\n4. Speaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals, discovered love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets.\n5. Both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy the company of their pets and think they are smart and playful.\n6. Speaker A prefers adopting pets from shelters rather than from breeders.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a fair amount of useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it mentions Speaker A's preference for adopting pets from shelters (Memory Sentence 6), which links directly to the context where Speaker A talks about getting a new cat from a shelter. Additionally, Speaker B's painting habits and background (Memory Sentence 3 and 4) are pertinent, given the portrait discussion in the context. The memory also effectively establishes the connection between both speakers through their shared interest in pets (Memory Sentence 5), and Speaker A's contemplation on kittens and Speaker B's imaginative interactions add depth (Memory Sentences 1 and 2). While not all sentences directly connect to the current dialogue, they are structured naturally, allowing for easy identification of relevance. However, a couple of sentences (like Speaker B's preference for Persian cats) do not clearly pertain to the immediate context, slightly reducing the fluidity and direct applicability."
