Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play?  Speaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music. Speaker A: ah right, who's your favourite rock band? Speaker B: I'm big fan of aerosmith. When do you learn music. Whom teach you? Speaker A: aerosmith are great, have you ever seen them live? I have been playing drums since i was a kid, my father taught me when I was young and from then on I just taught myself\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is in a band and plays music, possibly a musician.\n2. Speaker A is in a band where they play the drums and write music, with 4 members including the singer who is their best friend.\n3. Speaker B is willing to teach Speaker A how to fish and cook.\n4. Speaker A is part of a band that tours different countries for their music.\n5. Speaker A wants to see Sublime live one day but doesn't go to many concerts other than the ones their band plays in.\n6. Speaker A was good at writing in school, while Speaker B was bad at math and preferred fishing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's impressive that you've been playing drums since you were a kid! Maybe one day I can teach you how to fish and cook in return for all the music knowledge you have.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY includes some potentially helpful information, such as Speaker A being in a band and playing drums, which could connect to the context where Speaker A mentions playing drums since childhood. However, most of the sentences in the MEMORY do not directly relate to the current dialogue context or provide useful information for generating the next response. For instance, information about Speaker B teaching fishing or Speaker A's school performance seems irrelevant to the ongoing conversation about music and rock bands. Additionally, the memory lacks coherence and does not naturally connect the sentences to demonstrate a clear development of past interactions between the speakers."
