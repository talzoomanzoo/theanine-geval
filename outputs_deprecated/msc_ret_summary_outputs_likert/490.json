    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like. Speaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk? Speaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous. Speaker B: That sounds amazing! Did you bring a pet? I love doing the harder trails with my dog. Sometimes, it's very peaceful to get away from everything. Speaker A: No, I don't have any pets; my apartment seems too small for a dog and I would worry about them being lonely all day when I'm at work. I was thinking about getting a pair of cats, but I haven't committed yet. How nice fo ryou to have company when you're walking though! What kind of dog do you have?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B lives in the country, loves nature, and works with animals.\n2. Speaker B is an artist who walks through nature for work.\n3. Speaker A is a city dweller who walks to work instead of driving.\n4. Speaker B enjoys reading the Odd Thomas and Dark Tower series and finds inspiration for their artwork during nature walks.\n5. Speaker A asks about Speaker B's new artwork and acknowledges their need for inspiration.\n6. Speaker A enjoys reading sci-fi and mysteries, while Speaker B prefers fantasy books.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I have a border collie mix named Luna. She's full of energy and loves exploring the trails with me. Having a pet definitely adds to the experience. Cats can be great company too, they have their own kind of charm. If you do decide to get them, I'm sure they'll bring a lot of joy to your life.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides a mixed level of helpful information based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Some sentences give relevant background about Speaker B's connection to nature, which aligns with the topic of nature walks. For example, MEMORY points 1 and 2 provide context about Speaker B's affinity for nature. However, Speaker B's occupation or artistic inspiration, as mentioned in points 2 and 4, doesn't directly contribute to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about pets and trails.\n\nMEMORY points about Speaker A being a city dweller and mode of commuting (point 3) do not directly relate to the ongoing dialogue context. The preference for books (point 6) is also off-topic.\n\nOverall, MEMORY provides some context for Speaker B's lifestyle, which can be useful, but lacks direct relevance to the specific subject of this dialogue and, thus, results in an intermediate score of 3 for helpfulness."
