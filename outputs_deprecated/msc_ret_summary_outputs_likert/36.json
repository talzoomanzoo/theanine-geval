Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well? Speaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes? Speaker A: I want to take some martial art classes at school next year. What do you sggest I try? Speaker B: I mean I always recommend Karate since that's what I study! I can bring you by the dojo sometime if you want to see what it is like. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work.\n2. Speaker B signed up for classes at the local college and has a background in football and karate.\n3. Speaker B practices karate and works as a lifeguard but is looking for a different career.\n4. Speaker B attends football games at their old high school and finds that their football background helps in karate footwork.\n5. Speaker A is studying marketing and enjoys it.\n6. Speaker A has taken Spanish classes in the past and finds similarities between French and Spanish.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful and relevant information that could be beneficial for generating a next response in the dialogue context. Specifically, the fact that Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt (Sentence 1, 2, and 3) directly relates to the conversation about martial arts and could help inform Speaker A's decision on what martial art to try. However, other details in the MEMORY, such as Speaker B's involvement in IT work (Sentence 1), lifeguard job (Sentence 3), and football background (Sentences 2 and 4), while informative, do not directly contribute or provide causality to the current topic of discussion. The information about Speaker Aâ€™s background in marketing and language studies (Sentences 5 and 6) does not relate to the dialogue context and does not help in generating a relevant next response. Overall, while the MEMORY is naturally structured and provides some context regarding past interactions, only part of it is directly helpful for the current dialogue context."
