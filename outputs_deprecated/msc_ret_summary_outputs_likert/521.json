Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing? Speaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from? Speaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is working on other portraits and taking care of a sick dog.\n2. Speaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals, discovered love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets.\n3. Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions.\n4. Speaker B is in college, paints on the side, and has five dogs and three rats.\n5. Speaker A prefers adopting pets from shelters rather than from breeders.\n6. Speaker A is getting their portrait painted by Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great! Adopting from shelters is always a wonderful choice. Your new cat will surely appreciate being given a loving home.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several helpful pieces of information relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, sentence 1 is relevant as it connects to the ongoing discussion about portraits and mentions Speaker B's portrait activities. Sentence 5 is directly relevant as it aligns with Speaker A's preference for getting a new cat from a shelter, reinforcing their tendency to adopt from such places. Sentence 6 is also highly pertinent as it outlines the relationship between Speaker A and Speaker B concerning a portrait, which is the opening topic of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 2, 3, and 4, while not directly mentioned, add depth to Speaker B's character but may not aid directly in generating the next response related to the current dialogue. Overall, MEMORY provides good contextual background while also establishing Speaker B's interests and preferences, which can be useful in continuing the conversation. The MEMORY could reach a score of 5 if every sentence was directly tied to the current conversation or more tightly connected to the unfolding dialogue about pets and portraits."
