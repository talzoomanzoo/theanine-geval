    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone?  Speaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!).\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks.\n2. Speaker B got into motivational speaking because they needed it themselves to battle depression and anxiety.\n3. Speaker B's job involves motivating people to be successful and follow their dreams.\n4. Speaker B has run a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding.\n5. Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600.\n6. Speaker A is a runner who is working on improving their mile time and training for a marathon.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's fantastic to hear! Your passion for motivating others really shines through. I think your energy and positivity would be perfect for helping my friend get back into running. Let's make a plan and get them back on track together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains several pieces of information that are helpful for understanding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and aiding in generating a proper next response. The context involves a discussion about motivational speaking and running, and the MEMORY provides relevant background information.\n\n1. Speaker B being a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences (Sentence 1) is relevant because it directly ties into the dialogue's topic of motivational speaking.\n2. The reason behind Speaker B's involvement in motivational speaking (Sentence 2) offers deeper insight into their personal journey, adding depth to the conversation.\n3. Sentence 3 reiterates Speaker B's role and provides context for why they might be inclined to motivate others, directly aligning with the conversation theme.\n4. Sentences 4 and 6 are very relevant since Speaker B's marathon experience and Speaker A's running background provide a mutual interest in running, connecting with the dialogue's focus on motivating someone (potentially Speaker B) to run.\n5. Sentence 5 extends the connection between the two speakers in running-related activities, indicating shared plans and offering a foundation for interaction.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY is well-structured and offers useful insights directly relevant to the ongoing conversation, with naturally phrased information that moves the dialogue context forward. However, a perfect score was slightly withheld because the specific details in Sentences 2 and 5 regarding Speaker A's plans (while interesting) could be even more directly tied to the core conversation about motivational speaking and running."
