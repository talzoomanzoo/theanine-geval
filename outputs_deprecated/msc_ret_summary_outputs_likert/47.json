Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job. Speaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career. Speaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday. Speaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n2. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\n3. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n4. Speaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\n5. Speaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\n6. Speaker A is studying computer science and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you, that means a lot! My parents are supportive, but they just want me to do what makes me happy. I'm sure your parents feel the same way about your decision to pursue teaching. It's important to follow your passion.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, enhancing our understanding of Speaker A and Speaker B's past interactions and career motivations. For example, it mentions that Speaker A is interested in teaching and studying computer science with a focus on robotics, which aligns with their aspiration to teach robotics as mentioned in the dialogue. The MEMORY also highlights Speaker B's academic focus on linguistics and their consideration of a master's degree and a career in academia, offering context to the career decision struggles they mention. Furthermore, Speaker B's volunteering activities show their commitment to practical applications of their studies, complementing their desire for a practical job. However, some details like Speaker A working at a pizza shop and their specific goals about developing apps, while interesting, are not directly connected to the main topic of teaching career discussions and therefore slightly lower the score. Overall, the MEMORY is well-structured, with natural phrasing and connections, making it easier for the language model to incorporate relevant context into response generation."
