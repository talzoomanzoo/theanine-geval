Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it! Thank you for the recommendation. Speaker B: Of course. I recommend that movie to everyone I meet. I think I've watched it over one hundred times. So what is the next movie on your list to watch soon? Speaker A: Yeah it was great and I will also recommend to people when they ask what movie is good. So next is another one you recommended which is coming to America. What’s the next movie your going to watch?  Speaker B: There is a horror genre movie that was released just this week which I'm going to watch tonight. It is called \"Girl Next.\" Speaker A: Oh that sounds interesting, I will look into that and put it on my list. How has your job been going? Is there where you get all these great ideas for what to watch?  \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in watching movies, mentioned Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman.\n2. Speaker B is knowledgeable about movies and provides recommendations based on Speaker A's preferences.\n3. Speaker B enjoys watching suspense films, action, SF, horror, westerns, drama, and occasional good comedy.\n4. Speaker A relies on Speaker B for movie suggestions, mentioning a preference for comedies.\n5. Speaker B used to teach Film Studies and carefully chooses what movies to watch.\n6.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provided gives a decent amount of helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, although there is room for improvement in terms of structured connection and relevance. The sentences in MEMORY contain details about both Speaker A and Speaker B's interests in movies, which is helpful given the context of the conversation about film recommendations. \n\n1. Memory Statement 1 aligns with the dialogue where Speaker A mentions watching and enjoying Pulp Fiction.\n2. Memory Statement 2 highlights Speaker B's role in recommending movies to Speaker A, which is useful for the language model to understand their dynamic.\n3. Memory Statement 3 provides additional context about Speaker B's movie preferences, which might relate to Speaker B mentioning watching \"Girl Next.\"\n4. Memory Statement 4 brings up Speaker A's inclination towards comedies, which aligns with their interest in \"Coming to America.\"\n5. Memory Statement 5 about Speaker B's past as a Film Studies teacher supports their credibility in giving movie recommendations.\n6. Memory Statement 6, while not directly mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, suggests a potential future conversation about the sequel to \"Coming to America,\" hinting at Speaker A's evolving movie interests.\n\nThe structured development of the memories could be improved to more explicitly connect with the conversation about \"Girl Next\" and Speaker A's inquiry about Speaker B's job influencing movie ideas. Overall, the information is relevant but could be refined for clearer connections to the current conversation."
