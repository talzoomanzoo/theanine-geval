Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet? Speaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n2. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n3. Speaker A is worried about gas mileage and asks about the fuel efficiency of Speaker B's car.\n4. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\n5. Speaker B received a new car from their mom and plans to drive during spring break.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "No, I've never been to Costa Rica but it sounds amazing! Make sure to pack lots of sunscreen and bug spray lol.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information that can be useful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 1 indicates that Speaker B is preparing for a trip, which ties into the context where they are discussing plane tickets. Sentence 2 shows the contrast between Speaker A's usual activities and Speaker B's current plans, adding depth to their exchange about travel. However, sentences 3, 5, and 4 are slightly less relevant as they focus more on the discussion about cars and road trips rather than directly addressing the current context of plane tickets and Costa Rica. Sentence 6 is about their shared sense of humor, which, while revealing about the speakers' personalities, does not directly contribute to the current context. Overall, while the MEMORY mentions aspects of travel contrasting with the present conversation on international travel, it doesn't fully enhance the understanding of the immediate interaction except for a few relevant parts."
