Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week? Speaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n2. Speaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII.\n3. Speaker B mentions that Resident Evil can be scary and provides some tips for playing it.\n4. Speaker B plays Resident Evil VIII alone in the dark to make it scarier.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy playing video games in their free time.\n6. Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I haven't played Resident Evil yet, but I did try out Jurassic Park: World again. It's always a fun time playing that game.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several relevant points that provide helpful context for generating a response. Specifically, Memory 2 mentions Speaker B's recent purchase of Resident Evil VIII, which aligns with Speaker B's comment about playing Resident Evil during the stormy weather. Memory 4 also highlights that Speaker B plays the game alone in the dark to enhance the experience, which could be relevant to the ongoing conversation. While Memories 1 and 6 suggest shared interests in gaming that might be less immediately relevant, they still form a context for the social interactions between Speaker A and B. Additionally, the sentences are structured in a way that clearly portrays the past interactions and interests of both speakers, making it easy for a language model to identify important contextual cues. The MEMORY nearly covers all aspects of connections, causality, and events shared by both speakers related to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
