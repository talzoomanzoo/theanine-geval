    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know.  Speaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like. Speaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too. Speaker B: Nice! Is anyone coming with you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n4. Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy.\n5. Speaker A is a guitar player and values jam time over social time.\n6. Speaker A frequents live band venues and plays music at home.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "No, I think I'll be flying solo for this one. Just me, my guitar, and some good bluegrass music. I'm looking forward to jamming out and soaking up the festival vibes.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provided includes multiple sentences that are relevant and helpful to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, Sentence 1 conveys that Speaker B's wife is pregnant, which is directly relevant to the offer of staying at a cabin and noting a more comfortable camping experience. Sentence 2 asserts that both speakers enjoy bluegrass music, which aligns with the context of potentially attending a Bluegrass show. Sentence 3 also ties to the context, as it anticipates discussions about logistics, presumably including the comfort level of Speaker B's wife. Sentence 4, though not directly mentioned in the dialogue, hints at potential emotions or reactions that can enrich Speaker A's future responses. However, Sentences 5 and 6, while giving a background on Speaker A's musical tendencies, are less immediately relevant to the specific context of attending a festival with Speaker B and their wife. \n\nOverall, most of the MEMORY provides helpful context for generating an appropriate response, but a couple of sentences could be seen as less directly connected to improving responses in the immediate dialogue context."
