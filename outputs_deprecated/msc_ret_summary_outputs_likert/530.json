Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together.\n3. Speaker B is unsure about what else there is to do in Alaska besides hiking.\n4. Speaker A mentions the outdoor activities they plan to do in Alaska, such as hiking.\n5. Speaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking.\n6. Speaker A has the impression that Alaska is cold and snowy, wondering if there are ski slopes there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I haven't looked into it much yet, but I'm excited to explore all the outdoor activities Alaska has to offer.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful information for generating a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It clearly outlines the current situation and past interactions: Speaker B's uncertainty about the Alaska trip (MEMORY points 1 and 3), Speaker A's knowledge about outdoor activities in Alaska (MEMORY points 4 and 5), and assumptions about the Alaskan climate (MEMORY point 6). This context supports Speaker B in continuing the conversation about trip planning, offering cues about potential interests or information gaps that Speaker A might address. However, the information that Speaker A is planning the trip with Speaker B (MEMORY point 2) is potentially inaccurate, as there's no evidence in the dialogue context supporting this, affecting the overall helpfulness slightly. Nevertheless, the MEMORY's coherent structure and clear connections between points compensate well."
