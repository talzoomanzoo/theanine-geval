Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play?  Speaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music. Speaker A: ah right, who's your favourite rock band? Speaker B: I'm big fan of aerosmith. When do you learn music. Whom teach you? Speaker A: aerosmith are great, have you ever seen them live? I have been playing drums since i was a kid, my father taught me when I was young and from then on I just taught myself Speaker B: That's awesome! I have been trying to learn last one year. Still I didn't get right teacher. I'm jealous on you. I don't have like your dad. Speaker A: what instrument have you been trying to learn?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is in a band and plays music, possibly a musician.\n2. Speaker B is willing to teach Speaker A how to fish and cook.\n3. Speaker A is in a band where they play the drums and write music, with 4 members including the singer who is their best friend.\n4.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provided has some useful information that could help generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, point 3 in the MEMORY, which mentions that Speaker A is in a band and plays the drums, aligns well with the context where Speaker A talks about playing drums since childhood. This connection can help to craft a response that draws on Speaker A's musical background.\n\nHowever, much of the MEMORY contains information that is not directly relevant to the current conversation about musical interests and learning instruments. For example, points 2, 4, and 5 introduce unrelated activities and preferences like fishing and seeing Sublime live. These details do not contribute directly to developing the current conversation context about learning and teaching instruments, Aerosmith, and growing up with musical influences.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY is adequately structured and provides some helpful cues, but some parts are not directly relevant, which limits its helpfulness in this specific dialogue."
