Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Marmalade.\n2. Speaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten.\n3. Speaker A has a kitten from their cat and enjoys taking them on trips.\n4. Speaker B is not a cat person but ends up taking care of stray cats brought home by kids.\n5. Speaker A usually leaves their cats with a friend while traveling.\n6. Speaker B loves dogs.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information that relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and are structured in a way that reflects the development of the conversation between the speakers. For instance, MEMORY sentences 1, 2, and 3 provide context about Speaker A's kitten, which is relevant to the decision about the kitten's name. These sentences also show a natural development from owning a cat to having a new kitten, which ties back to the naming decision mentioned in the dialogue context. Although MEMORY sentence 4 about Speaker B dealing with stray cats brought home by kids and sentence 6 about Speaker B loving dogs are not directly related to naming the kitten, they offer insights into Speaker B's perspective and relationship with animals, which could be relevant for future interactions. Sentence 5 is less directly connected but still pertains to Speaker A's relationship with their pets. Overall, the MEMORY provides helpful background that could facilitate generating a natural and coherent response in the context of the dialogue."
