Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n4. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n5. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B discussed the differences between Sweden and the US, including coffee breaks.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides detailed and relevant information that thoroughly supports the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about planning a trip to Sweden. It offers multiple points about both Speaker A and Speaker B's intentions, experiences, and opinions regarding Sweden. For instance, it addresses Speaker A's financial considerations and familial connections in Sweden, as well as Speaker B's long absence from the country due to expenses, and their fond memories. These elements are directly relevant and closely connected to the topic of planning a trip to Sweden. In addition, Speaker A and Speaker B's discussion about cultural differences between Sweden and the US adds depth to their interaction, aiding the generation of a nuanced and contextual response. The MEMORY is structured logically and clearly, making it easy for a language model to glean useful contextual cues. Overall, the MEMORY is helpful in providing grounding and context for generating a meaningful continuation in the dialogue."
