Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing? Speaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha! Speaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel.\n2. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans.\n3. Speaker A does not have any pets and expresses an interest in scuba diving.\n4. Speaker A is scared of sharks but finds the idea of going into a steel cage with them interesting.\n5. Speaker B prefers animals to humans but acknowledges the importance of curing diseases.\n6. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I love how unique and fascinating they are as pets. Their behavior and movements are so different from typical pets like dogs or cats. Plus, they're great conversation starters!",
    "prediction": "3\n\nThe MEMORY contains information that has some relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly sentence 1 about Speaker B having two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel, which directly relates to the ongoing discussion about the snakes. However, the rest of the MEMORY contains details that are not immediately connected to the current dialogue about snakes, such as Speaker A's interest in scuba diving, fears of sharks, volunteering at a lab, and future plans. Although these details are phrased in a way that is easy to understand, they do not provide additional helpful context for generating a response focused on snakes. Therefore, the helpfulness rating is in the middle, as the MEMORY provides some useful information but also includes unrelated content."
