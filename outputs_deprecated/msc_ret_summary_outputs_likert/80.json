Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me? Speaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week? Speaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day Speaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B found flights that work for their schedule and price and will be visiting Speaker A in a couple of weeks.\n2. Speaker A invited Speaker B to visit and mentioned looking into flights.\n3. Speaker A has invited Speaker B to visit them and is excited about the trip.\n4. Speaker A plans to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit.\n5. Speaker B is planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n6. Speaker A has visited Alaska and describes it as beautiful, suggesting cheap flights to Anchorage.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that can help a language model generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Several points in the MEMORY (points 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) directly relate to the current conversation about visiting and attending concerts, showing a progression in the speakers' past interactions regarding Speaker B's potential visit to Speaker A. This could be particularly helpful in anticipating Speaker A's next lines, possibly inquiring more about Speaker B's travel plans or suggesting concert options.\n\nThe MEMORY mentions Speaker B's interest in concerts and outdoor activities which aligns well with Speaker B's inquiry about concerts in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This suggests a continuity and a thematic coherence that would enable the language model to generate contextually appropriate and informed responses.\n\nHowever, point 6 seems somewhat unrelated to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as it discusses Speaker A's past travel unrelated to the present discussion of Speaker B's visit, which is more focused on the immediate context of their interaction. While naturally phrased, this point provides little benefit in generating responses related to their current topic of conversation.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides helpful context but could be improved by ensuring each point is tightly linked to the specific topics and progression of the current dialogue."
