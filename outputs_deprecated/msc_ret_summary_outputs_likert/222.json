Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods. Speaker B: Oh that sounds fun! What is it about? Speaker A: Black Widow is one of the character in the Marvel Avengers movies. Like Thor and Captain America. Have you seen any of those movies? Speaker B: No I haven't seen any of those. What foods did you eat while watching the movie? Speaker A: Wow, there are so many of the movies out there. Don't go see Black Widow without watching Avengers first. I had an amazing steak and vegetables on the side that were delicious. What is you favorite food? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and their brother enjoy going to a Brazilian steakhouse for dinner.\n2. Speaker A's brother enjoys Brazilian food, specifically steak.\n3. Speaker A plans to grab dinner with their brother before dancing.\n4. Speaker A enjoys salsa dancing and is planning to go out dancing.\n5. Speaker B expressed interest in trying healing methods mentioned by Speaker A.\n6. Speaker B works as a bartender and enjoys meeting different people.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm a big fan of trying new foods, but I think Brazilian steak sounds amazing! I'll have to give it a try sometime.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains some information that could potentially be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, notably points 1 and 2, which mention Speaker A's enjoyment of Brazilian steakhouse dinners and specific preference for steak. This aligns with the conversation about enjoying Brazilian foods, including steak, while watching the Black Widow movie. However, these connections are not strongly developed or structured to provide clear and helpful contextual cues for generating a next response. Points 3 to 6 do not relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about movies or Brazilian food and therefore do not enhance the ability of the language model to continue the conversation meaningfully. The overall MEMORY lacks development and coherence in linking to the current conversation, limiting its helpfulness."
