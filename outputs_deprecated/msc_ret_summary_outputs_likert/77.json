Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A invited Speaker B to visit and mentioned looking into flights.\n2. Speaker A has invited Speaker B to visit them and is excited about the trip.\n3. Speaker B found flights that work for their schedule and price and will be visiting Speaker A in a couple of weeks.\n4. Speaker A plans to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit.\n5. Speaker B is planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n6. Speaker B is interested in going whale watching and asks about a wolf petting zoo.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I found some flights that work for my schedule and budget. I'll be visiting you in a couple of weeks!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides detailed and relevant information regarding Speaker A and Speaker B's plans and interactions related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it mentions that Speaker A invited Speaker B to visit and Speaker B found suitable flights, which directly connect to the current topic of looking for tickets. Additionally, it highlights their mutual excitement about the trip and outlines specific activities they plan to do together, such as concerts and tours. These elements of MEMORY are naturally structured, give a clear development of events, and provide helpful background for generating a proper response in the context of planning the visit. The sentences are phrased in a way that allows the language model to easily identify the relevant contextual cues and discern any non-beneficial information."
