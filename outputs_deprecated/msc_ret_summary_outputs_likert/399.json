Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue. Speaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has devices to keep bugs away and offers to share the product names with Speaker B.\n2. Speaker A is looking forward to spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights.\n3. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy barbecuing and have a love for pets.\n5. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to meet up to discuss the furniture exchange.\n6. Speaker B plans to bring a new marinade and a six pack of beer for the gathering.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a fantastic idea! I'll definitely bring some bug spray to keep those pesky mosquitos away. And I'd be happy to help with your living room color scheme, I love decorating. Looking forward to our barbecue!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information that could assist the language model in generating a response that is aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, items 1, 3, 5, and 6 share relevant information related to the planned barbecue and meeting, closely connected to Speaker A's and Speaker B's interaction. Memory item 1 discusses Speaker A's knowledge about bug sprays, which is pertinent given Speaker B's comment about the bad mosquitos. Memory item 3 indicates an invitation for music and company, which ties in with Speaker A's intent to play guitar at the barbecue. Memory item 6 indicates Speaker B's intentions to bring a new marinade and beer, which could easily surface in future conversation about the barbecue. However, not all parts of the MEMORY contain necessary contextual cues or demonstrate a clear connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Memory items 2 and 4, while providing background on Speaker A's intentions and shared interests, do not directly inform the continuation of the current dialogue. The collection lacks some cohesiveness and development which would warrant a higher score, but it does contain pertinent points and is overall naturally structured."
