Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume. Speaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully.\n2. Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n3. Speaker A volunteers at a hospital and enjoys making origami crafts, specifically a 3D modular swan with glue.\n4. Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks.\n5. Speaker B is interested in making origami animals and finds the idea cute.\n6. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that Speaker A has a strong interest and skill in origami, which is relevant to the current dialogue about winning an origami contest. Sentences 1, 2, and 3 describe Speaker A's passion and experience in origami, helping to understand the importance of the accomplishment mentioned in the context. Sentence 4 notes a willingness to teach Speaker B, which shows a continued engagement with origami beyond the contest. Sentence 5 is slightly less relevant but demonstrates Speaker B's interest in origami, which aligns with their congratulatory response and enthusiasm. The only inconsistency is in Sentence 6, which suggests Speaker A is going to try the lotus origami next, conflicting with Sentence 1 where it's indicated that they have already successfully made it. Overall, the content is well-structured and mostly relevant, providing useful, connected context that informs Speaker A's dialogue generation."
