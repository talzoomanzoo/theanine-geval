Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice.  Speaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with? Speaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think? Speaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point. Speaker A: Yes, it contains eggs.  I think you would do well with the fried rice. It's best to cook the rice the day before.  \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work.\n2. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker.\n3. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n4. Speaker A primarily cooks Indian food and bakes a lot of rice dishes.\n5. Speaker A recommends the pressure cooker for its efficiency and ease of use, suggesting it to Speaker B.\n6. Speaker A has given a pressure cooker as a gift and uses it for recipes like lamb shanks.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great idea! I'll give the shrimp fried rice recipe a try, especially since we have fresh eggs from our own chickens. I'll make sure to cook the rice the day before. Thank you for the suggestion!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information in several ways. It establishes that Speaker B's husband enjoys Asian food and cooking, which aligns with the current dialogue's focus on Asian recipes. This confirms Speaker B's interest in trying out a new recipe involving Asian cuisine, implied in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY also highlights that Speaker B is not a cook but interested in learning more, which is evident from their curiosity about starting with fried rice. Additionally, the MEMORY provides background on Speaker A's expertise with pressure cookers and their experience with a variety of dishes, indicating credibility in their recommendation.\n\nHowever, not all details in the MEMORY are directly relevant to choosing the next dialogue response. For instance, the specifics about Speaker A primarily cooking Indian food and giving a pressure cooker as a gift, while informative, are not directly related to the dialogue's current focus on shrimp fried rice. The MEMORY is well-structured and presents relevant interaction history, but a slight improvement in directly connecting all MEMORY sentences to the current dialogue context would render it a perfect score."
