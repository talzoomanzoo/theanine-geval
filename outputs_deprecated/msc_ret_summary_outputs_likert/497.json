    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is in a band and plays music, possibly a musician.\n2. Speaker A is part of a band that tours different countries for their music.\n3. Speaker A is in a band where they play the drums and write music, with 4 members including the singer who is their best friend.\n4. Speaker A enjoys surfing and music as a way to escape from daily life.\n5. Speaker B is willing to teach Speaker A how to fish and cook.\n6. Speaker A enjoys eating fish, particularly salmon or tuna.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several pieces of information that can be helpful for Speaker B to generate a relevant response. Sentences 1, 2, and 3 are particularly useful as they establish that Speaker A is a musician, part of a band, and plays the drums, which directly connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B is asked about the instrument. This helps in generating context-aware responses. Sentence 4, 5, and 6 add depth to Speaker A's personality and interests (surfing, fishing, cooking), though not directly related to the current dialogue, they might be integrated naturally in conversation to build rapport or bring up a new discussion topic. Overall, the memory provides coherent and structured background that aids in continuing the dialogue, thus, granting it a high score."
