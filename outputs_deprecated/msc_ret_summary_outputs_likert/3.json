Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet? Speaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there? Speaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay? Speaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet\n2. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\n3. Speaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break.\n4. Speaker B received a new car from their mom and plans to drive during spring break.\n5. Speaker A is worried about gas mileage and asks about the fuel efficiency of Speaker B's car.\n6. Speaker A, a retired librarian, recommends the book \"Beautiful Ruins\" by Jess Walter for a beach visit.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking. I actually just finished reading \"Beautiful Ruins\" by Jess Walter. It's a great beach read if you're looking for something light and entertaining for your trip!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that could assist Speaker A in generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, point 1 indicates that Speaker B hasn't started packing for the trip, which is directly relevant to their conversation about the trip to Costa Rica. It can be a topic of interest when Speaker A responds. Additionally, point 2 provides context on Speaker A and B's differing spring break styles, which can help in engaging discussion. However, the remaining points (3-6) are not as connected to the current dialogueâ€”they offer additional context about Speaker B's excitement about spring break, the new car, and fuel efficiency, and a book recommendation, which do not directly aid in generating the next response in their present conversation about Costa Rica. Therefore, while some useful elements are present, there's room for improvement, warranting a middle-of-the-road score."
