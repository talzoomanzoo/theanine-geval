Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A mainly cares for dogs at the animal shelter, but also cats, and loves when new puppies are brought in.\n2. Speaker B is interested in volunteering and prefers cats over dogs, especially kittens.\n3. Speaker A loves animals, especially puppies, and visits shelters in every city they go to.\n4. Speaker A is busy with work and used to foster puppies but no longer does.\n5. Speaker B is a 26-year-old workaholic who is unsure about their career and doesn't have strong opinions on puppies.\n6. Speaker A dreams of meeting all the puppies from history when they can move through space and time.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I agree, puppies are just so adorable! I'm more of a cat person myself, especially kittens. Have you ever considered fostering kittens instead of puppies?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a significant amount of helpful information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context discusses a new cat at the shelter and compares its cuteness to puppies, implying a conversation around animals, specifically the dynamics between cats and dogs. The MEMORY provides relevant background information, such as Speaker A's focus on dogs (especially puppies) and general love for animals (points 1 and 3). It also mentions Speaker B's preference for cats (point 2), which directly connects to the mention of a new cat in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the details about Speaker B being a workaholic and unsure about their career (point 5) and Speaker A's dream about historical puppies (point 6) are less relevant to the current conversation. The sentences are well-structured and provide a clear picture of the speakers' backgrounds and interests, enhancing the language model's ability to generate an informed and contextually appropriate response."
