Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun! Speaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim.  Speaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\n2. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\n3. Speaker B is looking forward to eating a pizza burger in a pool with punk music playing.\n4. Speaker A knows how to swim since the age of 5.\n5. Speaker B does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies.\n6. Speaker A finds swimming relaxing and uses it to destress from their job.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY captures some relevant information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Information like Speaker B enjoying punk music and wanting to listen to it while participating in activities (swimming and programming) is useful because the context involves a playlist with punk music. Speaker A offering to teach swimming aligns with the context of them offering to teach Speaker B how to swim. However, details such as Speaker B's interest in burger pizza without direct connection to the context and information about Speaker A's swimming history from the age of 5 seem less immediately useful for crafting the next response. Also, the MEMORY could have been more focused on the context if the programming aspect and Speaker B's enthusiasm for learning to swim were better connected. Overall, while not without utility, the MEMORY could more effectively integrate and emphasize the context-relevant details."
