    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is looking forward to spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights.\n2. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n3. Speaker B suggests making enough barbeque for leftovers on nights when grilling is not possible, due to time or energy constraints.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy barbecuing and have a love for pets.\n5. Speaker B plans to bring a new marinade and a six pack of beer for the gathering.\n6. Speaker B plans to grill steaks this weekend and prefers using an old charcoal grill over a gas one.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds awesome! I'll definitely look forward to hearing you play. It'll add a nice touch to our evening of grilling and good company.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Several sentences are relevant to the context of the future barbecue mentioned by Speaker A, such as planning to enjoy evenings grilling, inviting Speaker B over for music and food, and suggesting making barbeque for leftovers. These sentences are naturally connected and offer contextual cues like enjoyment of barbecuing, preparations for the event, and preferences for grilling methods. The information is structured in a way that reflects the development of past interactions, such as shared interests and plans for the gathering, which can guide the language model in crafting a coherent response. However, some sentences, like the mutual love for pets, are less directly connected to the immediate context, which prevents a perfect score. Overall, the MEMORY effectively aids in setting the scene for the upcoming barbecue in the dialogue."
