Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on! Speaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar. Speaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes.\n2. Speaker A learned how to make jello from their grandma, turning it into a family tradition.\n3. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n4. Speaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners.\n5. Speaker A is eating their favorite jello.\n6. Speaker B also enjoys jello, with cherry being their favorite flavor as well.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Lay off desserts in general. I've been indulging a bit too much lately and need to cut back on the sugar intake.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker A's connection to jello and their grandmother, which aligns with the theme of family traditions discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It provides context about Speaker A's family tradition related to jello, which can be useful for Speaker B to relate to or build upon in the next response. The mention of cherry flavor as a favorite is useful if the conversation shifts towards specific preferences, which is mentioned in point 4 and 6, somewhat reinforcing a common ground. However, the information about Speaker A suggesting a surrogate grandma (point 3) does not directly relate to the dialogue context. Additionally, points about a favorite flavor (point 5) and implied current activity (point 6) could be constructed more cohesively to build a clearer narrative. While the memories are related, they lack a natural development or causality; some points are more isolated facts rather than directly connected past interactions relevant to this specific context."
