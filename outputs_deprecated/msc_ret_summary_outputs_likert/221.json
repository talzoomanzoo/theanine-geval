Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods. Speaker B: Oh that sounds fun! What is it about? Speaker A: Black Widow is one of the character in the Marvel Avengers movies. Like Thor and Captain America. Have you seen any of those movies? Speaker B: No I haven't seen any of those. What foods did you eat while watching the movie?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and their brother enjoy going to a Brazilian steakhouse for dinner.\n2. Speaker A's brother enjoys Brazilian food, specifically steak.\n3. Speaker A plans to grab dinner with their brother before dancing.\n4. Speaker A enjoys salsa dancing and is planning to go out dancing.\n5. Speaker B expressed interest in trying healing methods mentioned by Speaker A.\n6. Speaker B works as a bartender and enjoys meeting different people.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "We went to a Brazilian steakhouse for dinner before the movie. My brother loves Brazilian food, especially the steak. It's his favorite!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information that could help generate a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, the first two sentences in the MEMORY mention Speaker A's and their brother's interest in Brazilian food and steak, which aligns with the mention of having Brazilian foods in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the rest of the MEMORY doesn't provide a direct connection to the current conversation about the Black Widow movie or Marvel characters. The information about Speaker A's plans to go dancing, Speaker B's interest in healing methods, and Speaker B's occupation as a bartender doesn't seem relevant to the ongoing dialogue about movies and food. While the MEMORY lacks focus and clarity regarding the current discussion about movies and foods, the relevant parts are phrased in a way that the language model can identify. Therefore, it's somewhat helpful but could be much more useful if it better aligned its irrelevant sentences to the ongoing topics."
