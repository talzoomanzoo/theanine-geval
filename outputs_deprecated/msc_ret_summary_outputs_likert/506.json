Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play?  Speaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music.

    "raw_prediction": "You should definitely give it a try! Surfing is such a fun and exhilarating experience, it's a great way to escape from the daily grind. You could always check out some surf shops in your area for lessons, they might even have group lessons you can join.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some information that could be useful for Speaker A's next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically the parts about surfing and Speaker A's background. For example, memory 1 is relevant because it touches on Speaker B's interest in surfing, which is a topic in the dialogue context. Additionally, memories 5 and 6 about Speaker A's surfing skills and background could help in forming a more personalized response. However, the details about fishing (memories 2 and 4) and the general note about Speaker A enjoying surfing and music as an escape (memory 3) are not directly relevant to the current dialogue context. The information doesn't connect well or follow a clear development path relevant to the conversation, which is why the score isn't higher. The MEMORY contains relevant sentences, but not all sentences are directly linked to the current conversation, and some could be structured better to show clear relevance and development in the interaction history."
