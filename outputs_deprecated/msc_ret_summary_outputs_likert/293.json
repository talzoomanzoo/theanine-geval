Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week? Speaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you? Speaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n2. Speaker B mentions that Resident Evil can be scary and provides some tips for playing it.\n3. Speaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII.\n4. Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World.\n5. Speaker B plays Resident Evil VIII alone in the dark to make it scarier.\n6. Speaker A prefers tamer video games and is not a fan of horror movies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "How about trying out something like Jurassic Park: World? It's a fun game with a different vibe compared to Resident Evil. Plus, it's always nice to mix things up and try something new!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information that is helpful for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains details about Speaker A's and Speaker B's gaming preferences and their past interactions concerning video games, specifically with Resident Evil. For instance, it mentions that Speaker A is hesitant about playing Resident Evil and prefers tamer games, while Speaker B enjoys horror aspects and offers tips, which can guide the conversation on game recommendations. However, there is some potential repetition or redundancy regarding Speaker A's preferences and Speaker B's gaming habits that don't explicitly add additional context to the current dialogue. Overall, the MEMORY is structured in a coherent way that indicates speakers' past interactions and relates to the current topic of discussion, making it quite helpful."
