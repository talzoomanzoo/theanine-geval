Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place? Speaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping? Speaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp? Speaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer? Speaker A: I've only camped in a tent so far, but would like to try out a camper trailer. What do use for camping?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B expresses concern about leaving a kitten alone during their family camping adventures.\n2. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n3. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n4. Speaker A is offering advice and seems to have experience with children.\n5. Speaker B just moved to America and is unfamiliar with the places.\n6. Speaker B is interested in finding family discounts for the zoo.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains a mixture of relevant and less relevant information with respect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Some sentences are helpful in offering contextual cues, while others are not. Here's the breakdown:\n\n- Helpful aspects:\n  1. Sentence 1 about Speaker B's concern for their kitten is relevant as it provides context about their family-oriented trips and camping experiences, which could influence future responses about family trips or camping adventures.\n  2. Sentence 2 highlights Speaker B's involvement as a parent in school activities, which aligns with the context discussing family outings and activities. \n\n- Less helpful aspects:\n  1. Sentences 3, 4, 5, and 6 don't provide immediate relevance to the current context of camping and methods of camping. These sentences talk more about Speaker A's background and some more generalized interests/discomforts of Speaker B. They could be useful in a broader conversation but don't directly impact the current camping-focused dialogue.\n\nIn summary, some sentences are helpful, but the overall connectivity and immediate relevance to the topic of camping and camping preferences could be improved for a higher score."
