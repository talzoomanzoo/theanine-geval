Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her?

Do you have any plans to go back to Italy in the future? Speaker B: I would love to get back to Italy but need to save up and the hopeful priority is to Greece this year.  You have friends in Europe are you in contact to see what plans you can make?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology.\n2.

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I've been in touch with my friends in Europe and we are planning to meet up in Italy during my trip. It will be great to explore together and catch up.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides useful background information on Speaker A and Speaker B that could aid in generating a relevant response. Key points such as Speaker B's interest in visiting Greece (1), their involvement in Greek mythology (5), and previous enjoyment of Italy (4) provide context for why they might be interested in traveling and studying mythology. This is directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B discusses plans related to Greece and interest in Greek mythology. Additionally, knowledge of Speaker A’s planned trip to Italy (2) and their interest in architecture (3) aligns with the dialogue discussion about Speaker A’s upcoming Italy trip and could steer conversation topics in interesting directions. \n\nWhile some details such as Speaker A buying a dress (6) or enjoying documentaries (3) are not immediately pertinent to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, they are naturally structured sentences that could be useful for context in future interactions. Overall, MEMORY is connected well to the context and offers helpful insights, warranting a score of 4."
