Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well? Speaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes? Speaker A: I want to take some martial art classes at school next year. What do you sggest I try? Speaker B: I mean I always recommend Karate since that's what I study! I can bring you by the dojo sometime if you want to see what it is like.  Speaker A: OMG!! That would be so awesome, Yes please.  When is a good time for you? Speaker B: Awesome! Tomorrow afternoon anytime between 3-6 would work for me! Speaker A: Perfect.

I'm working this weekend if you want to come when I am working. Where do you want to eat? Speaker A: I defiantly will. As well a bucket of sunscreen, safety in the sun first.  I was thinking that new sandwhich shop by the collage that just opened, what do nyou think? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B practices karate and works as a lifeguard but is looking for a different career.\n2. Speaker B signed up for classes at the local college and has a background in football and karate.\n3. Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work.\n4. Speaker A is studying marketing and enjoys it.\n5. Speaker B attends football games at their old high school and finds that their football background helps in karate footwork.\n6.

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a plan! I've been wanting to try that new sandwich shop too. Can't wait for our karate session tomorrow and lunch afterwards!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it could be more relevant. The fact that Speaker B practices karate is clearly relevant, as it comes up in the dialogue, and knowing that Speaker B holds a green belt could be beneficial for understanding their level of expertise. Additionally, Speaker B being a lifeguard is also relevant since they offer to bring guest passes to the pool in the dialogue. However, other pieces of information, like Speaker B's consideration of a career change or their background in football, don't add much value to this specific interaction about martial arts and the upcoming dojo visit. The MEMORY also mentions Speaker A's field of study, but this isn't touched upon in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, while some parts of the MEMORY align with the dialogue, it includes extra details that are not immediately useful, and the connection between sentences could be improved to enhance clarity and coherence."
