Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on! Speaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar. Speaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general? Speaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts. Speaker A: How's learning to bake going in general, especially now that you're off desserts? Speaker B: I one of those people how have to fail a couple of times before I get the hang of it, but I'm getting there.  Have you and the kids had any chance to go skiing lately?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A learned how to make jello from their grandma, turning it into a family tradition.\n2. Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes.\n3. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n4. Speaker B does not do a lot of cooking or baking but is interested in learning.\n5. Speaker B is excited to join Speaker A's family for a water skiing trip and wants to learn from Speaker A's kids.\n6. Speaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "We haven't been skiing recently, but we're planning a trip soon. And I can definitely teach you some jello recipes when we get together!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information for generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker A's connection to jello through their grandmother (Memory 1 and 6), which connects to Speaker B's interest in family traditions and passing on recipes (as mentioned in the context). Memory 4 about Speaker B's interest in learning cooking aligns with the ongoing conversation about baking and cooking. However, some sentences, like Memory 5 about water skiing, are not directly relevant to the immediate conversation about baking and family recipes. While the memories are related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, not all sentences are naturally structured to show the development of past interactions. The score reflects this partial helpfulness."
