Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company? Do you build computers or work on programming? Speaker B: I do like my job. My job is to troubleshoot issues between the hardware and software, so I get to work with both. Speaker A: That sounds interesting. That's great that you love your job, not many people do.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys reading books about ice cream, Disney World, and computers.\n2. Speaker B works for a computer company and is unable to change careers until their child graduates.\n3. Speaker A works for a small local business with a demanding schedule.\n4. Speaker A is considering a career in dentistry but is also interested in working at Disney for happiness.\n5. Speaker B's mother is a dentist and loves her job.\n6. Speaker A considers quitting their job to work at Disney World.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information that could be beneficial for generating a proper response. Specifically, statement 2 directly relates to Speaker B's job at a computer company, which fits with the context where Speaker B discusses their job. Additionally, statement 5 mentions Speaker B's mother's career, which could tie into future discussions if careers and jobs become a topic of conversation. However, statements about Speaker A's interests, other career considerations, and their current job do not directly contribute to the current dialogue context. While they offer potential future conversation paths, they are less relevant to the immediate context. Overall, the MEMORY provides some helpful cues, but many sentences do not strongly develop the current dialogue context, resulting in a mid-range score."
