Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know.  Speaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n2. Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n4. Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy.\n5. Speaker A frequents live band venues and plays music at home.\n6. Speaker B agrees to look at Speaker A's Subaru Legacy for the funny noise it makes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's so thoughtful of you and your friend! We would really appreciate the offer to stay at the cabin. Thank you so much for arranging that for us.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several pieces of helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The fact that Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music (Memory 1) and that Speaker B's wife is pregnant (Memory 2) directly relate to the conversation about the Bluegrass show and possibly looking for more comfortable accommodations. Memory 3 and 4 provide additional context about the challenges Speaker B faces due to pregnancy and hint at a dynamic where Speaker B feels a bit envious of Speaker A's freedom, which adds depth to their interactions. Memory 5, while not directly related is phrased naturally and provides understanding of Speaker A's involvement in music which justifies their interest in the Bluegrass show. Memory 6, though unrelated to the immediate dialogue context, is structured in a way that clearly distinguishes it as separate from the current topic. The overall structure allows easy identification of relevant information useful for generating a response."
