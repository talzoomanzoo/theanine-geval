Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens? Speaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month Speaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.  Where are you going on vacation? Speaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there! Speaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo.\n2. Speaker A has been to the zoo before and enjoys seeing exotic birds.\n3. Speaker B's girlfriend enjoys pandas and penguins at the zoo, and they go to the zoo every few weeks.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss hobbies and interests, with Speaker A enjoying gardening and reading, and Speaker B enjoying visiting the zoo.\n5. Speaker A enjoys seeing pandas and penguins at the zoo and goes with their sister.\n6. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains several pieces of information that are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically relating to Speaker B's interest in visiting the zoo and considering adopting a kitten. However, the MEMORY also includes extraneous details that are not directly relevant to the current conversation, such as Speaker A's hobbies and their enjoyment of pandas and penguins.\n\nThe helpful elements are:\n1. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend, aligning with their current decision-making process discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n2. Speaker B enjoys visiting the zoo, which connects to their excitement about visiting the San Diego Zoo on vacation.\n\nThe less helpful elements include:\n1. Speaker A's past experience at the zoo, which is not directly relevant to the current dialogue.\n2. The specifics about Speaker B's girlfriend's preferences and their frequency of zoo visits, which do not significantly impact the current conversation.\n\nOverall, while there is some helpful and connected information, the MEMORY could be more concise and directly focused on elements that would aid in generating a response related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
