Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it! Speaker B: I'm glad you liked it. My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to? Speaker A: I recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca. It was super cute and made me want to go visit Italy, but that was too expensive, so instead I booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month. What about you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A has seen the Disney movie 'Luca' recently.\n2. Speaker B's kids enjoyed watching 'Luca' and said it was good.\n3. Speaker B's kids enjoy watching Disney movies, which Speaker B also finds good.\n4. Speaker B's husband enjoys Disney sports movies, such as 'Miracle'.\n5. Speaker B enjoys watching movies with her kids.\n6. Speaker B recommends Speaker A to watch 'Miracle'.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a fun trip to Hawaii! I'm sure you'll have an amazing time. As for me, we've been watching a lot of Disney movies lately. Maybe we should plan a movie night together soon!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided offers some relevant information about the past interactions between the speakers, particularly regarding their preferences for Disney movies. The MEMORY mentions that Speaker A has recently seen the movie 'Luca' (relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT), which Speaker B's kids have also enjoyed. Additionally, it highlights that Speaker B's husband enjoys Disney sports movies like 'Miracle', which is relevant to the beginning of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A mentions watching 'Miracle'. However, not all sentences in MEMORY are directly helpful or structured in a natural way to assist in generating the next response. For instance, the sentence \"Speaker B recommends Speaker A to watch 'Miracle'\" is somewhat redundant as it was already established in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, the MEMORY provides reasonable contextual cues, but not all sentences are clearly connected or essential to enhance the continuity of the dialogue."
