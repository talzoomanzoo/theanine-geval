Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it. Speaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it. Speaker A: Cool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot. What is your favorite part about camping?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat.\n2. Speaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout.\n3. Speaker B is busy with scouts, school, work, and tennis, but willing to take vacation days for the retreat.\n4. Speaker A is involved in church activities and mentioned a church retreat\n5. Speaker B is a member of the boy scouts and works at a fast food place\n6. Speaker A suggested that Speaker B join one of the church retreats in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "My favorite part about camping is being out in nature and disconnecting from all the distractions of daily life. It's really peaceful and refreshing. Plus, it's always fun to challenge yourself and learn new skills in the great outdoors.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information that could be helpful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it mentions Speaker B's extensive involvement with the Boy Scouts, which aligns with the current discussion about scouting and camping. However, most of the MEMORY focuses on Speaker A's involvement in church activities and their interactions with Speaker B regarding a retreat, which is somewhat related but not directly connected to the current dialogue about camping and survival skills. The memory could have been more helpful if it included specific experiences or knowledge Speaker B has gained through scouting, which would directly assist in answering Speaker A's current question about camping. While the memory is relevant, it is not sufficiently detailed or directly connected to the dialogue context to achieve a higher score."
