Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes.  Speaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me. Speaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house.  Speaker B: Understandable. Have you ever tried contacting animal control? That's how I got Bandicoot. I was working that day and animal control came by explaining about needing fosters for raccoons. I thought it was weird, so I did it and began to work at the small raccoon cafe that is part of the zoo. I love it.  Speaker A: That is a good idea.  Maybe they could help move them to a safer area.  I have a lot of traffic around and they could get hit if they are coming to my place all the time.  Have you been able to teach your raccoon any tricks? Speaker B: The only trick I was able to teach him, that I deeply regret, was how locks worked. I thought it was cool at first, you know, to see a raccoon unlock a door. And now, I regret it so much. I've had to change the layout of my apartment and put deadbolts on my doors so that Bandicoot can't get out. And, he is sneaky about it. One time, he unlocked the pantry and was eating some cookies! It's like having a toddler that never grows up.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B works at a Raccoon Cafe and takes care of Bandicoot, a raccoon.\n2. Speaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n3. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly.\n4. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n5. Speaker B considers raccoons intelligent and funny.\n6. Speaker A has not interacted closely with raccoons but admires them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is not as fully developed or naturally connected as it could be. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. Sentence 1 is helpful as it establishes Speaker B's connection to raccoons and reinforces the background context of the current conversation regarding raccoons.\n\n2. Sentence 2 touches on Speaker B's interest in training raccoons, which might relate to the last part of the dialogue where Speaker A asks if Speaker B has taught any tricks to Bandicoot.\n\n3. Sentence 3 provides a general belief of Speaker B that raccoons can be good pets, which could be relevant in forming a response to Speaker A's concerns about raccoons and diseases.\n\n4. Sentence 4 directly addresses Speaker A’s plan discussed in the dialogue, but the mention of buying is not accurately aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as Speaker A has already acquired the aluminum sheeting.\n\n5. Sentence 5 reinforces Speaker B’s perspective on raccoons’ intelligence, which is helpful given the conversation revolves around raccoons’ smartness and Bandicoot’s tricks.\n\n6. Sentence 6 refers to Speaker A's view on raccoons, which adds some context but does not significantly aid the immediate conversational flow or next response generation.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful, but the connections between the various elements could be more naturally and explicitly drawn to aid in the generation of a coherent and contextually relevant response."
