Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work.\n2. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n3. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker.\n4. Speaker A has given a pressure cooker as a gift and uses it for recipes like lamb shanks.\n5. Speaker A recommends the pressure cooker for its efficiency and ease of use, suggesting it to Speaker B.\n6. Speaker A primarily cooks Indian food and bakes a lot of rice dishes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! I'm excited to give it a try. Do you have any specific recipes you recommend starting with?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY is quite relevant and helpful for generating a suitable response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It provides clear information about both speakers' interests and preferences regarding cooking. Specifically, it clarifies that Speaker B's husband enjoys preparing Asian food (memory 1), which could be directly relevant to considering the recipes Speaker A found. Additionally, it mentions Speaker A's familiarity and expertise with using pressure cookers (memories 2, 4, 5), which supports the recommendation of pressure cookers in the dialogue. Furthermore, memory 3 indicates Speaker B's interest in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker, which aligns well with Speaker A's suggestions. These connections demonstrate a clear development and understanding of past interactions between the speakers. The only slight issue is that not all memories are directly related to the Asian food focus or the efficacy of using a pressure cooker, which prevents a perfect score. However, the memory is structured in a way that provides helpful contextual cues, making it easy for a language model to generate an informed and relevant response."
