Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it? Speaker B: Yes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see.  Speaker A: I definitely will, this sounds like such an amazing trip. How long has it been since you've been there yourself? Speaker B: I was in Greece last two years ago.   I am excited to go again soon!    At somepoint I would like to take a cruise around the islands there.  It seems like a neat way to see all the Islands in an easy way.   Have you ever taken a cruise? Speaker A: Only once before when I was very young, so I don't remember much. It sounds like such a relaxing way to enjoy the day, though. Maybe we can plan a cruise together sometime. Speaker B: That would be fun!  I go to Europe a lot so maybe a cruise in the Caribbean would be nice.  I would like to see Saint Lucia and Saint Thomas.  Speaker A: Oh, Europe? I'm already sold on the idea, sounds like a blast! I've never had a negative experience in Europe. Should we visit some of the capital cities?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five.\n2. Speaker A has traveled around Europe before, visiting capital cities of each country.\n3. Speaker B and their kids are excited about their upcoming trip to Greece.\n4. Speaker B recommends visiting the Parthenon, Acropolis of Athens, and the beach on Corfu Island in Greece.\n5. Speaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian.\n6. Speaker A's favorite cities from the trip were Rome, Berlin, Madrid, and Helsinki.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely! Visiting the capital cities is always a great idea. Each one has its own unique charm and history to explore. I can recommend some must-visit cities based on my own experiences if you'd like.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a moderate level of helpfulness for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. There are several relevant points that could be useful for Speaker B's responses:\n\n1. \"Speaker B recommends visiting the Parthenon, Acropolis of Athens, and the beach on Corfu Island in Greece.\" - This is relevant as it aligns with the current conversation about the Acropolis and further suggests Speaker B's interest in Greece.\n\n2. \"Speaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian.\" - This statement provides a context of Speaker B's enthusiasm and interest, although it contradicts the dialogue context where Speaker B has been to Greece two years ago. \n\n3. \"Speaker A has traveled around Europe before, visiting capital cities of each country.\" - This connects with the dialogue about planning a cruise and not having a negative experience in Europe, although it lacks the detail about cruising that they discussed. \n\nThe MEMORY contains factual inconsistencies and some statements (\"Speaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time\") that contradict the DIALOGUE CONTEXT (\"I was in Greece last two years ago\"). Despite this, the memory overall still gives a reasonable amount of helpful information which is somewhat connected and well-structured, but it isn't optimal due to these inconsistencies and the lack of relevant cues about their cruise plans or Speaker B's travel frequency to Europe."
