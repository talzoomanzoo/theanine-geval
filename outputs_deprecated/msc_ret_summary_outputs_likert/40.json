Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well? Speaker B: I haven't! Just karate!

I'm working this weekend if you want to come when I am working. Where do you want to eat?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B practices karate and works as a lifeguard but is looking for a different career.\n2.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information that could be helpful to the language model for generating the next response in the context of the conversation. For example, the memory mentions Speaker B's involvement in karate and their intention to bring guest passes to the pool, which aligns with the conversation about going to the dojo and lifeguarding. However, many details provided in MEMORY do not have a direct connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A's studies in marketing or both speakers' interest in learning new languages. While these pieces of information are phrased well and coherently, they do not specifically contribute to the progression or development of the particular conversation about martial arts classes or meeting at the dojo. Thus, it gets a mid-range score as it provides a mix of useful and extraneous information."
