Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast. Speaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project. Speaker A: Quite a few, but it wasn't too crowded. It was a nice change of scenery. What kind of project are you working on? Speaker B: I'm sure the student appreciate that. You teach as a group as apposed to one-on-one right?

Speaker A: It's been a little stressful lately, because finals are coming up...but I'm confident in that class. I could've aced it before I even started! I'll definitely get started with you after finals. Speaker B: Ahaha we;; for someone who's so passionate about martial arts I'm not surprised. Great, I'll try to be the best student I can. I'm starving, think I should grab some take-out from Sufi? Speaker A: Of course! It's your favorite after all! Now you made me hungry! lol\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class and enjoys it.\n2. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts.\n3.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided offers relevant information about Speaker A and Speaker B's interests and activities, which align well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY clearly states that Speaker A is involved in martial arts, both as a teacher and student, and is taking a class on the history of martial arts, which aligns with the ongoing conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Similarly, it provides insight into Speaker B's software work and recent interest in an online class about martial arts history. These connections to the context make the MEMORY quite helpful for a language model to generate a coherent response. However, readings like Speaker A planning to take summer courses and their major in athletic training are less directly relevant to the specific dialogue at hand, although they still contribute to a fuller understanding of the characters. The passages are subtly interconnected, aligning well with the conversational themes while maintaining clarity, thus meriting a high score."
