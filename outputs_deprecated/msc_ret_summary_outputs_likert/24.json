Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok?  Speaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish? Speaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit.\n2. Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule.\n3. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n4. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy.\n5. Speaker B loves the beach and Mediterranean food.\n6. Speaker A is an omnivore.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds amazing! Chicken parmesan is one of my favorites too. I bet it tastes even better because it's free. Can't wait to see the pic!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information that provide a useful backdrop for the interaction. Sentences 1 and 3 are particularly helpful as they directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. They mention that Speaker A works at a restaurant, which is relevant because the conversation revolves around a dish being added to the menu at Speaker A's workplace. Additionally, sentence 3 also explains why Speaker A would be excited about trying the dish for free, as it mentions they get two free meals per week. Sentence 2 and 4 reaffirm Speaker A's restaurant work, although they do not add much more than what's already conveyed in sentence 1. However, sentences 5 and 6 do not clearly relate to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT and do not assist in generating a relevant response for this specific interaction. Overall, the MEMORY provides some helpful details, but there is room for improvement in connecting all sentences to the current context."
