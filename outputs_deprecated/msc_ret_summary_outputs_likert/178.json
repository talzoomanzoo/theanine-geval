Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you? Speaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses. Speaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set? Speaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up. Speaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\n2. Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them.\n3. Speaker B's father was involved in producing horror movies, which influenced Speaker B's favorite genre.\n4. Speaker A also likes mid-century design and is a fan of horror movies.\n5. Speaker A prefers classic horror movies like Halloween or Friday the 13th over modern ones.\n6. Speaker B has a government job that pays the bills but wishes they could work in interior design.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Movie blood is typically made from a mixture of ingredients like corn syrup, food coloring, and sometimes even chocolate syrup or coffee grounds for texture. My favorite recipe involves using corn syrup as a base with red and blue food coloring to achieve a realistic look. It's pretty fun experimenting with different combinations to get the perfect consistency and color for each scene.",
    "prediction": "3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information that could be helpful for Speaker B to generate a response. For example, it mentions that Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad and that their father influenced their favorite genre, which could be relevant to the conversation about making movies. However, there are several points that seem misaligned or not very helpful, such as confusion between Speaker A and B regarding which speaker has the passion for producing horror movies, and the mention of interior design, which Speaker B indicated was not a good fit for them. The MEMORY contains some connections and relevant details but is not entirely consistent or connected, which affects its overall helpfulness."
