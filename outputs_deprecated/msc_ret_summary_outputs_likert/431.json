Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\n3. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n4. Speaker A is looking for a job and new camping gear, specifically a hammock.\n5. Speaker A will use the money earned from the store to buy the hammock online.\n6. Speaker A plans to bring sandwiches and fruit for the hike, specifically asking about veggie sandwiches for Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains several pieces of information that are relevant and helpful for generating Speaker B's next response. Firstly, it notes Speaker A’s job application to the grocery store, which directly corresponds to the context of the job offer mentioned in DIALOGUE CONTEXT (Sentence 1). Additionally, Sentence 5 establishes why the job is important for Speaker A (to buy a hammock), providing a reason for their excitement or need for the job, allowing Speaker B to respond accordingly.\n\nMoreover, the MEMORY also contextualizes Speaker A’s situation and personal attributes (recent high school graduate, shy, on a cross-country journey), which can be valuable in crafting a supportive or empathetic response from Speaker B (Sentence 3). \n\nSentences 2 and 6 are not directly related to the context but are phrased in a way that is naturally integrated into the MEMORY. Sentence 4 provides background on Speaker A's current job search and interest, which aligns with the context of receiving a job offer.\n\nOverall, the connections and context provided are coherent and maintain relevance, although Sentence 6 is less immediately relevant. However, the interconnectedness and natural flow of the MEMORY allow a language model to discern important contextual cues effectively, resulting in a high score of 4."
