Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like. Speaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is an artist who walks through nature for work.\n2. Speaker B lives in the country, loves nature, and works with animals.\n3. Speaker A is a city dweller who walks to work instead of driving.\n4. Speaker A asks about Speaker B's new artwork and acknowledges their need for inspiration.\n5. Speaker B enjoys reading the Odd Thomas and Dark Tower series and finds inspiration for their artwork during nature walks.\n6. Speaker A enjoys reading sci-fi and mysteries, while Speaker B prefers fantasy books.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I went to a nearby park with a beautiful trail that goes through the forest. The trees and wildlife were so inspiring, just like your artwork.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains several points of information that are relevant and helpful for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, points 1, 2, and 5 provide useful context that Speaker A might consider when responding, such as Speaker B's interest in nature, their profession as an artist, and their habit of drawing inspiration from nature walks. This could suggest that Speaker A might choose to elaborate on how the nature walk might inspire Speaker B's art, or they could refer to specific details about the landscape that Speaker B might find interesting for their artwork. The MEMORY entries are well-structured and reveal the relationship and points of interest between the two speakers. \n\nHowever, some entries, like 3 and 6, while informative, are less directly applicable to the immediate context of Speaker A's response about the nature walk, hence the score of 4 instead of 5. These entries are still naturally phrased, and the language model can easily discern their relevance. Overall, the MEMORY provides a solid contextual background that helps form a cohesive understanding of the speakers' interaction history and interests."
