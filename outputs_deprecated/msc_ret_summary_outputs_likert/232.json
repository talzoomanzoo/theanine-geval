Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you. Speaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them Speaker A: IN MY HOME?! A TREE? That was not at all what I was thinking. Do they grow well indoors? I am intrigued.  Speaker B: Well if you want to make it like a proper garden experience then I would suggest going all in, and go for the best most authentic looking items you could get \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing.\n2. Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden.\n3. Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more.\n4. Speaker A jokes about space weeds and expresses a desire to see space.\n5. Speaker A plays the clarinet in a band concert and has a solar investment for their office building.\n6. Speaker B is also interested in space exploration and plant science, expressing concerns about the fuels used for space travel.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I never thought about having a tree indoors, but it could definitely add a unique touch to my garden project. Thanks for the suggestion, I'll look into it!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information about both speakers, but not all are directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, some points are valuable for generating a proper next response. For example, MEMORY point 1 highlights Speaker A's struggle with gardening, aligning with the current dialogue where Speaker A seeks gardening advice. Point 2 establishes Speaker B's knowledge in gardening, which is relevant since Speaker A is looking for suggestions. However, points 3, 5, and 6 about weight gain, band concert, solar investment, and space exploration, while interesting, do not connect meaningfully to the current conversation about making a garden indoors. The MEMORY does manage to give a sense of both speakers' personalities and interests but could be better aligned or more focused on the specific dialogue context. Overall, the MEMORY is moderately helpful in informing potential responses but includes extraneous information."
