Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies! Speaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?   Speaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere! Speaker B: You have a point.  It is nice to see puppies wagging their tail and just following you!  Changing topics, do you have any recipes with asparagus?  You know, it's such a popular vegetable, but I just don't know how to prepare it. Speaker A: I don't have recipes but I know how to make a good grilled asparagus. Are you looking to bolster your chef book?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys grilling indoors and suggests grilled asparagus with lemon on it.\n2. Speaker B is interested in trying different careers and is considering becoming a chef for Speaker A who loves Mexican food and seafood.\n3. Speaker A enjoys cooking, especially making fajitas, and also volunteers at animal shelters.\n4. Speaker A mainly cares for dogs at the animal shelter, but also cats, and loves when new puppies are brought in.\n5. Speaker A loves animals, especially puppies, and visits shelters in every city they go to.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B are excited about the idea of traveling the world and trying different cuisines.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Definitely! I think learning how to grill asparagus would be a great addition to my cooking skills. Plus, it sounds delicious with lemon on top. Maybe I can even try making it for you sometime!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several sentences that provide relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, sentences 1, 3, and 4 are directly related to the conversation, as they give insight into Speaker A's knowledge and preferences regarding cooking and animals, including their love for puppies and experience with cooking, such as grilled asparagus. Sentence 2 introduces a topic about Speaker B's career interests, which, although not directly related, adds depth to their persona and could be relevant for future conversations. Sentences 5 and 6 offer additional context about Speaker A's passion for animals and shared interests with Speaker B, which contributes to understanding the relationship between the speakers. Overall, the MEMORY is well-structured, with naturally connected sentences, allowing the language model to generate relevant and informed responses in continuation of the dialogue."
