Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods. Speaker B: Oh that sounds fun! What is it about? Speaker A: Black Widow is one of the character in the Marvel Avengers movies. Like Thor and Captain America. Have you seen any of those movies? Speaker B: No I haven't seen any of those. What foods did you eat while watching the movie? Speaker A: Wow, there are so many of the movies out there. Don't go see Black Widow without watching Avengers first. I had an amazing steak and vegetables on the side that were delicious. What is you favorite food?  Speaker B: Oh ok I definitely will watch those first! I love both steak and vegetables! I am a real foodie and love just about everything that isn't too strange to try lol. Speaker A: Oh wow! Do you like sushi? I love it but the sea urchin is a little crazy lol. Have you ever eaten sea urchin? Speaker B: I have never tried sea urchin or sushi but I do like crab legs and shrimp! Do you ever consider any foods to be good for healing? I find that you do healing very fascinating! Speaker A: Yes, in fact I consider almost all foods to either be healing, harmful or neutral. In my opinion people should choose foods based on how they want to feel. Sushi is fresh and healthy so I considerate it to be very healing. Speaker B: That is very wise thinking. Which vegetables do you feel are the best for healing? Are there any that should be avoided? Speaker A: I feel that most leafy green vegetables are healthy, but it depends on the specific person's needs. For example some people need to avoid nightshades, like potatoes, etc. while other people can eat them without any problems. Overall, a diet with a variety of colors is good when it comes to vegetables\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B expressed interest in trying healing methods mentioned by Speaker A.\n2. Speaker A recommended self-massage, essential oils, reiki, meditation, and self-awareness for healing.\n3. Speaker A is involved in healing work and mentioned hot latina salsa.\n4. Speaker A's brother enjoys Brazilian food, specifically steak.\n5. Speaker A and their brother enjoy going to a Brazilian steakhouse for dinner.\n6. Speaker A is a Reiki practitioner who also works with meditation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's really interesting! I'll definitely keep that in mind when choosing what to eat. I'll have to try incorporating more colorful vegetables into my diet. Thank you for the advice!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provided contains some helpful information that connects with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. In the conversation, both speakers discuss food preferences and the concept of healing through food, and the memory indicates that Speaker A is involved in healing work and practices Reiki and meditation, which can be relevant to the ongoing conversation about food and healing (e.g., MEMORY points 2, 3, and 6). However, there is limited direct connection or causal development between the MEMORY and the specific details being discussed in the current dialogue. For example, MEMORY points 4 and 5 mention Brazilian steak, which ties to Speaker A's mention of enjoying Brazilian food, but there is no further development or contextual linkage to Speaker B's interest in healing foods. Additionally, while MEMORY point 1 aligns with the theme of healing, it lacks specificity related to the current discussion of healing foods. The MEMORY does provide some context that could guide the development of the dialogue, but it lacks the ideal clarity and direct relevance needed for a higher rating."
