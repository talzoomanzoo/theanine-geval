Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast. Speaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project. Speaker A: Quite a few, but it wasn't too crowded. It was a nice change of scenery. What kind of project are you working on? Speaker B: I'm sure the student appreciate that. You teach as a group as apposed to one-on-one right? And one of the companies I work for had their system hit with a virus so I've been upgraded their software to debug the system.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts.\n2. Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class and enjoys it.\n3. Speaker A is planning to take summer courses soon and is very active, enjoying martial arts.\n4. Both Speaker A and Speaker B are interested in martial arts and enjoy learning new things.\n5. Speaker A is a martial arts teacher and student and is pursuing an athletic training degree in college.\n6. Speaker B is busy debugging software and is a runner.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides quite a bit of helpful information that can aid the language model in generating a meaningful and contextually appropriate next response. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. Relevance to Dialogue: The memory statements about Speaker A being a martial arts teacher and student are directly relevant, as this aligns with Speaker A's mention of attending a martial arts class. Memory statements 2, 3, 4, and 5 help support this, providing more depth to Speaker A's persona as someone deeply involved in martial arts.\n\n2. Connection to Speaker B's Activities: Statement 1 about Speaker B's involvement in software work is relevant to the context, particularly the issue Speaker B faced with their work system. In the dialogue, Speaker B mentions working on upgrading and debugging software, which relates back to their memory.\n\n3. Structure and Natural Flow: The memory describes two distinct aspects - martial arts and software. These are naturally phrased and connected, giving a clear view of the activities both speakers are engaged in. This supports the dialogue context by emphasizing mutual interests and career engagements.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides a helpful scaffold for understanding the dialogue context, showcasing active participation in martial arts for Speaker A and a professional focus on software for Speaker B. These descriptions are structured in a way that enhances the coherence of their previous interactions, allowing for a solid foundation around which the dialogue can develop. However, a perfect score of 5 is not given as some nuances of their interaction could be made more explicitly clear (e.g., more direct connection of statement 1 to the context), but otherwise, it's quite informative."
