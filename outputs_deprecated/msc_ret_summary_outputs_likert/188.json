    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go? Speaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam? Speaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A. Speaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has been getting all A's in the sports medicine class.\n2. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject.\n3. Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring.\n4. Speaker B is on their way to college and studying sports medicine.\n5. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n6. Speaker B studies sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I have a couple more exams left, including one for gym class. I'm feeling pretty confident about that one. How about you? Are you feeling prepared for your upcoming exams?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about Speaker B's academic interests, particularly their involvement in sports medicine, and their performance in that area. It states that Speaker B is taking an exam in sports medicine and doing well, which aligns with the conversation’s focus on exams and academic performance. However, the MEMORY details about Speaker A’s struggles, such as their dislike for history and their challenges in maintaining good grades, do not directly relate to the dialogue context about the finished history exam and upcoming exams. While these details may offer background information, they do not significantly aid in crafting a specific response to the current dialogue. Overall, the MEMORY provides some relevant information but is limited in helping generate a highly contextual response, leading to a mid-range score."
