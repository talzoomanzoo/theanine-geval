Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing? Speaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha! Speaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes? Speaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe.  Speaker A: You make them sounds so fascinating. Will you take them with you to your college dorm? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel.\n2. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans.\n3. Speaker A does not have any pets and expresses an interest in scuba diving.\n4. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n5. Speaker B goes to Hawaii for scuba diving and is considering studying marine life or a different type of animal.\n6. Speaker A is interested in scuba diving and neuroscience, with experience in a research lab.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Nah, I think I'll leave Hansel and Gretel at home with my family. I want to focus on my studies and maybe explore some other types of animals while I'm at college.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information about Speaker B and Speaker A's past interactions, such as Speaker B's interest in reptiles and Speaker A's interest in neuroscience and scuba diving. The detail about Speaker B having two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel is helpful in reinforcing Speaker B's interest in reptiles. However, the detail about Speaker A finding it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans isn't directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\nSome of the MEMORY details, like Speaker A's interest in scuba diving and volunteering at a lab, and Speaker B's consideration to study marine life, might help provide context for future dialogues but don't directly contribute to generating an immediate next response based on the current dialogue about taking pet snakes to a college dorm. Overall, the MEMORY contains a mix of relevant and less relevant information, but it is structured clearly enough for a language model to parse through."
