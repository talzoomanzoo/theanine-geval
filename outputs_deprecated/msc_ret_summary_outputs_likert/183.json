Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you? Speaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses. Speaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set? Speaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up. Speaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe? Speaker B: There is some weird chemical mix that I really do not mess with.  It is easy to clean up.  I try to stay away from this part of the movies.  I know what it should look like and that we want to keep everyone safe when using the fake blood. Speaker A: Chemicals!  Do the actors hate working with it then?  I can imagine they are a pretty high maintenance bunch.  Do they worry about the blood messing with their looks? Speaker B: Our actors are pretty amateur.  No big name ones so they are really good to work with.  Hey, how about you?  How is your interview practice going?  I am pretty sure you be excellent during it! Speaker A: I think this discussion is helping me with making small talk, so thanks.  I just have to try and remember who i am and try to sell my good points. Speaker B: That is a good approach.  I suppose you have been doing research on the company you are interviewing with?  I find it always helps to know the company as best you can for an interview.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\n2. Speaker A is preparing for an upcoming interview and is nervous about it.\n3. Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them.\n4. Speaker A has recently received a call for a job interview and is excited about it.\n5. Speaker A has had flustered moments in past interviews but believes in staying calm.\n6. Speaker B's father was involved in producing horror movies, which influenced Speaker B's favorite genre.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I've been doing my homework on the company. It's always good to show you're interested and prepared. Thanks for the advice!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and helpful context for generating a next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains information about Speaker B's involvement in creating horror movies with their father, which connects to the dialogue about horror movie production. This helps in understanding Speaker B's background and interest in horror movies. Additionally, there is information on Speaker A's preparation for an interview, which ties into the conversation about interview practices.\n\nWhile the MEMORY doesn't directly include specific stories from a movie set or details about fake blood (topics in the dialogue), the information present gives a well-rounded context for Speaker A's and Speaker B's interests and activities, facilitating a better understanding of their conversation. The only slightly misleading or irrelevant information is that Speaker A believes everyone loves horror movies (sentence 3), as this contradicts Speaker A's actual excitement about preparing for an interview rather than producing movies.\n\nOverall, the provided MEMORY reflects the development and interests of both speakers and can assist in generating contextually appropriate responses in the ongoing conversation."
