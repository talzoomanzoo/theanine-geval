Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college? Speaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position.  Speaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it? Speaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days.  Speaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living. Speaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime? Speaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play. Speaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with. Speaker A: Sounds great! Now the tough question: when do you have time?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n2. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.\n3. Speaker A enjoys playing soccer but is not into music.\n4. Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n5. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n6. Speaker A is a fan of Arsenal and enjoys watching international teams play.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "To evaluate the MEMORY based on the given criterion:\n\n1. Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n2. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week.\n3. Speaker A enjoys playing soccer but is not into music.\n4. Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n5. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United.\n6. Speaker A is a fan of Arsenal and enjoys watching international teams play.\n\nHelpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe MEMORY is relatively helpful in providing context for DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The following reasons justify a score of 4:\n\n1. **Relevant Information:** Speaker B, who reminisces about playing soccer in college, is validated by MEMORY point 5. Knowing that Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a Manchester United fan provides background supporting the current dialogue. It suggests that Speaker B has a longstanding interest in soccer, which is related to the decision to re-engage with playing the sport casually as described in the context.\n\n2. **Complementary Information about Speaker A:** Speaker A's involvement in soccer is well-documented in MEMORY points 1, 2, and 4. Although not directly linked to the current context of discussion about casual playing, it supports the notion that Speaker A is actively involved and knowledgeable about soccer, suiting the context where Speaker A is offering to reserve the field.\n\n3. **Some Non-essential but Background Points:** Information like Speaker A not being into music or being a fan of Arsenal versus Manchester United does not directly influence the dialogue but nevertheless adds additional personal layers to their profiles. Such background info might be beneficial for other conversational directions not explored in the immediate context but could be helpful for future dialogue-related decisions.\n\nOverall, MEMORY provides useful information and connections between both speakers in relation to soccer, with sufficient context to provide a relevant response. However, the MEMORY could be improved by including more about the mutual interactions or connections in past dialogues, which limits it from reaching a perfect score of 5."
