Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\n2. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics.\n3. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\n4. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n5. Speaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science.\n6. Speaker B volunteers at their mom's after school program and plans to volunteer at a neighboring university.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I have spoken to my advisor, and teaching does seem like a promising path. I just worry about the limited job opportunities in linguistics compared to other fields.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a wealth of relevant information that helps a language model generate a suitable response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Speaker B's major in linguistics and interest in turning it into a practical career (Memory 1) directly relate to discussing career options. Memory 2 expands on this by revealing Speaker B's consideration of becoming a college professor, a career closely related to teaching mentioned in the dialogue context. Memory 3 highlights Speaker B's concerns about job opportunities, aligning with the discussion of more guaranteed jobs. Memories 4 and 5 provide context about Speaker A's interests and current work, giving a comprehensive understanding of both speakers' backgrounds. Though Memory 6 is less directly related, it still adds depth to Speaker B's character, showing engagement with academia through volunteer work. The sentences are clearly structured and provide valuable context, showcasing the development of Speaker B's career considerations and ambitions, helping the language model to form a well-informed response."
