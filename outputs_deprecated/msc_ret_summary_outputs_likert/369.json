    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job! Speaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. Speaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?   Speaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist, mentioning the ups and downs of the profession.\n2. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n3. Speaker A works at a stable and enjoys being around horses.\n4. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n5. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n6. Speaker A is involved in horse breeding and taking care of horses.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's great that you find therapy in riding your horses. Horses have a unique way of connecting with people and can be really therapeutic. If you ever decide to try therapy, I'd be happy to help guide you through the process.",
    "prediction": "**Helpfulness Score: 3**\n\n**Explanation:** \n\nThe MEMORY provided offers some relevant context to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly the following points: \n\n1. **Speaker B as a Therapist (1, 5):** This is directly relevant as Speaker B's profession is a key part of the dialogue.\n   \n2. **Speaker A's Connection to Horses (3, 6):** Speaker A mentioning how they find therapy in riding horses ties to these points, though the specific details on horse breeding and work at a stable are not directly referenced in the dialogue context.\n\n3. **Speaker A's Limited Knowledge of Psychology (4):** Although not directly discussed, this could be implied when Speaker A mentions \"unresolved childhood trauma\" and might weigh into future dialogue development.\n\nHowever, points such as Speaker B's consideration of psychological aspects of owning a horse (2) and their support for the Chiefs (5) are either not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT or overly specific without sufficient context provided in the MEMORY for their relevance. \n\nOverall, the MEMORY is structured in a way that provides partial helpfulness to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, with several unrelated or insufficiently connected elements."
