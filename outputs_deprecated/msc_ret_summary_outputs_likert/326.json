Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes.  Speaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me. Speaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n2. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly.\n3. Speaker B works at a Raccoon Cafe and takes care of Bandicoot, a raccoon.\n4. Speaker A has not interacted closely with raccoons but admires them.\n5. Speaker B considers raccoons intelligent and funny.\n6. Speaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I completely understand your concern. It's always better to be cautious, especially with wild animals. Just make sure to secure those holes properly with the aluminum sheeting, and hopefully, your raccoon problem will be a thing of the past.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information that can aid Speaker B in generating a response in line with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures Speaker A's raccoon issue (point 1) and Speaker B's affinity and experience with raccoons (points 2, 3, 5, and 6). These points highlight useful contextual connections like Speaker B's familiarity with raccoon behavior and the mention of Bandicoot, the raccoon he takes care of, as well as his view on raccoons as intelligent and potentially pet-worthy. However, point 4 (\"Speaker A has not interacted closely with raccoons but admires them\") is less relevant to the immediate context where Speaker A expresses a desire to avoid more raccoon encounters, showing slight inaccuracy in narrative connection for this dialogue. Most aspects of MEMORY are naturally structured and align well with the ongoing conversation."
