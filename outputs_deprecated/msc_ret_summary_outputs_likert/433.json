Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for. Speaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for? Speaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\n3. Speaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs.\n4. Speaker A is looking for a job and new camping gear, specifically a hammock.\n5. Speaker A plans to bring sandwiches and fruit for the hike, specifically asking about veggie sandwiches for Speaker B.\n6. Speaker A will use the money earned from the store to buy the hammock online.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides several helpful pieces of information that are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and could aid a language model in generating a suitable next response. The information about Speaker A applying to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail complements Speaker A's excitement about the job offer. Additionally, knowing Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there could enhance Speaker B's engagement in the conversation by expressing confidence or positivity about Speaker A's new job environment.\n\nMoreover, the mention of Speaker A being a recent high school graduate and on a cross-country journey aligns with their search for jobs, providing a nuanced understanding of Speaker A's background and disposition, which could be woven into further conversation. Speaker A's desire to buy a hammock with earnings from the job connects to their overarching goal, giving added depth to their motivations.\n\nHowever, some details, like the specific inquiry about veggie sandwiches or the intent to purchase camping gear, do seem tangential and don't directly support the ongoing dialogue about employment. Yet, these elements still situate Speaker A's character comprehensively within their immediate goals and wider journey.\n\nThus, MEMORY effectively enriches the conversation with relevant past interactions and details, though not every sentence directly aligns with the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
