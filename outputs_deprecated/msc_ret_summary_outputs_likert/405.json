Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue. Speaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad. Speaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs! Speaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours? Speaker A: Ikea! Their furniture is not to expensive and they have all kinds of furniture that'll go with whatever scheme you're going for. What kind of patio furniture were you looking for? Like a barbeque, chairs, hammock?  Speaker B: I guess I was going to get like an umbrella table and some chairs to go with it or maybe even a screened in gazebo with a fire pit in the middle. Speaker A: That's a great idea! Sounds like a very nice place for a barbeque. What were you planning on grilling for the barbeque?  Speaker B: I'll get the steaks to grill if you will bring the corn. And I have a request for you to play on the guitar, I know you are into country so if you could maybe play a song or two by Miranda Lambert, that would be awesome.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n2. Speaker A is looking forward to spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights.\n3. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy barbecuing and have a love for pets.\n4. Speaker B plans to grill steaks this weekend and prefers using an old charcoal grill over a gas one.\n5. Speaker B plans to bring a new marinade and a six pack of beer for the gathering.\n6. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to meet up to discuss the furniture exchange.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides somewhat helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is not optimal. Sentence 1 in the MEMORY is remotely connected to the discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about having a barbecue, though it reverses the roles of who is inviting whom. Sentence 2 and Sentence 3 provide relevant context that both speakers enjoy barbecuing, which aligns with the current plan for the barbecue. Sentence 4 provides relevant details about Speaker B grilling steaks, consistent with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, although the preference for a charcoal grill is new information that wasn't mentioned earlier. Sentence 5 is partially relevant as it highlights Speaker B's contributions to the barbecue, adding to the context but not directly referenced in the dialogue. Sentence 6 does not align with the main subject discussed, as there's no indication of a furniture exchange within the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, the MEMORY includes useful information, but the connections to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT are not as clear or as directly supportive as they could be, especially with discrepancies in roles and added details not present in the context."
