Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden. Speaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways? Speaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n2. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip.\n3. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country.\n4. Speaker A and Speaker B discussed the differences between Sweden and the US, including coffee breaks.\n5. Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses.\n6. Speaker B misses Sweden and has fond memories of the country.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "There are so many beautiful places to see in Sweden! Definitely make sure to visit Stockholm for its stunning architecture and history, and maybe take a trip to the countryside for some nature adventures. And don't forget to enjoy some fika (coffee break) while you're there!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains information that is generally helpful in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences provide a contextual background that Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden (sentences 2 and 3), which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A mentions their cousin helping with planning. Sentence 1 indicates that Speaker A and Speaker B have plans to travel to Sweden together, which may influence Speaker B's interest in the details of the trip. Sentence 4 shows a relevant past discussion about Sweden, which could form the basis of further conversation about the country. Sentence 6 indicates Speaker B's personal connection and feelings about Sweden, contributing to their interest in the conversation. Although sentence 5 is not directly related to the current planning dialogue, it provides context for Speaker B's engagement. Overall, MEMORY provides useful information that aligns with the context, yet some sentences don't seem to effectively reflect Speaker B's past interactions or attitudes directly relevant to generating a helpful response."
