Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting! Speaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow? Speaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\n3. Speaker B is considering giving up their night job to focus on lab work and school.\n4. Speaker B is planning to major in molecular biology.\n5. Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, showing an interest in neuroscience.\n6. Speaker B is also a high school student preparing for college, working at a diner at night.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information regarding Speaker B's background, which could assist in generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, MEMORY points out Speaker B's involvement in lab research (2), their consideration to quit the night job for school and lab work (3), their weekends lab work indicating interest in neuroscience (5), and their status as a high school student preparing for college (6). This context aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Speaker B talks about continuing work in a lab and balancing it with school. However, the MEMORY lacks specific details directly relevant to the cloning lab and does not precisely cover Speaker A's thoughts on eating hamburgers from a cloned cow. Therefore, there is a moderate connection between MEMORY and DIALOGUE CONTEXT, and while MEMORY is informative, it could be more closely aligned with the specific context of the conversation."
