    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like. Speaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk? Speaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous. Speaker B: That sounds amazing! Did you bring a pet? I love doing the harder trails with my dog. Sometimes, it's very peaceful to get away from everything. Speaker A: No, I don't have any pets; my apartment seems too small for a dog and I would worry about them being lonely all day when I'm at work. I was thinking about getting a pair of cats, but I haven't committed yet. How nice fo ryou to have company when you're walking though! What kind of dog do you have? Speaker B: Cats can be nice! I used to have cats, but am allergic to them and had to give them to my friend. I have an Australian Kelpie who is a rescue. She is very energetic and smart! Speaker A: I had cats as a child and I think that they're a bit easier to care for than dogs, especially in the city. I am a dog lover as well though; Australian Kelpies are gorgeous! What is her name? Does she walk well off-leash? Speaker B: Yes, cats are very smart and clean. Mine used to bring me a mouse to throw for her, just like a dog! And if you have 2 cats, they play with each other! Mine would run up and down the halls in the middle of the night, haha. Her name is Kyrie, and she walks off leash and is very obedient. Dogs might be hard to keep in your small apartment though, since Kyrie likes to play in the field, run with cars along the fence row, and herd goats.  Speaker A: Oh wow! So Kyrie is a working dog? She helps your dad out on the farm? Speaker B: She herds them for fun, haha. Goats mostly graze wherever they like in the fields, but she likes to group them up and walk them into a pen. My grandpa says it's from her cattle herding heritage. Speaker A: I like the idea of having so much space out in the country, but I think at heart I'm still a city girl. There is a part of me that likes being surrounded by people and I love to people watch on my walks through the city just as much as I love to nature watch on my walks through the country.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B lives in the country, loves nature, and works with animals.\n2. Speaker A is a city dweller who walks to work instead of driving.\n3. Speaker B is an artist who walks through nature for work.\n4. Speaker B enjoys reading the Odd Thomas and Dark Tower series and finds inspiration for their artwork during nature walks.\n5. Speaker A also enjoyed reading 'Redwall' growing up and keeps an eye out for similar books.\n6. Speaker A is a fan of the Game of Thrones series and enjoys audiobooks.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's great that you find joy in both city life and nature walks. It's nice to have a balance of both worlds. People watching can be just as fascinating as nature watching, each offering its own unique perspective.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some useful information for contextualizing the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, mainly about Speaker B's love for nature and living in the country, which is relevant to Speaker B's part in the conversation regarding walks, nature, and pets. Sentence 1 correlates well with the dialogue context as it highlights Speaker B's lifestyle, which is discussed in the conversation. However, several sentences in the MEMORY, such as those about reading preferences in sentences 4, 5, and 6, do not directly connect to the current conversation. Sentence 3, while mentioning nature walks, has inaccuracies (Speaker B does not walk through nature for work but for leisure) and thus, it somewhat confuses the understanding of Speaker Bâ€™s background. Overall, the MEMORY provides some useful context, but some parts are either irrelevant or inaccuracies that slightly hinder its helpfulness."
