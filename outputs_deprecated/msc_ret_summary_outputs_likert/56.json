Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place? Speaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n2. Speaker B expresses concern about leaving a kitten alone during their family camping adventures.\n3. Speaker B is away from their child and glad that the pets are with them.\n4. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities.\n5. Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys.\n6. Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information for generating a proper next response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, MEMORY points 1 and 6 are related to Speaker B's daughter's interest in visiting places like the zoo, which could connect to her enjoying the recent trip, mentioned in the dialogue. Additionally, point 3 adds context regarding Speaker B's concerns with pets during trips, which could be referenced when discussing camping experiences. However, points 4 and 5, while they provide background about Speaker A's interests, do not directly align with the current conversation topic of camping and the recent trip. Moreover, the structure of the MEMORY can be improved so that sentences are better connected or demonstrate clearer development. Overall, the MEMORY has useful elements but lacks coherence in terms of directly aiding the dialogue continuation on the topic of camping."
