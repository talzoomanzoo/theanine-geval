Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist? Speaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job! Speaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing. Speaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?   Speaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone. Speaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you? Speaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know. Speaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient! \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a therapist, mentioning the ups and downs of the profession.\n2. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n3. Speaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs.\n4. Speaker A works at a stable and enjoys being around horses.\n5. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology.\n6. Speaker B has been working in their own practice for about six years.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's really interesting to hear. I guess everyone's journey is different when it comes to therapy. I appreciate the offer, I'll definitely consider it.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a proper response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentences 1 and 6 are particularly helpful because they reinforce Speaker B's professional background as a therapist, which is relevant to the ongoing conversation about therapy and Speaker B's offer to help Speaker A. Sentence 4 gives context to Speaker A's interest in horses, which has already been mentioned in the dialogue. Sentence 2, while not directly relevant to the immediate dialogue, contributes to understanding Speaker B's connection of other interests to psychology, which might inform future conversations. Sentence 5 is useful in explaining Speaker A's lack of knowledge in psychology, which aligns with the dialogue's exploration of therapy. Sentence 3, related to Speaker B's interest in football, is not directly useful for generating the next response in the current context, but it is phrased clearly enough to be identified as less relevant. Overall, the MEMORY is structured well and provides a helpful context for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
