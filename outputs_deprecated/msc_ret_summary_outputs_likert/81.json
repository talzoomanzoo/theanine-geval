Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me? Speaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week? Speaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day Speaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through Speaker A: Actually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plans to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit.\n2. Speaker A invited Speaker B to visit and mentioned looking into flights.\n3. Speaker B found flights that work for their schedule and price and will be visiting Speaker A in a couple of weeks.\n4. Speaker A has invited Speaker B to visit them and is excited about the trip.\n5. Speaker B is planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n6. Speaker A has visited Alaska and describes it as beautiful, suggesting cheap flights to Anchorage.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains details about the interaction between Speaker A and Speaker B, specifically concerning the visit and plans for attending concerts, which align with the ongoing conversation. For example, sentences 1, 2, and 5 effectively summarize key aspects of the dialogue, such as Speaker A's invitation and concert plans, and Speaker B's interest in visiting and concerts. These sentences are helpful for generating responses related to the conversation's topic. However, sentence 3 mentions that Speaker B has already found flights and will be visiting in a couple of weeks, which contradicts Speaker B's current wait for ticket prices to decrease, as seen in the dialogue context. Sentence 6 is not directly related to the current conversation but is naturally phrased, which allows the model to easily discern it as less relevant. Overall, the MEMORY is mostly coherent and aids in understanding the context, though the minor inconsistency in sentence 3 prevents it from being a perfect score."
