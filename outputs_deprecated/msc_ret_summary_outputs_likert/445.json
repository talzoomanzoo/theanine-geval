Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive. Speaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price? Speaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music Speaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n2. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\n3. Speaker A bought 50 lotto tickets with different numbers to increase their chances of winning.\n4. Speaker B bought 20 lotto tickets with the same numbers, aiming to get a bigger share of the jackpot if they win.\n5. Speaker B's children have been sick, and Speaker B also had a fever, possibly influencing their decision to buy 20 lotto tickets.\n6. Speaker B believes that luxurious items distract from the value of their family.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, winning the lotto would definitely make things easier. But I'd still enjoy the music even if I don't win.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several sentences that are directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The conversation mentions the lotto, and MEMORY provides helpful background information about how both speakers have previously engaged with buying lotto tickets and their strategies, which aligns well with Speaker B's mention of winning the lotto in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This continuity in the conversation allows for a coherent and contextually aware response from the language model. Additionally, MEMORY includes Speaker B's value of family over luxurious items, which could enrich the undercurrent in their conversation. Although the sentence about Speaker B's children being sick is less directly linked to the current topic of conversation, it is still meaningful context regarding Speaker B's life, lending depth to potential responses. Overall, MEMORY is mostly relevant and well-structured, facilitating an informed and context-tailored response."
