    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it! Thank you for the recommendation. Speaker B: Of course. I recommend that movie to everyone I meet. I think I've watched it over one hundred times. So what is the next movie on your list to watch soon? Speaker A: Yeah it was great and I will also recommend to people when they ask what movie is good. So next is another one you recommended which is coming to America. What’s the next movie your going to watch?  Speaker B: There is a horror genre movie that was released just this week which I'm going to watch tonight. It is called \"Girl Next.\" Speaker A: Oh that sounds interesting, I will look into that and put it on my list. How has your job been going? Is there where you get all these great ideas for what to watch?   Speaker B: My Film Studies professor job has been going absolutely great lately. I love all my students, because they really get into the lectures and ask lots of questions. Yes, my job requires me to watch movies all the time, so that is how I find the best ones. Is your programmer job going all right lately? Speaker A: That sounds amazing. Super lucky to have students that really enjoy what they are learning about and I’m sure that’s down to the way you teach and what you teach them. I’m so glad it is all going well for you. Yeah it is going much better now, I’m really getting in the swing of things thank you for asking.  Speaker B: You're welcome. So, returning to the subject of Pulp Fiction, did you think it was funny? Did you think it was too violent for kids to watch?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A is interested in watching movies, mentioned Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman.\n2.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures the essence of Speaker A's interest in movies and reliance on Speaker B for recommendations (points 1, 2, and 4), which directly connects to the context. Memory 1 is somewhat relevant as it mentions \"Pulp Fiction,\" which is a part of the Dialogue Context. Point 3 reflects Speaker B's background in film studies, which explains their extensive movie knowledge and the source of their recommendations, connecting well with the context of Speaker B's discussion about their job. However, points 5 and 6 in the MEMORY don't directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and are not as relevant in connecting to the immediate conversation, reducing the overall score. Overall, the MEMORY provides a good foundation for understanding the speakers' dynamics and conversation history, thus earning a score of 4."
