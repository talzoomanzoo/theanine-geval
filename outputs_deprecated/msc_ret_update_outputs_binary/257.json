    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY does not contain any information directly related to the question about actors' feelings towards chemicals and concern about their looks. The MEMORY primarily provides information about Speaker A and Speaker B's involvement in horror movies, their preferences, and their aspirations, but nothing about the actors' reactions to chemicals.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
