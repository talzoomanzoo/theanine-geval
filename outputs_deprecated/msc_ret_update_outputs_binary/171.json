    "raw_prediction": "That makes sense. I'll look into renting a car then. I wouldn't want to run into any wolves or elk unexpectedly. It sounds like having a car will give us more flexibility to explore safely.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY contains information that Speaker A has mentioned the presence of elk and wolves in the context of their location, as seen in memory point 6. This information is relevant because Speaker A's current statement refers to the dangers associated with wolves and elk in the area, which could be crucial for ensuring Speaker B's safety and ensuring they are aware of potential hazards when considering walking to town during the visit.\n\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
