    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY contains detailed information about Speaker B's and Speaker A's plans related to outdoor activities and interest in wildlife. Since Speaker B in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT talks about seeing wildlife, having MEMORY about their plans for outdoor activities, interest in wildlife, and a past conversation about wildlife can help Parent generate relevant responses.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
