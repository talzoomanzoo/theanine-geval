I thought it was cool at first, you know, to see a raccoon unlock a door. And now, I regret it so much. I've had to change the layout of my apartment and put deadbolts on my doors so that Bandicoot can't get out. And, he is sneaky about it. One time, he unlocked the pantry and was eating some cookies! It's like having a toddler that never grows up.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n2. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly.\n3. Bandicoot was a rescue and has been at the Raccoon Cafe since he was a baby.\n4. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n5. Speaker B owns a raccoon named Bandicoot and a bearded dragon named Bob.\n6. Speaker A is worried about the raccoon potentially eating the bearded dragon.",

    "raw_prediction": "Wow, Bandicoot sounds like quite the troublemaker! I can't imagine the stress of having to constantly outsmart a raccoon. It must keep you on your toes. I hope you find a way to keep him entertained without causing too much chaos in your home.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY provides information about Speaker B's experiences and views on owning raccoons, including Bandicoot's background as a rescue and Speaker B's familiarity with caring for them. This context helps the language model understand Speaker B's statement about regretting teaching Bandicoot to unlock doors and altering the apartment for safety, which is consistent with managing a pet raccoon.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
