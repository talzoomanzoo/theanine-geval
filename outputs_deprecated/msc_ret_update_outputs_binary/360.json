    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context is about Speaker B's memories related to video games and their question about Speaker A's gaming preferences. MEMORY provides specific information about Speaker B's gaming history and preferences, including their enjoyment of Resident Evil and other games, which can be helpful for generating a response. However, MEMORY mainly focuses on Speaker A's hesitancy towards horror games, while Speaker B seems to inquire about Speaker A's preferences in the current context. Therefore, MEMORY may contain some relevant background about Speaker B but doesn't provide significant new insights into the specific question asked.\n\nJudgement: No"
