    "raw_prediction": "Movie blood can be made from a variety of ingredients like corn syrup, food coloring, and sometimes even chocolate syrup for a more realistic look. My favorite recipe includes corn syrup, red food coloring, and a touch of cocoa powder for texture. It's quite fun experimenting with different mixtures to get the perfect blood consistency for each scene.",

MEMORY contains relevant information about Speaker A and Speaker B's interest and involvement in horror movies, which could be helpful for Speaker A to engage more with Speaker B potentially based on their mutual interest and knowledge in horror films.\nJudgement: Yes"
