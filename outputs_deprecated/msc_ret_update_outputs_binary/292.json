    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT refers to a conversation about rice sticking together and a non-related topic about riding along. MEMORY provides information about Speaker B's lack of cooking skills and interest in learning, Speaker A's cooking expertise, and their shared interest in cooking. However, the context of the conversation is more about the logistics of rice cooking and an unrelated activity (riding along), which does not strongly connect to the cooking details in MEMORY.\nJudgement: \"No\""
