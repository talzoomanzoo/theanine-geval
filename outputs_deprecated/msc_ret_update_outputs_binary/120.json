    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY contains information about Speaker A working at a restaurant and their appreciation for leftover baked goods, but it does not specifically relate to the conversation topic about oatmeal raisin cookies or Speaker A's brothers' opinions on them. The MEMORY entries don't provide helpful past information that directly influences Speaker A's comments about cookies in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
