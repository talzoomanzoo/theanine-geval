Plus, they will give you a good feel for using the appliance before moving on to more complex dishes. Enjoy your cooking adventure!",

Speaker A is experienced in using a pressure cooker and recommends it to Speaker B for its simplicity and efficiency. Considering this background, the MEMORY contains useful past information to help Speaker A, the Parent, suggest a suitable recipe that aligns with Speaker B's interest in learning how to use a pressure cooker.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
