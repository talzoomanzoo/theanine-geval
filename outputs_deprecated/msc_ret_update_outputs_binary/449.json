    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate your enthusiasm for learning martial arts history! Sufi sounds like a great choice for take-out, but have you considered trying the new Taco Bell in town?",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY contains information that Speaker A is a martial arts teacher and student, and both speakers share an interest in martial arts, which is relevant to Speaker B's comment about being passionate about martial arts. However, MEMORY about Speaker A being lactose intolerant and interested in trying new restaurants could be potentially relevant if Sufi offers food that might affect these aspects, but it's not directly helpful for a proper next response concerning the discussion about martial arts and the immediate decision to grab take-out.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
