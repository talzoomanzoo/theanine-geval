The lock requires a specific key, which I have hidden in my drawers. For medication, I have a small box that I also keep locked up, but it's a combination lock, so Bandicoot isn't able to get into it. For driving, I bought a harness that keeps him strapped in the back seat, he can move a bit, but mostly sturdy. I put blankets down and his favorite toys so that he stays calm. Sometimes, I'll pass small snacks to keep him occupied. I also take the side streets to work so that it's not too much for him. What about you? When you foster dogs, do you put them in a cage when you drive?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n2. Bandicoot was a rescue and has been at the Raccoon Cafe since he was a baby.\n3. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly.\n4. Speaker B owns a raccoon named Bandicoot and a bearded dragon named Bob.\n5. Speaker A is worried about the raccoon potentially eating the bearded dragon.\n6. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad to hear you have everything securely locked away. Safety first! When I foster dogs, I usually use a dog seatbelt or a crate in the car to keep them secure. It's important for both their safety and mine while driving. It sounds like you've really thought things through with Bandicoot.",
