    "raw_prediction": "I totally get that! It's surprising how much sugar goes into desserts. Maybe you can try experimenting with low-sugar or sugar-free recipes to satisfy your sweet tooth without the guilt. You could even try making a healthier version of jello using natural sweeteners or fruit juices.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY indicates that Speaker B is interested in learning about cooking and baking, and they also enjoy jello, which is relevant to their discussion about desserts and sugar in baking. This memory can help Parent to create a connection by perhaps suggesting jello as an alternative dessert to baking or referencing past jello discussions.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
