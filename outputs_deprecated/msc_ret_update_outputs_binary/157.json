Until then, I'm really looking forward to my Hawaii sunset tour. I'll be sure to share all the details with you when I get back!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context discusses potential future travel plans and Speaker B expresses a desire to visit Italy. However, the memory provided mostly revolves around Disney movies and family activities related to movies, with no information relevant to Italy or travel experiences. Therefore, the memory does not contain any helpful past information to generate a relevant response to the question about visiting Italy.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
