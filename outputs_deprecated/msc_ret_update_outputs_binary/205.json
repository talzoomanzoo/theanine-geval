    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The information in the MEMORY focuses on Speaker A's interests and activities, primarily around soccer and college plans, and Speaker B's background in soccer. However, the DIALOGUE CONTEXT discusses scheduling a meeting around Speaker B's work schedule, which is unrelated to the specifics in MEMORY about soccer or college. None of these points directly correlate with planning a weekend event.\nJudgement: \"No\""
