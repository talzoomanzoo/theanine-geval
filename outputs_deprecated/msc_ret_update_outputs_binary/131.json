The MEMORY provided is related to activities, interests, and preferences of Speaker A and B, but it does not contain any information specifically related to SPF products, Italian food, or any shared experiences that could directly help generate a relevant response to Speaker A's statement about the Italian sub. Therefore, MEMORY does not contain helpful information for the current dialogue context.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
