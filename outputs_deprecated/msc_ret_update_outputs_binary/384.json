    "raw_prediction": "Upper arm or upper back would be great spots for a tattoo! It's always good to consider your spouse's opinion too. It's a big decision, but it sounds like you're on the right track.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY does not contain information that directly relates to or enhances the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Speaker B is discussing potential tattoo placements and the need to get permission from their wife before proceeding. The MEMORY mainly focuses on Speaker A's tattoos and their job, while Speaker B's memory recall is more about their personal interests and family wishes. The contextual link to the conversation about tattoos and the need for spousal permission is not found in the provided MEMORY.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
