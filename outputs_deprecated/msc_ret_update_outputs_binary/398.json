    "raw_prediction": "That's a smart approach with the dogs. It's important to ensure their safety while driving. Bandicoot has gotten used to his routine now, but it took some time to figure out what works best for him. It's all about trial and error, just like training any pet. Have you thought about getting a pet raccoon yourself? They can be quite the handful but also incredibly rewarding with the right care and attention.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: MEMORY does not contain relevant information regarding dogs, which is the current topic of discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Instead, MEMORY focuses on raccoons and the care given to them by Speaker B. There is no mention of dogs or Speaker A's practices involving them, meaning the MEMORY does not provide useful context for continuing the dialogue about dogs.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
