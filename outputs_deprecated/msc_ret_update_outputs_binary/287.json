    "raw_prediction": "Yes, shrimp fried rice typically includes eggs, so it's a fantastic recipe to incorporate your homegrown eggs. It's a delicious and satisfying dish that's relatively easy to make in a pressure cooker. Let me know if you need any tips or guidance when you're ready to give it a try!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY contains details about Speaker B's interest in learning about cooking and Speaker A's expertise with a pressure cooker. However, there is no information specifically about eggs or any relevant recipe that Speaker B might be referring to. The MEMORY does not seem to directly address the question asked in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about a dish containing eggs.\nJudgement: \"No\""
