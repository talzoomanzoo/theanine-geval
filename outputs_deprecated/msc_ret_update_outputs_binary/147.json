    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context is about camping experiences, and the memory does not provide any information on Speaker B's camping habits or preferences, which could be relevant to know in this context. The memory mainly contains unrelated facts about Speaker B's concerns over a pet, their recent move, and involvement with school activities, none of which directly provide insights into camping preferences or experiences.\nJudgement: \"No\""
