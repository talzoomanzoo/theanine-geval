    "raw_prediction": "Yes, Bandicoot has been a quick learner! I've been teaching him some basic tricks like rolling over and standing on his hind legs. It's amazing how intelligent and curious raccoons can be. If you ever decide to befriend them instead of keeping them away, you might be surprised at how entertaining and charming they can be.",

This detail aligns with the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A asks if Speaker B has been able to teach their raccoon any tricks. The information is relevant and can be useful for Parent to generate an appropriate response.\n\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
