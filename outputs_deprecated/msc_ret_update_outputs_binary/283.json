    "raw_prediction": "You should definitely give surfing a try, it's so much fun! Maybe we can plan a trip to Greece or Italy where you can learn to surf on the beautiful beaches there. It would be an amazing experience to share together!",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY contains information about Speaker B's enjoyment of Greek mythology and a case study on Poseidon, the God of the Sea (MEMORY 3) and Speaker B's residency in California with a love for its beaches (MEMORY 6). Both these aspects could be relevant because surfing is related to the sea and beaches, potentially leading to a topic of interest in Poseidon or the Californian surfing experience. However, neither directly pertains to surfing expertise or experience.\nJudgement: Yes"
