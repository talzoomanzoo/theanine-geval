    "raw_prediction": "That's so interesting! Kyrie sounds like a very active and intelligent dog. It must be amazing to watch her herd the goats just for fun. It's great that she gets to use her natural instincts in a playful way. Do you ever join in on the herding fun with her?",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around herding goats and mentions Speaker B's grandpa and a reference to cattle herding heritage. However, none of the MEMORY points provide relevant information about herding, goats, or grandpa. Information about where Speaker B lives, enjoys nature, or family composition could tangentially relate, but nothing specifically aids in enhancing response to the context mentioned here.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
