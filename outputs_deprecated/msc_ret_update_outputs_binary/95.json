    "raw_prediction": "Starting with Youtube videos at home is a great idea to get a feel for Pilates! It's a good way to see if you enjoy the exercises before committing to a class. Plus, you might even be able to involve your pets in the workout somehow, knowing how creative you are with them!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The current dialogue context involves a discussion about starting Pilates, specifically whether one can start at home or needs to go to a class. Relevant information from the memory would be about Speaker A's experience with Pilates classes, which could provide insight or encouragement based on personal experience or preferences. Memory point 4 mentions that Speaker A goes to Pilates classes, which is directly relevant to the context and can inform a helpful response.\n\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
