    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely, I would definitely try a hamburger from a cloned cow! It's fascinating to think about the advancements in science and how it can potentially revolutionize the food industry. Your work in the lab must be so intriguing, especially with your interest in molecular biology.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The statement in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT refers to the difficulty of classes and the hypothetical question about eating a hamburger from a cloned cow. MEMORY contains relevant information such as Speaker B's struggle with balancing a job and school, which informs their concern about quitting if classes become too difficult, connecting to their broader commitment to their molecular biology studies. Furthermore, the MEMORY indicates Speaker B's involvement in cooking, which is relevant to the mention of hamburgers, albeit from a cloned cow.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
