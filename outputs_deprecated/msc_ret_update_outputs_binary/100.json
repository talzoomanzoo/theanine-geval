    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a fantastic idea! Dog sledding is a popular activity in Alaska, especially during the winter months when there's snow on the ground. And your friend is right, Alaska experiences long daylight hours in the summer due to its northern location, so you'll have plenty of time to enjoy all the outdoor adventures during your trip.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information about the speakers planning a trip to Alaska together and considering outdoor activities. This gives context about Speaker B's interest and uncertainty related to Alaskan activities like sledding, aligning with the dialogue context.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
