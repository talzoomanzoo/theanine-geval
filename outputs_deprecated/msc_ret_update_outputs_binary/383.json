    "raw_prediction": "I was thinking of getting it on my forearm. I've heard that area isn't too painful for tattoos. Maybe I'll gather my courage and finally get one to honor my family.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context is centered on the topic of tattoos, specifically about the pain experienced based on the location of the tattoo. Speaker A is discussing their personal experiences. The information from the memory that Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has several already is relevant because it provides context for why they might be knowledgeable about the subject. Additionally, memory items detailing Speaker A's plans for future tattoos could also be useful in continuing the conversation about tattoos.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
