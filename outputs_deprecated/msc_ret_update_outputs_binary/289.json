    "raw_prediction": "Cooking the rice beforehand allows it to cool and dry out slightly, which helps prevent it from becoming too sticky when you fry it. It's a common technique in fried rice recipes to achieve that perfect texture. Plus, using your own fresh eggs will definitely add a delicious touch to the dish!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY indicates that Speaker B is not skilled in cooking but is interested in learning about it, especially using a pressure cooker. Speaker A is proficient in cooking and enjoys using pressure cookers for various recipes, which might indicate why they have specific knowledge about cooking rice beforehand. This background can help Speaker A provide an informed and relevant response to Speaker B's inquiry about cooking rice.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
