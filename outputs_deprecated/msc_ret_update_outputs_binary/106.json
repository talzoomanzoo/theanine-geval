    "raw_prediction": "I don't think Rocky and Bullwinkle were specifically from Alaska, but they were definitely inspired by the northern wilderness. Maybe you'll find some fun souvenirs related to them on your trip! Just remember to stick with your friend's advice to stay safe and enjoy all the unique experiences Alaska has to offer.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY contains helpful information about Speaker B planning a trip to Alaska, which aligns with their current discussion about traveling to Alaska. This context is relevant, as Speaker B is speaking about their upcoming travel plans and their friend assisting with local customs in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, and they mention the importance of understanding local customs. This connection may be useful in forming a relevant response to their query about an Alaskan-related topic (e.g., Rocky and Bullwinkle).\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
