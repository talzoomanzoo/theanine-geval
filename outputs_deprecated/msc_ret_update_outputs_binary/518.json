    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear that you'll be visiting on your own. It will give you a chance to fully immerse yourself in the language and culture. Soap operas are a fun way to pick up some new phrases and get a feel for the language. I'm sure you'll have a fantastic time in Spain and Portugal!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context focuses on Speaker A's solo travel plans and watching soap operas to prepare for it. The memory contains information about Speaker A's sons studying and traveling abroad, which is unrelated to the context of Speaker A's independent travel plans and leisure activities. There is no direct link between the memory and the dialogue context that would assist in generating a relevant next response.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
