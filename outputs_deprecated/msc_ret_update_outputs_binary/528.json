    "raw_prediction": "I'll definitely remember to bring sunscreen this time! Hopefully, the beach won't be as crowded as the concert was. I can't wait to relax with some refreshing beers by the beach after visiting the museum in São Paulo. It sounds like a perfect day ahead.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context is about a visit to the beach and avoiding getting sunburned. The MEMORY contains information about Speaker A's love for Disney music, museum visits, food preferences, beach plans with their boyfriend, and Speaker B's interest in music concerts and summer tours. However, none of this information is directly helpful for generating a response about visiting the beach or wearing sunscreen. \nJudgement: \"No\""
