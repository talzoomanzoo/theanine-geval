Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \nSpeaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!).\nSpeaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol\nSpeaker B: I am up for the challenge! I have a few tricks up my sleeve to deal with people like you.\nSpeaker A: Oh geez that makes me sound difficult.lol  Do you have any new speeches coming up?\nSpeaker B: Nope, I just cleared my schedule until the Alps marathon that you're training for. It's just you and me until you break that finish line. I'm going to start sending you a motivational quote every morning at 4 am when I want you to wake up.\nSpeaker A: Wow 4 am.  Is it too late to change my mind?lol\nSpeaker B: Yes. We have an iron-clad written agreement. Tell me how I'm doing so far. Is this the most motivated you've ever been in your entire life?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, who travels frequently for work and misses their wife and kids, has previous experience running a marathon and found it tough but rewarding. Speaker A, originally from Venice Beach, is a dedicated runner working on improving their mile time and training for a marathon. Speaker B, a motivational speaker from San Francisco who enjoys fishing and the outdoors, has a job that involves motivating people to be successful and follow their dreams. Additionally, Speaker A and Speaker B have joked about combining fishing with feeling depressed and taking young boys to the pond during school hours.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Definitely up there in the top three most motivated moments of my life! Let's get after it!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides insightful background information about both speakers that is beneficial for generating a suitable next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes Speaker B’s profession as a motivational speaker and their relationship with their family, indicating potential insights into Speaker B’s motivations and approach. The MEMORY highlights Speaker B's previous marathon experience, which aligns with the context of motivating Speaker A for a marathon, adding relevancy. The memory also includes some lighter, humorous elements (like the joke about combining fishing and feeling depressed), which demonstrate past interactions that may mirror their current light-hearted exchange. However, the reasoning behind combining such activities is not clear or directly connected to the contextual dialogue, slightly hindering full assessment to a perfect score."
