Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play? \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is skilled in writing and is part of a band where they play the drums and write music, with 4 members including the singer who is their best friend. This band tours different countries for their music, having visited Italy, Uzbekistan, and smaller countries in Central and South America.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It explains that Speaker A plays the drums, which directly answers the question from Speaker A, \"What instrument do you play?\" Moreover, it adds context by mentioning they are part of a band, they write music, and they tour internationally. This information can be useful for Speaker B to generate a more informed and engaging response about Speaker A's musical involvement. The memory contains sentences that are naturally connected and give a coherent picture of Speaker A's musical activities, contributing to a smooth flow of conversation."
