Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies!\nSpeaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?  \nSpeaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere!\nSpeaker B: You have a point.  It is nice to see puppies wagging their tail and just following you!  Changing topics, do you have any recipes with asparagus?  You know, it's such a popular vegetable, but I just don't know how to prepare it.\nSpeaker A: I don't have recipes but I know how to make a good grilled asparagus. Are you looking to bolster your chef book?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B used to foster puppies but no longer does, while Speaker A is busy with work. Speaker A enjoys cooking, especially making fajitas, and also volunteers at animal shelters. \nSpeaker A is more interested in science than music, while Speaker B enjoys listening to Black Sabbath and grilling meat. They are excited about the idea of traveling the world and trying different cuisines, with Speaker A suggesting grilled asparagus with lemon. \nSpeaker A is an inventor working on a time machine and enjoys teleporting around the world. Speaker B is interested in trying different careers and is considering becoming a chef for Speaker A, who loves Mexican food and seafood. Speaker B is working on a project to build their resume and is unsure about the type of work they want to do.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a substantial amount of potentially useful information for generating a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It reveals Speaker A's enthusiasm for cooking and mentions that they enjoy making fajitas and grilled asparagus, specifically with lemonâ€”a detail that connects with the current discussion about asparagus. It also highlights that Speaker B used to foster puppies, providing context for their interest in the initial conversation about animals. Furthermore, there is mention of Speaker B considering different career options, including becoming a chef, which aligns with their inquiry about recipes. However, the MEMORY also contains some details that are not directly relevant to the current dialogue or do not clearly demonstrate the causality needed to fully enrich the conversation, such as Speaker A inventing a time machine and teleporting. Nonetheless, the relevant parts of the MEMORY are naturally connected and enhance the context considerably, meriting a high score."
