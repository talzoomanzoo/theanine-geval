Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself!\nSpeaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food?\nSpeaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too?\nSpeaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also?\nSpeaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys working with animals and has penguins at the zoo. Speaker B is excited about the opportunity at the zoo and is looking for a new job. Speaker B has elderly terriers and is planning to leave their part-time job for a break before starting a new one.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nWhile the MEMORY provides some background information about Speaker A and B, such as their work with animals and career plans, it does not directly contribute to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT related to dogs getting into food or specific details about the dogs like their behavior or ability to open fridges. The MEMORY does not establish any clear connection or causality with the topics discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making it of limited help in generating a relevant next response."
