Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies!\nSpeaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?  \nSpeaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere!\nSpeaker B: You have a point.  It is nice to see puppies wagging their tail and just following you!  Changing topics, do you have any recipes with asparagus?  You know, it's such a popular vegetable, but I just don't know how to prepare it.\nSpeaker A: I don't have recipes but I know how to make a good grilled asparagus. Are you looking to bolster your chef book?\nSpeaker B: I sure am!  Grilled asparagus does sound good.  Do you pair the grilled asparagus with your fajitas?  What do you prefer, chicken or beef fajitas?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A loves animals, especially puppies, and visits shelters in every city they go to. Speaker A enjoys cooking, especially making fajitas, and also volunteers at animal shelters. Speaker A enjoys grilling indoors and suggests grilled asparagus with lemon on it. Speaker A suggests that working as a line cook or chef involves a big time commitment and building a working family. \nSpeaker B is a 26-year-old workaholic who is excited about the idea of traveling the world and trying different cuisines. Speaker B enjoys listening to Black Sabbath and grilling meat. Speaker B is interested in trying different careers and is considering becoming a chef for Speaker A who loves Mexican food and seafood.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I usually pair the grilled asparagus with seafood fajitas, it adds a nice contrast of flavors. How about you, do you prefer chicken or beef fajitas?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information for constructing a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It accurately represents Speaker A's love for animals, particularly puppies, which aligns with the earlier dialogue about puppies. It also mentions Speaker A's enjoyment of cooking and suggests grilled asparagus with lemon, connecting to the context where Speaker A offers to make grilled asparagus. Additionally, Speaker A's interest in cooking, particularly fajitas, is relevant to the discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT regarding pairing grilled asparagus with fajitas. Speaker B's interest in trying different cuisines and considering a career as a chef aligns with the conversation about recipes and cooking, specifically about asparagus and fajitas. The MEMORY is mostly well-structured, but some details, such as Speaker A's suggestion regarding working as a line cook, are not directly relevant to the immediate conversation, which slightly lowers the score. Overall, the MEMORY is helpful and provides a clear connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
