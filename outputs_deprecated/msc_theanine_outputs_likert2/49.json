Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B's interest in becoming a therapist stemmed from their mom being a nurse and busy with work. This led Speaker B to discuss the profession's ups and downs, including the concern about the cost of owning horses and considering the psychological aspects of horse ownership in relation to Freudian theories.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that can contribute to the conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It details Speaker B's motivation to become a therapist, connecting it to their mother's profession, which adds depth to their previous statements about wanting to help people. However, the MEMORY also includes information about \"the cost of owning horses\" and \"psychological aspects of horse ownership in relation to Freudian theories,\" which do not directly relate to the ongoing conversation about therapy in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. These aspects of the MEMORY don't seem directly relevant or naturally connected to the current dialogue, making it less helpful for generating the next response. Therefore, while there are elements in the MEMORY that are informative, overall, the connection and relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT are partially met."
