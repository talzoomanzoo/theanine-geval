Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play? \nSpeaker B: I don't know play instrument.

Still I didn't get right teacher. I'm jealous on you. I don't have like your dad.\nSpeaker A: what instrument have you been trying to learn?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys playing the drums and writing music in a band, which consists of 4 members including their best friend who is the singer.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information about Speaker A's musical background and interests, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A discusses playing drums and learning from their father. This connection is somewhat helpful for Speaker B, providing context for potential topics of discussion, such as the band and concert planning. However, the MEMORY information about Speaker A's concert plans, while related to their music hobby, doesn't directly relate to the specific conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about learning instruments or seeing live bands. The MEMORY also includes details about Speaker B's interest in cooking Italian dishes, which isn't linked to the context or causally tied to the conversation about rock music and learning instruments, making this part less relevant to generating a next response in the ongoing dialogue."
