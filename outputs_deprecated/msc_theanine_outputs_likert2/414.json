Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin!\nSpeaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name? \nSpeaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls! \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A used to have a Mini car, which is smaller compared to Speaker B's Subaru, but now Speaker A has a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Marmalade. \nSpeaker A usually leaves their cats with a friend while traveling, but now Speaker B ends up taking care of stray cats brought home by kids. \nSpeaker A has a kitten from their cat and enjoys taking them on trips, and Speaker B is excited for the trip and looking forward to trying the best iced tea.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the fact that Speaker A has cats and was considering naming a new kitten Marmalade, which aligns with the discussion about naming the kitten Pumpkin instead. However, the memory contains other information that is not directly relevant to the current dialogue, such as cars, traveling habits, and Speaker B taking care of stray cats, which do not directly connect with the current conversation about naming the kitten. Additionally, while the memory provides background context, it lacks a clear causal or relevant link to why Speaker A loves pumpkin spice or how Ginger connects to it, both of which are central to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT's unfolding."
