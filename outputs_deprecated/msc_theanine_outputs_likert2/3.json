Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break, which is why Speaker B dyed their hair with henna and enjoys experimenting with different hair colors. Speaker A, a retired librarian, used to have quiet spring breaks, but now recommends the book \"Beautiful Ruins\" by Jess Walter for a beach visit.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY does not provide much relevant information for generating a response in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. There is some connection between the memory and the dialogue context's mention of books, as Speaker A is a retired librarian and recommends a book, but this isnâ€™t directly helpful in formulating a response to Speaker B's question about reading any good books lately. The part about Speaker B being excited about Easter weekend and spring break and experimenting with hair colors does not relate to the current context and provides no relevant support for generating the next response. Additionally, the memory lacks structure and natural flow between the pieces of information about Speaker A and Speaker B. The overall relevancy to the current dialogue is minimal, and thus it earns a score of 2."
