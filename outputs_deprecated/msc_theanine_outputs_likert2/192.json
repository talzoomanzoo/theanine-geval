Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make?\nSpeaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it.\nSpeaker A: I would love to, I enjoy cooking so maybe you can teach me to make it, too?\nSpeaker B: Yeah definitely! I know you like hot foods, so if you learn and can make them fresh it will taste amazing. Have you tried any new foods lately?\nSpeaker A: Not any new foods, but I did try a new food truck near me that was delicious! It was street tacos and you could pick from barbacoa, chicken, and steak for the protein. Do you like Mexican food? \nSpeaker B: Oh god I do love Mexican food. That was be so hard to pick because they're all so good! Did they have al pastor by any chance? I loved marinated pork tacos.\nSpeaker A: unfortunately no, but I can ask them if they plan to get it in the future. I had one of each and they were all good in their own way. Have you ever had Birra tacos? I'd love to try those next.\nSpeaker B: I've never had birra tacos, what are those? They sound intriguing.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally. Speaker B, on the other hand, is a pro snowboarder who enjoys snowboarding, surfing, and skateboarding.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Birria tacos are a traditional Mexican dish made with seasoned goat or beef meat in a flavorful broth. They're typically served with melted cheese on a crispy tortilla. They're definitely worth trying!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about Speaker A's interest in cooking, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as cooking and trying new foods are being discussed. However, the mention of Speaker B being a pro snowboarder with interests in snowboarding, surfing, and skateboarding is unrelated to the topic of food and cooking that dominates the conversation. The connection between the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY is weak due to this unrelated information, which does not support generating a relevant next response. As such, the MEMORY is mostly unhelpful in aiding the continuation of the conversation about cooking and trying new foods."
