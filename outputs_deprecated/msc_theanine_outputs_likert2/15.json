Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has known how to swim since the age of 5 and offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\nSpeaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming. \nSpeaker B does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies, which causes Speaker A to plan a snorkeling trip and sign up for several trips. As a result, Speaker A is planning a snorkeling trip and wants to travel to the Caribbean for their next trip.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "No, I've never been to the Caribbean, but it sounds like a fantastic place to visit. I'm looking forward to learning how to swim and programming with your guidance.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It confirms Speaker B's desire to learn to swim, which matches the current conversation about swimming lessons. It also mentions Speaker A's offer to teach swimming, which aligns with the dialogue where Speaker A offers help. Furthermore, Speaker A's excitement about traveling to the Caribbean is reflected in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT when they mention their next trip.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY also contains some extraneous and unconnected details. It mentions programming lessons and punk music, which is partially relevant since Speaker A talks about a playlist, but doesn't directly relate to the conversation about swimming and the Caribbean trip. Additionally, it mentions snorkeling trips and a passion for swimming movies, which were not part of the dialogue so far, making these details less relevant for generating the next response. The sequence of events and their causality mentioned (e.g., planning snorkeling trips due to a love for swimming movies) could be clearer and more aligned with the context provided."
