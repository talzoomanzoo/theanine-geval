Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?\nSpeaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping?\nSpeaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp?\nSpeaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is away from their child and glad that the pets are with them. Speaker B expresses concern about leaving a kitten alone during their family camping adventures. Speaker B is considering calling in sick to work to go to the zoo with their child. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo. \n\nSpeaker A suggests taking the pets to the zoo and mentions that most major cities have good zoos. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities. Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys. Speaker A has a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo, particularly to see the tiger named Joshua.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be helpful in generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It indicates that Speaker B is a parent and has an interest in taking their daughter to the zoo, which might relate to family activities such as camping mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, Speaker B's concern over the kitten during camping might hint at their preference towards family activities, which could relate back to camping preferences. However, the connection to camping is somewhat indirect and the MEMORY contains more information about Speaker A's interest in zoos, which doesn't directly contribute to the current dialogue about camping. While there are some potential links, the MEMORY does not provide strong, consistent causality or direct relevancy to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
