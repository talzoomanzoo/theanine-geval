Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods.\nSpeaker B: Oh that sounds fun! What is it about?\nSpeaker A: Black Widow is one of the character in the Marvel Avengers movies. Like Thor and Captain America. Have you seen any of those movies?\nSpeaker B: No I haven't seen any of those. What foods did you eat while watching the movie?\nSpeaker A: Wow, there are so many of the movies out there. Don't go see Black Widow without watching Avengers first. I had an amazing steak and vegetables on the side that were delicious. What is you favorite food? \nSpeaker B: Oh ok I definitely will watch those first! I love both steak and vegetables! I am a real foodie and love just about everything that isn't too strange to try lol.\nSpeaker A: Oh wow! Do you like sushi? I love it but the sea urchin is a little crazy lol. Have you ever eaten sea urchin?\nSpeaker B: I have never tried sea urchin or sushi but I do like crab legs and shrimp! Do you ever consider any foods to be good for healing? I find that you do healing very fascinating!\nSpeaker A: Yes, in fact I consider almost all foods to either be healing, harmful or neutral. In my opinion people should choose foods based on how they want to feel. Sushi is fresh and healthy so I considerate it to be very healing.\nSpeaker B: That is very wise thinking. Which vegetables do you feel are the best for healing? Are there any that should be avoided?\nSpeaker A: I feel that most leafy green vegetables are healthy, but it depends on the specific person's needs. For example some people need to avoid nightshades, like potatoes, etc. while other people can eat them without any problems. Overall, a diet with a variety of colors is good when it comes to vegetables\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is interested in trying healing methods mentioned by Speaker A. Speaker B's sister joins them on the water and takes a nap in a hammock. Speaker B enjoys sailing during the summer for the best \"scenery\" and has a houseboat where they spend time with their family.\n\nSpeaker A recommends self-massage, essential oils, reiki, meditation, and self-awareness for healing. Speaker A finds being on the water therapeutic and relaxing. Speaker B goes sailing during the summer for the best \"scenery\" and enjoys sailing, spending time with family on a houseboat.\n\nSpeaker A is involved in healing work and mentions hot latina salsa. Speaker A and their brother enjoy going to a Brazilian steakhouse for dinner. Speaker B has one sibling, a little brother, who enjoys Brazilian food, specifically steak.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That makes a lot of sense. I'll definitely keep that in mind when choosing my vegetables. Do you have a favorite leafy green vegetable that you find particularly healing or beneficial?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could help a language model generate a coherent response in the context of Speaker A and Speaker B's conversation about food and healing. For example, it mentions Speaker B's interest in healing methods, which aligns with the discussion of healing foods. It also notes Speaker A's involvement in healing work, which could be relevant when they talk about foods being healing. However, the details about sailing and siblings, while they offer context about Speaker B's interests and family, are not directly connected to the immediate topic of conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the mention of \"hot latina salsa\" feels out of place and unrelated to the ongoing dialogue about food and healing, reducing the cohesiveness of the MEMORY. As such, while parts of the MEMORY are helpful, others are less relevant, limiting the overall helpfulness in this specific dialogue context."
