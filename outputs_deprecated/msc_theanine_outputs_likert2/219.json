Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself!\nSpeaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is interested in helping Speaker A with their penguins at the zoo and working with animals. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to have a house concert with their pets, sharing a love for music.\nSpeaker B inquires if Speaker A has experience with pet raccoons after Speaker A's pet raccoon, Journey, enjoys eating pizza. Speaker A expresses interest in having a pet raccoon after having a friend who found baby raccoons.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information, particularly the detail about Speaker A's pet raccoon, Journey, enjoying eating pizza, which directly relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Journey eats a whole piece of pizza. However, the rest of the MEMORY about Speaker B's interest in helping with penguins and their shared love for music isn't directly linked to the current conversation about how to prevent Journey from eating food. The sentences in the MEMORY are connected to some extent, mentioning Speaker B's inquiry about raccoons which ties back to Speaker A's experience with Journey. But the connection and relevance could be stronger or more focused to support the conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT more effectively."
