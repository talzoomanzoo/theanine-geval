Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is planning to retire down south on a beach for warm weather, having visited Alaska and describing it as beautiful, and suggesting cheap flights to Anchorage. This led Speaker B to find flights that work for their schedule and price, resulting in them planning to visit Speaker A in a couple of weeks. Speaker A has then invited Speaker B to visit them and is excited about the upcoming trip. \nSpeaker B, who enjoys warm days, cool mornings, and eating poached eggs, is now interested in visiting Alaska and considering getting blackout curtains due to the midnight sun. This interest led Speaker A to invite Speaker B to visit and mention looking into flights. As a result, Speaker B is now planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in activities like going to a concert, petting a wolf, and going on a glacier tour. \nSpeaker A, who drives a smart car and used to have a long commute in Alaska, has visited the state and found it beautiful, suggesting cheap flights to Anchorage. This suggestion led Speaker B to find suitable flights, resulting in them planning to visit Speaker A soon. Speaker A is looking forward to the visit and has extended an invitation to Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I found some good flights that work for my schedule. I'm excited to visit you soon!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a substantial amount of information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and explains the development of the conversation regarding the travel plans between Speaker A and Speaker B. It includes details such as Speaker A's invitation to Speaker B, the search for flights, and the anticipation of the upcoming visit. The connection between the past interactions (e.g., Speaker A's suggestion of cheap flights and the invitation) and the current context (Speaker A asking about tickets) is clearly demonstrated. The MEMORY does indicate Speaker B's interests and plans, like activities they plan to engage in during the visit, which is helpful in understanding the background of their interaction. However, the MEMORY could be slightly more concise as it is somewhat repetitive in detailing the trip planning. Overall, it effectively informs the language model, representing Speaker B, to generate an appropriate response in alignment with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
