Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well?\nSpeaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes?\nSpeaker A: I want to take some martial art classes at school next year. What do you sggest I try?\nSpeaker B: I mean I always recommend Karate since that's what I study! I can bring you by the dojo sometime if you want to see what it is like. \nSpeaker A: OMG!! That would be so awesome, Yes please.  When is a good time for you?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, who has a background in football and karate, signed up for classes at the local college and is currently a lifeguard at the beach. Speaker B is considering a career change to the IT sector due to their computer skills and the growing demand for employees in that sector. Additionally, Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's background in karate, which is directly related to the conversation about martial arts. It also mentions that Speaker B holds a green belt in karate, which may reinforce their credibility in recommending karate to Speaker A. However, other details such as Speaker B's involvement in football, their work as a lifeguard, and considerations about a career change to IT are not directly relevant to the dialogue about martial arts classes. Additionally, the connection between these activities and the main topic is not explicitly stated, which slightly reduces the natural flow and causality of the information provided."
