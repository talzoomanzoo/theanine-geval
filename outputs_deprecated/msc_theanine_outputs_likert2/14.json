Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, who does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies, wants Speaker A to teach them how to swim and programming. Speaker B also enjoys cruising in their car while listening to punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming. On the other hand, Speaker A, who enjoys cruising and has a favorite club in school, causes Speaker A to plan snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination. This leads to Speaker A and Speaker B discussing the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That would be awesome! I'll make sure there's some time for swimming and programming on the cruise too.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker B's interest in swimming and their desire to be taught by Speaker A, which aligns with the context where Speaker B expresses interest in learning to swim. The mention of cruising and listening to punk music is somewhat relevant, as Speaker A mentions playlists for the meetup. However, the MEMORY introduces unrelated or confusing elements, such as Speaker A planning snorkeling and having a favorite club, which do not clearly connect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, while the MEMORY contains some relevant details, it lacks clear and natural connections between all pieces of information."
