Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, a high school student preparing for college, works at a diner at night but is considering giving up their job to focus on lab work and school. Additionally, Speaker B works on weekends at a research lab, displaying an interest in neuroscience. Speaker A offers to take Sparky for a walk to help out and spend time with the dog, as Speaker B's dog is deaf and needs to be kept on a lead due to recall difficulties.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information about Speaker B's situation that is relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT regarding lab work. It indicates that Speaker B is a high school student who works at a research lab on weekends and is considering shifting focus from their diner job to lab work and school, showcasing their interest in neuroscience. This is pertinent to the conversation about lab work, as it reinforces Speaker B's engagement and interest in this field, helping to inform a proper next response. The detail about Speaker A's offer to walk Speaker B's deaf dog, Sparky, is somewhat tangential to the immediate conversation but still contributes to understanding their existing relationship and support system. The memory is mostly coherently connected, though the inclusion of the dog-related sentence feels slightly less connected to the main topic of lab work."
