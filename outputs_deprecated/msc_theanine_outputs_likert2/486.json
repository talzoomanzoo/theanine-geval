Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A, a recent high school graduate on a cross-country journey, is looking for a job and new camping gear, specifically a hammock. This is because Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\n2. Speaker A, a recent high school graduate on a cross-country journey, is looking for a job and new camping gear, specifically a hammock. This change occurred after Speaker A acquired a portable hammock for the hike and asked Speaker B to bring theirs.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information which can be useful for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It presents relevant information about Speaker A's circumstances: the fact that they are a recent high school graduate, are on a cross-country journey, and are looking for a job at a grocery store as well as seeking new camping gear, particularly a hammock. There is a consistency and connection between finding a job at a grocery store and the hiking/camping theme, which is relevant given the context of being offered a job at a grocery store. However, the causal link between Speaker B and Speaker A's adventure regarding the hammock could be more explicit. The score of 4 reflects that while the MEMORY is informative and relevant, there is a slight gap in the clarity of causality between the events and the current context."
