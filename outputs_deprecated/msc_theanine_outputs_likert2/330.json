Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume.\nSpeaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment. \nSpeaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think?\nSpeaker A: It depends on what you are trying to make out of origami, you can make some super complicated stuff, there's actually special paper that you can get for it! You may have seen origami be used in the hospital for some breathing aperatus!\nSpeaker B: That's amazing. I had no idea, but that totally makes sense. Do you have to practice a lot -- sort of a use it or lose it kind of thing?\nSpeaker A: Yea, I think for the more complicated origami it's kind of a use it or lose it but for the simple stuff you can usually take a couple months of and still remember to do it! Did you see origami in Japan?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next and learned origami by themselves in their craft room. Speaker A volunteers at a hospital and enjoys making origami crafts, specifically a 3D modular swan with glue, and offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks. Speaker B keeps a turquoise lotus origami on their desk from Japan and enjoys origami, having tried making a Lotus flower successfully.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I saw some beautiful origami pieces in Japan. The attention to detail and precision in their folding was truly remarkable.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A offering to teach Speaker B origami and specifics about the type of origami Speaker A enjoys making (e.g., 3D modular swan with glue) and their interests in trying a lotus origami next. However, the detail about Speaker B having a turquoise lotus origami from Japan and enjoying origami is not as directly related to the current context of the conversation, which is more focused on discussing the difficulty of origami and potential practice requirements. The sentences in the MEMORY are somewhat connected and give a sense of Speaker A's and Speaker B's shared interest, but they do not strongly develop the past interactions or causality in the dialogue effectively."
