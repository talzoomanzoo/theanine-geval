Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on!\nSpeaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar.\nSpeaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general?\nSpeaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts.\nSpeaker A: How's learning to bake going in general, especially now that you're off desserts?\nSpeaker B: I one of those people how have to fail a couple of times before I get the hang of it, but I'm getting there.  Have you and the kids had any chance to go skiing lately?\nSpeaker A: Water skiing? Yes, last weekend. It was so much fun!\nSpeaker B: (sorry my typing sucks)  That's awesome. I wish had access to a boat, but who knows, maybe one day. \nSpeaker A: Boating is so fun. You could go wakeboarding more often if you had your own boat. And no more boat rental fees or hassle.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, who values following their passions for snowboarding and music, expresses interest in trying water skiing next. Speaker A, who has been water skiing for 15 years and has 3 kids who also water ski, is excited to join Speaker B's family for a water skiing trip and wants to learn from Speaker A's kids.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Having your own boat for water sports sounds amazing. Maybe one day I'll be able to experience that too.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant context about Speaker B's interest in water skiing, which complements their discussion about skiing in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY mainly focuses on introducing Speaker A's background in water skiing and their kids, which doesn't directly connect to the current conversations about baking and boating. The information about Speaker A wanting to join Speaker B's family for a water skiing trip and learning from Speaker A's kids does not clearly link to the ongoing DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where the main focus is on cooking, baking, sugar, and potential boating experiences. Overall, the MEMORY lacks natural connections and causal relationships that would clearly aid in generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
