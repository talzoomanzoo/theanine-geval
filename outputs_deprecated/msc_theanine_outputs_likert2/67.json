Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play? \nSpeaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is in a band where they play the drums and write music, with 4 members including the singer who is their best friend. This suggests Speaker A is in a band and plays music, possibly a musician. Additionally, Speaker A's band visited Italy, Uzbekistan, and smaller countries in Central and South America.\n\nSpeaker A grew up in California on the beach and loves morning surfing, which indicates that they enjoy surfing and music as a way to escape from daily life. As a result, Speaker A is good at surfing, nicknamed \"lil fishie\", and enjoys eating fish, particularly salmon or tuna. \n\nSpeaker B is a passionate cook who enjoys making Italian dishes like pasta, risotto, and pizza.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides somewhat helpful context for generating a next response, especially for Speaker A, as it mentions Speaker A's involvement in a band and their musical interests, which can be useful in a conversation about music instruments. The information about Speaker B being a passionate cook could potentially guide a shift in the dialogue towards discussing cooking or food preferences. However, not all sentences are directly relevant or necessary for the immediate dialogue context. The details about traveling or surfing, while interesting, may not directly assist in continuing the conversation based on the current dialogue context about music. Thus, the MEMORY is moderately connected but not optimally aligned with the immediate context."
