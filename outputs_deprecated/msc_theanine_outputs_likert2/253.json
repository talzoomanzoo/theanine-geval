Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\nSpeaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\nSpeaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\n\nMEMORY:\n- Speaker B's father was involved in producing horror movies, which influenced Speaker B's favorite genre. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\n- Speaker B has two kids and enjoys painting and taking naps. Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them. Speaker A also likes mid-century design and is a fan of horror movies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for Speaker B to generate a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The fact that Speaker B's father was involved in producing horror movies and that Speaker B creates horror movies with their father is relevant to the current conversation where Speaker A is asking about Speaker B's experiences in movie production. It provides background to the interests and experiences that Speaker B might draw from. However, the MEMORY also contains some unrelated details, such as Speaker B's kids or the fact that Speaker A likes mid-century design, which may not be directly useful for the immediate continuation of this conversation. Additionally, the connection between the sentences in MEMORY could be clearer to fully demonstrate causality or a natural progression of ideas."
