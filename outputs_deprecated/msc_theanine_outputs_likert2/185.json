Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally. This is similar to how Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe. Speaker B's grandmother was the matriarch of the family, known for cooking large meals for family gatherings. \nSpeaker A, who is part of a music band and plays the drums, loves making food for others just like how Speaker B enjoys snowboarding, surfing, and skateboarding.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I can definitely make the garlic chicken! As for spicy foods, I've taught myself to make spicy shrimp tacos and a fiery chili con carne. How about you, any favorite spicy dishes you enjoy making?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that supports the generation of a proper response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes a connection between Speaker A's interest in cooking and following recipes, and Speaker B's appreciation for cooking for loved ones, including a specific reference to their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe. This is relevant to Speaker A's inquiry about making garlic chicken. Although the details about Speaker A's musical interests and Speaker B's other hobbies (snowboarding, surfing, and skateboarding) are less relevant to the immediate conversation about cooking, the MEMORY overall provides a helpful basis for understanding the shared interest in food and family recipes, enabling Speaker B to potentially respond with related personal anecdotes or tips about making spicy foods. The sentences are naturally connected, making the context clear and meaningful."
