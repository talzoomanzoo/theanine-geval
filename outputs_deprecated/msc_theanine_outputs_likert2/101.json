Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends?\nSpeaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do.\nSpeaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is unsure about what else there is to do in Alaska besides hiking. Speaker B is going to Alaska for a vacation in two weeks and has some experience with flying on airplanes. Speaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great idea! Camping under the stars in Alaska would be an incredible experience.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful context for understanding Speaker B's situation and interests in the conversation. It mentions that Speaker B is unsure about other activities besides hiking, which connects to Speaker B's current deliberation about sledding. It also notes that Speaker B is going to Alaska for a vacation, which aligns with the current discussion about trip planning. Additionally, it highlights that Speaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities, supporting Speaker A's suggestion about star gazing. However, the MEMORY could be more helpful if it specifically addressed the topic of day and night cycles in Alaska or if it mentioned any previous discussions about sledding or camping. The information about Speaker B's experience with flying and the fact that they are planning a trip together, while somewhat relevant, does not significantly aid in generating the next response based on the current dialogue context. Overall, the MEMORY is moderately connected and relevant, but could be more focused and causally linked to the current conversation."
