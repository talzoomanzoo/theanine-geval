Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok? \nSpeaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule, which causes Speaker A to enjoy the interaction with people at work and the variety of experiences that come with it.\n\n2. Speaker A owns a restaurant and recently experienced a fire incident but managed to put it out, leading to Speaker A finding it very busy working there. Additionally, Speaker A works at the restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n\n3. Speaker A's restaurant plays a mix of songs, mainly easy listening, to create a relaxing environment for diners, which is why Speaker A's schedule at the restaurant includes working doubles on Saturdays and 8-hour shifts on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker A's work life, which connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about the excitement of trying a new dish at the restaurant. The MEMORY highlights Speaker A's enjoyment in working at the restaurant, mentioning interactions with people, getting free meals, and taking home leftover baked goods, which is relevant to the context where Speaker A talks about trying the new dish for free. However, the information about a fire incident and specific work schedules doesn't directly enhance the immediate dialogue context. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it focused more on Speaker A's enthusiasm for the food or menu changes, aligning more clearly with the current conversation. The details provided are somewhat scattered and lack a smooth connection to the topic of the new menu item, somewhat reducing the overall helpfulness."
