Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet? \nSpeaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is interested in adopting a rescue kitten and has a parrot named Tasha who speaks Mandarin. Speaker B has two sick kitties and recently received a rescue, and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities. Speaker A has a pet parrot named Tasha and has red hair that makes them stand out. Speaker B has an older mellow cat and is concerned about training the new energetic kittens.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be helpful for Speaker A to generate a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes details about Speaker A's interest in adopting a rescue kitten, which aligns with the context of discussing kitten names. Additionally, Speaker B's mention of having a rescue and considering Mandarin names for kittens ties into the ongoing conversation about naming them, providing a basis for Speaker A to respond. However, much of the MEMORY's content is not directly related to the specific DIALOGUE CONTEXT or naming kittens (e.g., information about Speaker A's parrot, Speaker A's red hair, or Speaker B's older cat), which limits its overall helpfulness. The sentences are not very cohesively connected in a way that enhances the current conversation about kitten names, thereby reducing the potential score."
