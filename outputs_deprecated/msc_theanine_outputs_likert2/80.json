Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\nSpeaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call!\nSpeaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip? \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is a librarian and loves kids, mentioning having 3 children. This makes Speaker A busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. Consequently, Speaker B, who has a lot of kids all grown up with kids of their own, enjoys spending time with their grandkids at the park. This led Speaker B to take their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I've been thinking about it, and I believe it could be a wonderful tradition for all of us. The kids seemed to enjoy it, and it's a great way to bond with nature.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant context for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It reveals that Speaker A is a librarian who loves kids but is busy with work, which ties in with the mention of their work hours in the conversation. The MEMORY also details Speaker Bâ€™s fondness for spending time with their grandkids and introduces the idea of a fishing trip, which relates to the annual fishing trip mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The connection between Speaker B's enjoyment of time with grandkids and their experiences with the fishing trip adds depth to their character and motivation for suggesting the annual fishing trip. The MEMORY could be improved slightly by clarifying whether Speaker A is interested in taking a similar fishing trip or simply listening to Speaker B's experiences, but overall it provides a helpful framework for understanding the exchange."
