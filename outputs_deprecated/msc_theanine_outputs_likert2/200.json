Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college?\nSpeaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position. \nSpeaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it?\nSpeaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \nSpeaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket while majoring in Humanities, but now plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week. They are a member of a soccer team and enjoy playing in tournaments. Speaker A enjoys watching international teams play and is a fan of Arsenal. Speaker A enjoys playing soccer and joked about treating Speaker B to lunch, hinting that Speaker B is currently low on cash. Both Speaker A and Speaker B have arachnophobia and fear spiders.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That would be a cool job, you definitely have the passion for it!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that can aid in generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes details about Speaker A's current involvement in soccer, which could be relevant to the conversation about soccer. For instance, mentioning that Speaker A plays as a striker and has an upcoming match could be helpful if the conversation shifts to Speaker A's current soccer activities. However, certain details in the MEMORY, such as both speakers' fear of spiders or Speaker A's past work at a supermarket, are less relevant to the current conversation about soccer and potential careers in sports commentary. Additionally, the MEMORY could be improved by organizing the details in a more coherent manner, enhancing the connection between the past events and the current dialogue."
