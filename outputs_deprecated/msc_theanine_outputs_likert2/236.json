Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet? \nSpeaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name?\nSpeaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \nSpeaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along!\nSpeaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them.\nSpeaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me!\nSpeaker A: Hahaha. Yes I agree its too hot to get a long hike in. I've been on some short ones, but the bugs eat me alive. I like to hike in the fall when the bugs are dying off and its a little cooler.\nSpeaker B: Ah yes, that's my favorite time of year. Oh and speaking of Tasha, I'm still amazed she knows Mandarin. Have you been learning more of the language?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has two sick kitties and recently received a rescue, which causes Speaker A to have a parrot named Tasha and be interested in adopting a rescue kitten. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I've been trying to pick up a few basic phrases here and there, but Tasha is definitely the expert in our house!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information that can be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly in connecting the topic of kitten adoption with Speaker A's interest, since Speaker B's actions have influenced Speaker A's decision. However, the connection between the rescue cats and the parrot named Tasha is not presented clearly and seems somewhat unnatural. The MEMORY mentions Speaker B considering giving the kittens Mandarin names, which does relate somewhat to Speaker A's mention of the parrot knowing Mandarin, but this connection is not made explicit within the MEMORY. Overall, the MEMORY has potential but does not fully demonstrate the relevance or natural causality needed for a higher score."
