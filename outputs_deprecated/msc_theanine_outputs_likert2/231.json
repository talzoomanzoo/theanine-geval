Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet? \nSpeaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name?\nSpeaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a pet parrot named Tasha and has red hair that makes them stand out. They are interested in adopting a rescue kitten named Zhao. \nSpeaker A is a country girl who loves animals and is a lacto-ovo vegetarian. This made them react positively when Speaker B suggested giving the rescue kittens Mandarin names based on their personalities. \nSpeaker B lives in the city they grew up in, loves animals, and has a cat that recently had a kitten. This situation causes Speaker B to have two sick kitties and recently received a rescue, leading them to look for someone to adopt one of the cats.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's wonderful to hear! I'm sure you'll find the perfect little companion to join your family soon.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the fact that Speaker B recently received a rescue kitten and suggested giving the rescue kittens Mandarin names based on their personalities. This connects with the current discussion about kitten names in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Moreover, both speakers' mutual love for animals is evident, which could offer insights into their interactions. However, several details in the MEMORY, such as the information about Speaker A's parrot, their red hair, and being a lacto-ovo vegetarian, or Speaker B living in the city they grew up in, do not significantly contribute to generating the next response in the ongoing conversation. While these details expand on the speakers' backgrounds, they are not directly relevant or causally linked to the context of naming kittens. Additionally, the MEMORY does not clearly outline the causality between past and present dialogue interactions, which affects the overall connectivity and relevancy."
