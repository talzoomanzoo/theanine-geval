Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\nSpeaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys nature and works with animals, which is why they are an artist who walks through nature for work. Currently, Speaker B is re-reading 'Redwall' by Brian Jacques, a favorite book from their childhood. Speaker A, who is a fan of the Game of Thrones series and enjoys audiobooks, recommends \"A Game of Thrones\" by George R.R. Martin. Speaker A, a city dweller who walks to work, emphasizes the importance of proper form in exercise to prevent injuries.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information about Speaker B's interest in nature, which can be linked to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A speaks about a nature walk. This could help in constructing a response that connects to Speaker B’s appreciation and work related to nature. However, the additional details about Speaker B’s reading habits and Speaker A's interests, while providing context about their personalities, do not directly contribute to generating a response related to the current topic of the nature walk. Additionally, the sentences in MEMORY are not consistently interconnected in a manner that clearly demonstrates causality or direct relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
