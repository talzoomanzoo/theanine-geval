Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive.\nSpeaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price?\nSpeaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music\nSpeaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B have a friendly interaction and part ways on a positive note. They both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\nSpeaker A has never been to college and values the peaceful life of working on the farm. Speaker A mentions that Speaker B's kids could try milking cows on the farm, which Speaker B finds amusing. They discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\nSpeaker B believes that luxurious items distract from the value of their family. Speaker A bought 50 lotto tickets with different numbers to increase their chances of winning.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That would be a nice surprise! Who knows, maybe one of those 50 lotto tickets will bring me some luck.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several relevant and helpful pieces of information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It begins by establishing a friendly relationship between the speakers and mentions that they both bought lotto tickets, which directly ties into Speaker B's comment about winning the lotto. It also includes potential topics that can be naturally woven into the discussion, such as different strategies for playing the lotto and potential outcomes if they win, which can be relevant to enhancing the dialogue about the expense of the iPhone. Moreover, the MEMORY touches on Speaker B's belief about luxurious items, which connects to the conversation concerning the expense and value of the new iPhone. The MEMORY maintains a coherent flow, indicating the development of past interactions, thus providing helpful context for generating a relevant and engaging next response. However, some parts of MEMORY, like Speaker A's views on the peaceful life of working on the farm, feel less connected to the immediate conversation about the iPhone purchase and its cost."
