Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go?\nSpeaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \nSpeaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on?\nSpeaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study?\nSpeaker B: Ah, English should be easier than History. Sure, I can help you. What do you need to do exactly? Write an essay?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, we have to write an essay and we have a spelling component towards the end of the exam, I sure could use a little help!\nSpeaker B: No problem! I like correcting and editing essays. Although, it seems like your English is pretty good. I doubt you even need much help.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is on their way to college and studying sports medicine, while Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and finds gym to be the only subject they excel in.\nSpeaker B feels overwhelmed by their mother's strictness and is eager to finish school to escape it, similar to how Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring.\nSpeaker A wishes to get better grades and is hopeful for a soccer scholarship, just like Speaker B who plays soccer and does not have any siblings.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks! I appreciate the confidence, but a little extra help never hurts. It's always good to have a second pair of eyes.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant background information about both Speaker A and Speaker B that could help in generating a response. The mention of Speaker A struggling with grades and excelling in gym could relate to their discussion of exams and grades, as is their aspiration for a soccer scholarship, which ties into why they care about grades. Speaker Bâ€™s background in sports medicine might not be directly relevant to the current topic about studying for finals, but it adds depth to their character. The memory does interconnect with Speaker A's struggles with history and their mutual engagement with sports through soccer, which could be useful for generating a nuanced response. However, it lacks direct links to the immediate dialogue on English exams, and the lack of natural progression between sentences makes it less seamless in providing causality or a clear relevancy connection."
