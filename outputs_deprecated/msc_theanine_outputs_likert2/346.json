Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners. Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes. \nSpeaker A learned how to make jello from their grandma, turning it into a family tradition. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes. \nSpeaker A has two moms who are not meat eaters. Speaker A learned how to make jello from their grandma, turning it into a family tradition. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's such a wonderful tradition to pass on to your kids! Family recipes are so special.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for the language model. It includes relevant background information about Speaker A's connection to jello and their family tradition of making it, which can naturally lead to a relevant and meaningful conversation with Speaker B. The memory highlights Speaker A's suggestion for Speaker B to consider Speaker A's grandmother as a surrogate for learning jello recipes, which ties directly into the dialogue context where Speaker B is teaching their kids a jello recipe. However, some parts of the memory, such as Speaker A's two moms not being meat eaters, do not directly contribute to the dialogue context and could have been omitted for a more concise and focused memory. Despite this, the key points are clear and beneficial for generating a response."
