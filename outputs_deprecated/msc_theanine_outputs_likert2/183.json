Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know. \nSpeaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like.\nSpeaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too.\nSpeaker B: Nice! Is anyone coming with you?\nSpeaker A: Just my doggy Drunky.  You never know,  I might meet a nice lady out there. \nSpeaker B: Totally.  There will be a bunch of women there and it'll be easy to strike up conversations.  Just be confident and I'm sure you could walk away with a bunch of numbers.\nSpeaker A: Oh, I definitely will. Thanks for the motivation. Is this going to me your first festival?\nSpeaker B: No, I used to go to them all the time.  This will be my first one in a while and probably my last since my wife and I are about to have our baby.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is not going out drinking much due to their wife's pregnancy. Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day. Speaker B's wife is pregnant and has three more months to go until the due date. \nSpeaker A owns a Subaru Legacy and mentions having a baby on the way. Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's exciting, it will be a memorable experience for you before the baby arrives. Enjoy the festival while you can!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker B's situation, primarily focusing on Speaker Bâ€™s wife's pregnancy and how it affects their social activities. This context explains why Speaker B might consider attending a local festival for just a day and mentions their limited ability to go out, contributing to their conversation about festivals in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY also notes that Speaker A and Speaker B have discussed the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby, which could be relevant to their future plans.\n\nHowever, some parts of MEMORY are less helpful for generating a response to the immediate conversation. For example, Speaker A owning a Subaru Legacy or mentioning that they also have a baby on the way seems disconnected from the given context, as there's no mention of Speaker A's baby in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY lacks clear causality or development of interactions that would fully integrate with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, leading to a moderate score."
