    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it! Thank you for the recommendation.\nSpeaker B: Of course. I recommend that movie to everyone I meet. I think I've watched it over one hundred times. So what is the next movie on your list to watch soon?\nSpeaker A: Yeah it was great and I will also recommend to people when they ask what movie is good. So next is another one you recommended which is coming to America. What’s the next movie your going to watch? \nSpeaker B: There is a horror genre movie that was released just this week which I'm going to watch tonight. It is called \"Girl Next.\"\nSpeaker A: Oh that sounds interesting, I will look into that and put it on my list. How has your job been going? Is there where you get all these great ideas for what to watch?  \nSpeaker B: My Film Studies professor job has been going absolutely great lately. I love all my students, because they really get into the lectures and ask lots of questions. Yes, my job requires me to watch movies all the time, so that is how I find the best ones. Is your programmer job going all right lately?\nSpeaker A: That sounds amazing. Super lucky to have students that really enjoy what they are learning about and I’m sure that’s down to the way you teach and what you teach them. I’m so glad it is all going well for you. Yeah it is going much better now, I’m really getting in the swing of things thank you for asking. \nSpeaker B: You're welcome. So, returning to the subject of Pulp Fiction, did you think it was funny? Did you think it was too violent for kids to watch?\nSpeaker A: Yeah there was some funny parts in that movie. I kinda think it may be a little to violent for kids, but I would just allow it to each parent to decide I would probably let my grandkids watch. What is your opinion? \nSpeaker B: I agree with you. As long as the parent can explain what's going on regarding the violence, and make sure the kid knows it is just a movie and not real life, I think most kids would be able to watch the movie without really being harmed or negatively influenced.\nSpeaker A: Yes exactly. I think all kids should learn that. I know my grandkids love to watch all genre’s of movies and I think kids should learn what they like to watch. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B used to teach Film Studies and carefully chooses what movies to watch, and Speaker B has a sister who shares the same opinion about age as Speaker A.\nSpeaker B just turned 40 and considers themselves too old for certain activities, but Speaker B allowed their kids to watch Disney, Pixar, and older films like screwball comedies from the '30s and '40s.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "It's great that your grandkids enjoy watching different genres of movies. It's important for kids to explore different types of films and find what they like.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's background in Film Studies and their approach to film viewing, which could be helpful for Speaker B in generating responses related to movies and age-appropriateness debates. It also provides some connection to Speaker A's opinion about age appropriateness with mentioning a sister who shares the same opinion, although this part is not explicitly discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the information about Speaker B's age and feeling too old for certain activities is less relevant and does not connect directly to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, there is partial relevance but also some disconnect or extraneous details, which reduces the overall helpfulness in this specific context."
