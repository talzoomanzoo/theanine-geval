Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet? \nSpeaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name?\nSpeaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \nSpeaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along!\nSpeaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them.\nSpeaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a pet parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten. Speaker A is a country girl who loves animals and is considering adopting a rescue kitten despite having a parrot. Speaker A is interested in training tips for the kittens and is open to adopting one despite having a parrot. Speaker B has an older mellow cat and is concerned about training the new energetic kittens.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights Speaker A's interest in adopting a rescue kitten despite already having a parrot named Tasha, which is relevant to the ongoing conversation about adopting animals. The MEMORY also mentions Speaker A's interest in training tips for the kittens, which could be relevant for future dialogues. However, the mention of Speaker B's older mellow cat and concerns about training new kittens does not directly connect with the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT or enhance the ongoing conversation about names for kittens and hiking. The connections and causality between the events are somewhat unclear, which affects the overall helpfulness of the MEMORY."
