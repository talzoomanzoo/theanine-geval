Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \nSpeaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with?\nSpeaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point.\nSpeaker A: Yes, it contains eggs.  I think you would do well with the fried rice. It's best to cook the rice the day before.  \nSpeaker B: I didn't know that. Why cook the rice beforehand? Is it better to age rice or something?\nSpeaker A: The rice needs to be cool before adding to the pan.  Are you able to take a passenger along in you truck?\nSpeaker B: Oh! That makes since. I didn't realize that the temperature made a difference when frying rice. As for the truck, Yes I can. But, depending on what company I'm working for at the time, they often set restrictions on passengers.\nSpeaker A: The rice tends to stick together if it's warm.  I would like to ride along with you sometime when you're able.\nSpeaker B: I actually have a scheduled haul for next Wednesday. Do you want to come along for that ride? It should take about five hours.\nSpeaker A: Sure, I'm free that day.  What time do I need to meet you?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, who lives in a rural area with a farm and can relate to cooking, causes Speaker A to be interested in running a business with their cooking skills. Speaker B, who is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker, also sparks Speaker A's interest in running a business with their cooking skills. \nSpeaker B, who does not cook but enjoys listening to country music and drives trucks for a living, also mentions having a farm with animals like chickens, ducks, pigs, goats, and growing crops like corn, strawberries, and pumpkins, which is a topic discussed by Speaker A who has 14 chickens and uses their eggs for baking.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "I'll pick you up at 8 am next Wednesday. It'll be a fun ride!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information regarding Speaker B's background and interests, which includes living in a rural area with a farm and not being a cook but interested in learning, which ties into the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where cooking, particularly using a pressure cooker and cooking rice, is the central theme. The fact that Speaker B drives trucks is also relevant given the conversation about taking a passenger in the truck. However, the MEMORY doesn't naturally connect completely with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the mention of Speaker A's potential business interest due to Speaker B's cooking interest, which isn't explicitly discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the information about Speaker B's farm animals and crops doesn't directly relate to the ongoing conversation about cooking or the truck ride but provides background on the speakerâ€™s rural lifestyle. The MEMORY could be more concise and better connected to be more immediately helpful in generating the next response in this specific dialogue."
