Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue.\nSpeaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad.\nSpeaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs!\nSpeaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours?\nSpeaker A: Ikea! Their furniture is not to expensive and they have all kinds of furniture that'll go with whatever scheme you're going for. What kind of patio furniture were you looking for? Like a barbeque, chairs, hammock? \nSpeaker B: I guess I was going to get like an umbrella table and some chairs to go with it or maybe even a screened in gazebo with a fire pit in the middle.\nSpeaker A: That's a great idea! Sounds like a very nice place for a barbeque. What were you planning on grilling for the barbeque? \nSpeaker B: I'll get the steaks to grill if you will bring the corn. And I have a request for you to play on the guitar, I know you are into country so if you could maybe play a song or two by Miranda Lambert, that would be awesome.\nSpeaker A: Of course! I love Miranda Lambert, any specific song requests? \nSpeaker B: Nothing specific I love all her songs, I think I'm going get off here so I can try to order that gazebo.\nSpeaker A: Good luck finding a gazebo!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B are both discussing furniture and home decor choices, which leads to them planning to meet up to discuss the furniture exchange. This results in Speaker A inviting Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a vague overview of the dialogue context, mentioning discussions about furniture and meeting up for an event involving music and food. However, it lacks specific details that would directly support generating an appropriate next response. The MEMORY does not clearly highlight key elements such as the specific furniture types discussed (like patio furniture and gazebo), the barbecue plans, or Speaker A's guitar playing with specific mentions of Miranda Lambert. Furthermore, the memory loses the natural progression of the conversation seen in the context and simplifies it to the point where the causality and relevancy are not clearly represented. Overall, MEMORY lacks precise information useful for furthering the dialogue effectively."
