Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on!\nSpeaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar.\nSpeaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general?\nSpeaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts.\nSpeaker A: How's learning to bake going in general, especially now that you're off desserts?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A's strong connection to jello, especially cherry flavor, stems from their grandma making it at family dinners, leading to Speaker A learning various jello recipes from their grandmother.\n2. Speaker A's favorite jello eating habit transformed into a family tradition after learning how to make jello from their grandma, suggesting Speaker B to involve their grandmother in learning jello recipes.\n3. Speaker A's upbringing by two non-meat eater moms shifted into a family tradition of learning jello recipes from their grandma.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains information about Speaker A's connection to jello, which could be relevant to the discussion since Speaker B is teaching their kids their grandmother's jello recipe. However, the MEMORY primarily focuses on Speaker A's background with jello rather than any interaction or connection with the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences are not clearly connected in a way that demonstrates causality or development between the speakers' past interactions and the current conversation. The references to suggestions or Speaker A's upbringing do not directly contribute to generating a meaningful next response for Speaker B. Therefore, the MEMORY provides limited helpful information for the dialogue context."
