Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is getting a portrait done of themselves and their brother, interested in couponing deals. Speaker B is a painter and is working on a portrait for Speaker A. Speaker B has 5 dogs of different breeds and has rats as pets but didn't include them in the portrait. Speaker B is busy with school and taking care of their five dogs, so working at a doggy daycare would be too much. Speaker B is working on other portraits and taking care of a sick dog. Speaker B is an artist, did a painting for Elton John and has student debt from art school. Speaker A is getting their portrait painted by Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It indicates the relationship between Speaker A and Speaker B through the painting and portrait situation, which directly relates to the context where Speaker A mentions the portrait. The MEMORY also provides additional information about Speaker B's personal and professional life, such as having five dogs, school commitments, and involvement with other paintings. While some details, like the sick dog and painting for Elton John, add depth to Speaker B's character, not all are directly tied to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT in a meaningful way. However, overall, the MEMORY is well-connected and aids in understanding the interaction between the two speakers, thus providing relevant content for generating the next response."
