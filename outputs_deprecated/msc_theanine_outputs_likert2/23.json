Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is a high school student planning to go to college, achieving straight A's. Speaker B is considering giving up their night job to focus on lab work and school.\nSpeaker B is also a high school student preparing for college, working at a diner at night. Speaker A and Speaker B are involved in different fields of work, cooking and lab research.\nSpeaker B is also a high school student preparing for college, working at a diner at night. Speaker A plans to try the famous hamburgers made by Speaker B at the diner. Speaker A had cheesy ham and potato soup for dinner. Speaker B has invented a chilli dog casserole that Speaker A wants to try.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant background information about Speaker A and Speaker B, which could be useful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the information is somewhat repetitive (e.g., mentioning multiple times that Speaker B is a high school student preparing for college), and the connection between Speaker A and B's activities (cooking and lab research) isn't clearly linked to the ongoing dialogue about cloning a cow and eating a hamburger from a cloned cow. While the MEMORY provides context on their work and interests, it doesn't necessarily connect smoothly with the current conversation topic about lab work and cloned cows. Therefore, it somewhat benefits generating a response but isn't optimally clear or directly relevant."
