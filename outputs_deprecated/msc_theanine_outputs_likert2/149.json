Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?\nSpeaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping?\nSpeaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp?\nSpeaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer?\nSpeaker A: I've only camped in a tent so far, but would like to try out a camper trailer. What do use for camping?\nSpeaker B: We usually do tents but we have camped in yurts too. Did you go to the zoo last weekend?\nSpeaker A: I see. Yes, I did make it to the zoo.  Have you gone to your local zoo?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities. This is why Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys. In contrast, Speaker B's daughter likes monkeys and is starting to assert her independence. On a similar note, Speaker B is interested in finding family discounts for the zoo as well as pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be helpful for continuing the conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker A's interest in zoos and their love for visiting them, which is directly related to the last part of the dialogue where Speaker A confirms their recent zoo visit. It also notes Speaker B's interest in family discounts for the zoo and their daughter's enjoyment of monkeys, which could be relevant if the conversation continues about zoo visits or animals. However, the MEMORY includes some details that are not directly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A growing up in big cities and Speaker B's daughter asserting her independence, which do not seem immediately useful for generating the next response. The MEMORY would benefit from more direct integration and relevancy to the ongoing conversation about camping and zoos."
