    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume.\nSpeaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment. \nSpeaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A finds fulfillment in volunteer work, currently working on painting projects and interested in trying lotus origami. They offered to teach Speaker B origami soon. \nSpeaker A enjoys art, specifically painting, while Speaker B enjoys traveling and visiting gardens. Speaker B keeps a turquoise lotus origami on their desk from Japan. \nSpeaker B enjoys running and singing, as well as traveling and visiting gardens. Speaker A wants to try making lotus origami next after successfully making a Lotus flower.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I think it's a mix of both! Some origami designs are simpler than they appear, while others can be quite challenging. But with practice and patience, anyone can learn to create beautiful origami pieces.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides several connected pieces of information that could help Speaker A generate a suitable next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Speaker A's interest in and offer to teach origami directly correlate with the conversation about origami in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Memory that Speaker B keeps a turquoise lotus origami on their desk from Japan not only provides a personal detail but also a connection to their interests in origami and gardens. Speaker A wanting to try lotus origami adds to their credibility and passion for origami. These details provide Speaker A with additional context about Speaker B's interests and their shared interest in origami, which can facilitate a more engaging and personalized conversation. However, there are some unrelated details such as Speaker B's enjoyment of running and singing, which do not directly contribute to the next response about origami. Hence, while there are many helpful connections, the overall coherence and focus on the relevant parts result in a score slightly below perfect."
