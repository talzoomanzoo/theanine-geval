Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden?\nSpeaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B mentioned playing tennis and going to church on Sunday, while Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country yet. This has led Speaker A to consider visiting their cousin in Sweden and start saving money for the trip. As a result, Speaker A and Speaker B are now planning to travel to Sweden together.\n\n2. During a conversation about the differences between Sweden and the US, including coffee breaks, Speaker A realized they have a cousin in Sweden but have not visited the country. This realization sparked the idea of visiting their cousin and the need to save money for the trip. Additionally, Speaker B, who has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses, suggested checking out the volcanoes in Sweden for a unique experience.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great plan for next summer! I'll make sure to check out the beach spots you mentioned when I visit Sweden.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information that could be helpful for Speaker A to generate a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The first memory snippet provides background about Speaker A's cousin living in Sweden, which is related to the current conversation about planning a trip to Sweden. The idea of saving money for the trip is also connected, as it aligns with the planning aspect being discussed. However, the details about playing tennis and church seem irrelevant and do not contribute towards planning the Sweden trip, nor do they enhance the current dialogue context. The second memory snippet talks about a different conversation regarding the differences between Sweden and the US and brings up volcanoes, which do not clearly connect with the current dialogue about castles and travel plans. The connections and causality of events in the MEMORY could be presented more naturally to enhance its helpfulness."
