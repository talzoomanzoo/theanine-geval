Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\nSpeaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call!\nSpeaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip? \nSpeaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has a lot of kids, all grown up now and with kids of their own. This causes Speaker A to have kids and be busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. Speaker B, in turn, wants to spend time with their grandkids at the park, enjoying the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n\nSpeaker A, a librarian who loves kids, mentions having 3 children. This leads to Speaker A being busy with work and unable to spend as much time with their kids as they would like. Speaker B, who has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park, took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's enjoyment of spending time with their grandkids and their interest in making the fishing trip an annual tradition. This indicates the speaker's fondness for family time and outdoor activities, which relates to the topic of discussion in the dialogue. However, the MEMORY contains some repetitive and somewhat irrelevant information, like the repeated mention of Speaker A's busy work life due to having children. Additionally, the connection between the events is not very clear, and the causal relationship between memories and the dialogue context is not fully demonstrated. Therefore, while the MEMORY provides some context, it lacks coherence and a strong causal or relevant link to the dialogue."
