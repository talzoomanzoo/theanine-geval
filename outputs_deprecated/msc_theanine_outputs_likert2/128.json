Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well?\nSpeaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes?\nSpeaker A: I want to take some martial art classes at school next year. What do you sggest I try?\nSpeaker B: I mean I always recommend Karate since that's what I study! I can bring you by the dojo sometime if you want to see what it is like. \nSpeaker A: OMG!! That would be so awesome, Yes please.  When is a good time for you?\nSpeaker B: Awesome! Tomorrow afternoon anytime between 3-6 would work for me!\nSpeaker A: Perfect. I will meet you at the Dojo at 3pm. I really appriciate it, and I will buy you lunch after too. \nSpeaker B: That's great! I can bring some guest passes to the pool I lifeguard at as well!

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker B that can help inform Speaker A's response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly the fact that Speaker B is currently a lifeguard, which is mentioned in their offer to bring guest passes to the pool. However, the details about Speaker B's background in football and their contemplation of a career change to IT, while providing some context for Speaker B's character, do not directly aid in the immediate dialogue about martial arts and planning a meet-up. The connections between the elements in the MEMORY are somewhat natural, but the focus on Speaker B's professional transition is not particularly connected to the interaction at hand."
