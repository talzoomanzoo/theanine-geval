Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A met their neighbor John who loves soccer, which led Speaker B to study sports medicine and play soccer, with a goal to join their college team in the future. As a result, Speaker B's professors have been supportive in writing letters for an internship application. This situation prompted Speaker A to offer advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, emphasizing the medical field.\nSpeaker B, a college student who used to play soccer with other students, transitioned into looking for internships in the sports medicine field and sought letters of recommendation from professors. Consequently, Speaker B's professors have been supportive in writing letters for an internship application. In reaction, Speaker B is struggling with finding internships and feeling disadvantaged compared to others with connections.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's amazing, thank you so much for the connection! I'll definitely reach out to them to explore internship opportunities in the sports medicine field.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant background information about Speaker B's interest in sports medicine and their efforts to secure an internship, which aligns with the topic discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It clearly establishes a causality relationship: Speaker B's meeting with Speaker A's neighbor led to their decision to pursue sports medicine and look for internships. The MEMORY also mentions Speaker B's struggles with finding internships and their professors' support, which could be useful for Speaker B's response in the dialogue.\n\nHowever, some repetition and slightly disjointed presentation of events (such as repeating the supportive professors' information) makes the MEMORY somewhat less coherent. Additionally, while it provides context, the connection between meeting John and Speaker B's current situation is rather indirect. A more streamlined and focused MEMORY could have scored higher as it would directly enhance Speaker B's response generation."
