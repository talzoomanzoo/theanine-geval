Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it?\nSpeaker B: Yes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see. \nSpeaker A: I definitely will, this sounds like such an amazing trip. How long has it been since you've been there yourself?\nSpeaker B: I was in Greece last two years ago.   I am excited to go again soon!    At somepoint I would like to take a cruise around the islands there.  It seems like a neat way to see all the Islands in an easy way.   Have you ever taken a cruise?\nSpeaker A: Only once before when I was very young, so I don't remember much. It sounds like such a relaxing way to enjoy the day, though. Maybe we can plan a cruise together sometime.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A's favorite cities from the trip were Rome, Berlin, Madrid, and Helsinki. This sounds like such an amazing trip. \nSpeaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five. Speaker B and their kids are excited about their upcoming trip to Greece.\nSpeaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian. Speaker B is planning to leave for a trip later in the summer, likely a month before school starts.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That would be fantastic! I'll have to look into planning a cruise around the Greek islands for our next adventure.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains information that partially aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly regarding Speaker B's excitement and plans to visit Greece, which connects with the conversation about the Acropolis and Greece in general. However, there are discrepancies that lower the score: \n\n1. Speaker B mentions having visited Greece two years ago in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, whereas the MEMORY states it will be their first time visiting Greece and that they plan to leave later in the summer, introducing inconsistencies.\n2. There is no mention of Speaker A's favorite cities in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making this detail unrelated and therefore not helpful for continuing the current conversation.\n3. The MEMORY includes Speaker B's travel planning details (traveling with family, timeframe), which could be relevant, but the inconsistency with the context (claiming it would be their first trip) detracts from its usefulness.\n\nThe MEMORY does offer some relevant travel-related excitement and enthusiasm on Speaker B's part, but it lacks coherence and consistency with the ongoing DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Improvements could be made by aligning MEMORY details with the CONTEXT and focusing more on shared past travel experiences and plans."
