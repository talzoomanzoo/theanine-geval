Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you.\nSpeaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is an inventor working on a teleportation machine that is currently small and requires substantial energy sources. Speaker B is also interested in space exploration and plant science, expressing concerns about the fuels used for space travel. Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden. \nSpeaker B is a fan of Beethoven and hopes to meet him by time traveling. Speaker B is working on a teleportation machine that is currently small and requires substantial energy sources. Speaker A is interested in nuclear energy and space exploration, mentioning fusion experiments. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing.\nSpeaker B is an inventor working on a teleportation machine that is focused on developing renewable energy sources for their inventions. Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "I'll definitely consider planting plum and pear trees in my garden. Thanks for the suggestion!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that could aid Speaker A in generating a response. It highlights Speaker B's interest and knowledge in plants and gardening, which directly relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A seeks garden suggestions. Additionally, both speakers' mutual interest in space exploration could contribute to further conversation. However, the MEMORY is somewhat fragmented as it includes unrelated details about Speaker B's teleportation machine, weight gain, and Beethoven fan interest, which do not directly contribute to the discussion at hand. More focused and connected sentences relevant to gardening and plant science would increase the helpfulness."
