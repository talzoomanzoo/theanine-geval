Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well?\nSpeaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes?\nSpeaker A: I want to take some martial art classes at school next year. What do you sggest I try?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is studying marketing and enjoys it. Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work. Speaker B signed up for classes at the local college and has a background in football and karate. Speaker B attends football games at their old high school and finds that their football background helps in karate footwork.\n\nSpeaker B practices karate and works as a lifeguard but is looking for a different career. Speaker B is considering a career change to the IT sector due to their computer skills and the growing demand for employees in that sector. Speaker B tans easily and takes precautions against sunburn and skin cancer due to the nature of their job. Speaker B tans easily and only uses sunscreen on specific areas like the tops of their feet and face.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "If you enjoy karate, you might like trying out judo or taekwondo!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It emphasizes that Speaker B practices karate and holds a green belt, which suggests their proficiency and experience level in karate. This is pertinent because Speaker A is seeking suggestions on martial arts classes, so this experience might contribute to a credible recommendation. However, much of the MEMORY talks about Speaker B's background in football, career considerations, and sun protection habits, which do not directly relate to martial arts and might not be directly helpful in generating a response to Speaker A's query about martial arts classes. The presence of unrelated information makes the MEMORY less helpful overall. The connections between sentences in terms of relevancy and usefulness for the given context could be clearer, leading to a mid-range score."
