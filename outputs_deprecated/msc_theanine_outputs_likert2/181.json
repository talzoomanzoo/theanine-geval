Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know. \nSpeaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like.\nSpeaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too.\nSpeaker B: Nice! Is anyone coming with you?\nSpeaker A: Just my doggy Drunky.  You never know,  I might meet a nice lady out there. \nSpeaker B: Totally.  There will be a bunch of women there and it'll be easy to strike up conversations.  Just be confident and I'm sure you could walk away with a bunch of numbers.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is a mechanic who enjoys working on cars, while Speaker A frequents live band venues, plays music at home, and both enjoy bluegrass music.\n2. Speaker A owns a Subaru Legacy and mentions having a baby on the way, causing Speaker B to not go out drinking much due to their wife's pregnancy. As a result, Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day, which is a topic where Speaker A is not sure if they will ever settle down with a partner and have kids.\n3. Speaker A does not live in Mexico but likes Mexican food and women, which changed to enjoying going to bars and loving the ladies. Speaker B, on the other hand, dislikes public transportation and enjoys going to festivals but misses doing so.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks, I'll keep that in mind. Who knows, maybe I'll find someone who loves bluegrass music as much as I do.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides information relevant to Speaker A and Speaker B's interests and personal lives, which can be helpful for generating contextually aware responses. It mentions Speaker B's passion for cars and the couple's interest in bluegrass music, which ties into the current bluegrass show context. It also incorporates details about Speaker A's social life and viewpoint on settling down, which provides context on his relationship status and potential interest in meeting someone at the festival.\n\nHowever, the structure of the MEMORY is slightly fragmented, with some details being more relevant than others, such as preferences in transportation and personal life choices that are less directly impactful for the immediate context of planning for the festival. While the MEMORY overall connects past interests and situations, it lacks more direct causality and immediate applicability to the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This fragmentation and lack of clear event progression reduce its overall helpfulness."
