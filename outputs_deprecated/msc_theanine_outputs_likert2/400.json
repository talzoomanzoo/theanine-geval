Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. \nSpeaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me.\nSpeaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house. \nSpeaker B: Understandable. Have you ever tried contacting animal control? That's how I got Bandicoot. I was working that day and animal control came by explaining about needing fosters for raccoons. I thought it was weird, so I did it and began to work at the small raccoon cafe that is part of the zoo. I love it. \nSpeaker A: That is a good idea.  Maybe they could help move them to a safer area.  I have a lot of traffic around and they could get hit if they are coming to my place all the time.  Have you been able to teach your raccoon any tricks?\nSpeaker B: The only trick I was able to teach him, that I deeply regret, was how locks worked. I thought it was cool at first, you know, to see a raccoon unlock a door. And now, I regret it so much. I've had to change the layout of my apartment and put deadbolts on my doors so that Bandicoot can't get out. And, he is sneaky about it. One time, he unlocked the pantry and was eating some cookies! It's like having a toddler that never grows up.\nSpeaker A: That is bad I guess.  Do you keep all of your chemicals, poisons, and medications up and locked?  I would hate to think what might happen if Bandicoot got into any of that.  Hey, when you drive do you lock him up in a cage or let him wander around in the car?  That could be dangerous for you driving and he freaks out.\nSpeaker B: All the chemicals and poisons are in a gated lock in the basement. The lock requires a specific key, which I have hidden in my drawers. For medication, I have a small box that I also keep locked up, but it's a combination lock, so Bandicoot isn't able to get into it. For driving, I bought a harness that keeps him strapped in the back seat, he can move a bit, but mostly sturdy. I put blankets down and his favorite toys so that he stays calm. Sometimes, I'll pass small snacks to keep him occupied. I also take the side streets to work so that it's not too much for him. What about you? When you foster dogs, do you put them in a cage when you drive?\nSpeaker A: I do keep the dogs secured. You never knwo how they are going to react.  Most of them I only have for a few days, so I really do not get a chance to see how they will act in all situations.  \nSpeaker B: Oh, does that make you want to adopt a dog? I know you said it makes you sad to see them come and go, so why not adopt one?\nSpeaker A: It easer to foster them right now.  If I go out of town for a few days and I had my own dog, I might not be able to take it with me.  So the foster stuff is best.  I can take in a dog for only the time I can spend a lot of time with it.  I think this is best for the dog.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B's work as a zoo keeper and enjoyment of it sparked Speaker A's interest in animals, particularly raccoons and bearded dragons. This led Speaker B to take care of a raccoon for over a month and develop an interest in training it. In response, Speaker A is currently dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to purchase aluminum sheeting to cover up holes. \n\nSpeaker B, who works as a zoo keeper and finds joy in it, believes raccoons are intelligent and amusing. Consequently, Speaker B wishes raccoons can make good pets if properly cared for. Additionally, Speaker B ensures their garbage has a lock to prevent animals from accessing it, especially during windy weather. \n\nSpeaker A fosters dogs until they find a forever home, while Speaker B works at a Raccoon Cafe, taking care of Bandicoot, a raccoon. Both Speaker A and Speaker B share a passion for helping animals find suitable environments.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That makes sense. Fostering dogs seems like a rewarding way to help them without the long-term commitment. It's great that you can provide them with a loving environment until they find their forever homes.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker B's work with raccoons and their interest in animals, which can be useful in understanding Speaker B's perspective in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, there are inaccuracies and missing details, such as Speaker B's work at the Raccoon Cafe, which is not explicitly stated in the context but rather implied. Additionally, the MEMORY mentions Speaker A's interest in bearded dragons, which is not present in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Also, the MEMORY does not effectively capture the precautions Speaker B takes with Bandicoot, such as securing chemicals and medications or the specifics of transporting Bandicoot in the car. Overall, while there are helpful elements, the MEMORY lacks precision and completeness in capturing pertinent details from the actual conversation."
