Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go?\nSpeaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \nSpeaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on?\nSpeaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study?\nSpeaker B: Ah, English should be easier than History. Sure, I can help you. What do you need to do exactly? Write an essay?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, we have to write an essay and we have a spelling component towards the end of the exam, I sure could use a little help!\nSpeaker B: No problem! I like correcting and editing essays. Although, it seems like your English is pretty good. I doubt you even need much help.\nSpeaker A: Excellent, thank you for taking the time to help me out a little. I would like to get an A!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B studying sports medicine in college has been getting all A's in the class, causing Speaker A to struggle to maintain good grades and excel only in gym. Speaker A, hopeful for a soccer scholarship, wishes to improve their grades. Speaker B feels pressured to maintain straight A's in sports medicine to avoid embarrassing their mother, who runs the school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information that could be relevant to the context, such as Speaker B studying sports medicine and their academic performance. However, it is not well connected to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on exams, history, and English. The fact that Speaker B is in college and pursuing sports medicine doesn't directly influence the specific interaction between A and B regarding English exam help. Furthermore, the sentences in MEMORY are not naturally connected, and there's no clear causality or reasonings to connect them to the ongoing dialogue, making it a bit challenging for the language model to generate a next response that is in line with the conversation's current trajectory."
