Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?\nSpeaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities. Speaker B is interested in finding family discounts for the zoo. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n2. Speaker B is away from their child and glad that the pets are with them. Speaker B expresses concern about leaving a kitten alone during their family camping adventures. Speaker A assures Speaker B that kittens are not as much work as expected and can be left for short periods, even mentioning kitty daycares.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains certain elements that can be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Memory 2, in particular, connects to Speaker B's camping experience, as it mentions Speaker B's concern about leaving a kitten alone during camping trips. This is somewhat relevant to Speaker B's current mention of camping in the dialogue. However, the connection between the MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT isn't fully explicit or directly actionable for generating Speaker A's next response. Memory 1, on the other hand, has some relevance around Speaker B being a parent and associated interests like the zoo, but it doesn't directly relate to the specific topic of camping being discussed. Furthermore, while the two parts of MEMORY provide information about the past interactions of the speakers, they are slightly disjointed in relation to each other and mainly focus on zoo-related activities rather than camping directly. Thus, while the MEMORY contains useful tidbits, it lacks full coherence and direct relevance to be more helpful."
