Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her?\nSpeaker B: Hi there, hope you are wlll and managing to save up for your Italy trip?  Thank for asking about the Greek mythology study, we are doing very well. It helps because i am so passionate about it and hope to get to the Greek islands soon\nSpeaker A: Yes I have been saving up for another trip to Italy! I can't wait. It's planned for next Spring. Do you have any plans to go back to Italy in the future?\nSpeaker B: I would love to get back to Italy but need to save up and the hopeful priority is to Greece this year.  You have friends in Europe are you in contact to see what plans you can make?\nSpeaker A: Yes I've been talking to them quite a bit so they know what's going on. I'll be staying with some of them while I'm over there. I have never been to Greece....I'd like to go though. Maybe I'll add it to my itinerary! Maybe we could plan to be in Greece at the same time?!\nSpeaker B: That would be so good.  There is so much history and the roman statues i take my daughter to see in the museums and through our local resources is fab.  She is building up the passion which is lovely to see.  Have you still got your hair blue or has it grown out now?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is planning for a spring break trip to Italy and recently bought a dress for Easter. Speaker B does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology. Speaker A is fascinated by the architecture of Italy and enjoys studying history, especially through reading and watching documentaries. Speaker B has been to Italy in the past and enjoyed the food there. Speaker A is planning to travel to Italy alone for Spring Break and has friends from Europe meeting up with them. Speaker B suggests California as a destination for Speaker A's trip. Speaker B has tried surfing before but is not very good at it. Speaker B appreciates the idea of superhuman powers and is interested in historical events that involve such figures.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "My hair is back to its natural color now, but I'm considering trying a new color before my trip to Italy. I'll keep you posted on my decision!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for generating a proper response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It notes that Speaker A is planning for a spring break trip to Italy, which aligns with the context where Speaker A mentions saving up for another trip to Italy planned for next Spring. It also mentions Speaker B's interest in visiting Greece for history and Greek mythology, which is relevant because Speaker B discusses a hopeful priority trip to Greece. However, the MEMORY contains some unrelated or less relevant details, such as Speaker B suggesting California, trying surfing, and Speaker A's interest in Italian architecture and history, which do not contribute to the ongoing dialogue about potential travel and shared interests. Additionally, the MEMORY does not highlight the connection through Speaker A's friends in Europe, which could be more immediately beneficial for generating the next response in the context of planning overlapping trips to Greece. Overall, while some helpful insights are provided, there are also notable gaps and less relevant details."
