Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue.\nSpeaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad.\nSpeaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs!\nSpeaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours?\nSpeaker A: Ikea! Their furniture is not to expensive and they have all kinds of furniture that'll go with whatever scheme you're going for. What kind of patio furniture were you looking for? Like a barbeque, chairs, hammock? \nSpeaker B: I guess I was going to get like an umbrella table and some chairs to go with it or maybe even a screened in gazebo with a fire pit in the middle.\nSpeaker A: That's a great idea! Sounds like a very nice place for a barbeque. What were you planning on grilling for the barbeque? \nSpeaker B: I'll get the steaks to grill if you will bring the corn. And I have a request for you to play on the guitar, I know you are into country so if you could maybe play a song or two by Miranda Lambert, that would be awesome.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B are both discussing furniture and home decor choices, planning to meet up to exchange ideas. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company. \nSpeaker B is renovating their house to meet their living standards with their pets, planning to grill steaks this weekend using an old charcoal grill. Speaker A is excited about spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights. \nSpeaker A likely lives on a corn farm.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Sure, I can definitely play some Miranda Lambert songs for you at the barbecue. I'll make sure to grab some corn too!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information about the discussion concerning furniture and plans for a barbecue, which aligns well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memory highlights Speaker B's interest in furniture, renovating their house, and grilling steaks, which corresponds to dialogues about color schemes and types of patio furniture. However, the mention of Speaker A inviting Speaker B over to enjoy new furniture and suggest a night with music, which could relate to playing guitar, is relevant but not explicitly mentioned in the context.\n\nThe MEMORY also makes assumptions about Speaker A living on a corn farm and spending quiet evenings grilling, which are not explicitly corroborated within the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. These points might not aid in a language model generating a response unless further context establishes their relevance. Also, details about Speaker B's standards and pets are not discussed in the context, making them less helpful.\n\nOverall, MEMORY connects to certain aspects of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but contains some information that doesn't directly relate to the given conversation. Therefore, while informative, it doesn't fully cater to the immediate needs outlined in the dialogue exchange."
