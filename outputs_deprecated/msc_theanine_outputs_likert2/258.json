Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\nSpeaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\nSpeaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\nSpeaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.\nSpeaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe?\nSpeaker B: There is some weird chemical mix that I really do not mess with.  It is easy to clean up.  I try to stay away from this part of the movies.  I know what it should look like and that we want to keep everyone safe when using the fake blood.\nSpeaker A: Chemicals!  Do the actors hate working with it then?  I can imagine they are a pretty high maintenance bunch.  Do they worry about the blood messing with their looks?\nSpeaker B: Our actors are pretty amateur.  No big name ones so they are really good to work with.  Hey, how about you?  How is your interview practice going?  I am pretty sure you be excellent during it!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys painting and taking naps, while Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\n\nSpeaker B's father's involvement in producing horror movies influenced Speaker B's favorite genre, which aligns with Speaker A's passion for producing horror movies and belief that everyone loves them. Speaker A also likes mid-century design and is a fan of horror movies.\n\nSpeaker B's father's involvement in producing horror movies influenced Speaker B's favorite genre. This led to a change in Speaker A's preference, as they now prefer classic horror movies like Halloween or Friday the 13th over modern ones.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks for asking! My interview practice is going well. I'm feeling confident about it. And it's great to hear that your actors are easy to work with. It must make the production process smoother.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights Speaker B's connection to horror movies through their father and notes their preference for classic horror movies. However, the memory contains some inaccuracies such as confusing Speaker A and Speaker B's roles and interests, e.g., Speaker A is mistakenly described as being passionate about producing horror movies instead of Speaker B. Additionally, some details, such as Speaker A's interest in mid-century design, are not relevant to the current dialogue. While the MEMORY gives some context about Speaker B's background and interests, which could aid in crafting a response, it isn't entirely coherent or well-connected to the ongoing conversation, resulting in a moderate score."
