Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships!\nSpeaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!   I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field?\nSpeaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, as the only child of Speaker B's mother who runs a local high school, is studying sports medicine and plays soccer, aiming to join their college team in the future. Speaker A, offering advice and encouragement to Speaker B on the internship hunt, brings up the medical field. Speaker A used to surf when they were younger, contrasting with Speaker B's current lack of skill in surfing. However, Speaker A is trying to get back into surfing. Speaker B, a college student who plays soccer with peers, is now seeking internships in sports medicine and has approached professors for recommendation letters. Additionally, Speaker B is training for soccer and aspires to make the school team as a walk-on player.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",
