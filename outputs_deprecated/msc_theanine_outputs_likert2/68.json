Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play? \nSpeaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music.\nSpeaker A: ah right, who's your favourite rock band?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys rock music and wants to see Sublime live one day. They are part of a band that tours different countries for their music. Speaker A is good at writing and plays music, possibly a musician. Speaker A is in a band where they play the drums and write music, with 4 members including the singer who is their best friend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains information that is somewhat helpful in generating a next response. It provides context about Speaker A's interest in rock music and their involvement in a band as a drummer and a writer. This could be relevant for building on the conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about favorite rock bands. However, the connection and causality between the details in the MEMORY and the immediate dialogue context are not very strong. The MEMORY contains information that might not directly relate to the current conversation flow, and there is no explicit connection to Speaker B's interest or background. To improve the score, the MEMORY could include more information that directly ties together Speaker A's and B's interests or the current topics being discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
