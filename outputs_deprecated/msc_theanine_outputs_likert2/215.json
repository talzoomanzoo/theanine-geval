Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships!\nSpeaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!   I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field?\nSpeaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate?\nSpeaker B: I have another year- so this year is really important I get internships and start making connections in the field.   I love going to the beach too.  What happened with your knees that now cause you so much pain?\nSpeaker A: I think age has really been my knees downfall. I also used to hike a lot and I put a lot of pressure on my legs. That is great that you only have a year. Maybe when you graduate you can come hang out on the beach with me. I can't surf but I would love to watch you.\nSpeaker B: That would be fun!  I like collecting shells too so we could do that as well.  I have a small collection of ones I have from around the world.  The farthest away was from Greece.  Have you traveled a lot?\nSpeaker A: I have. I love Europe. I have been to many countries there but I have not gone to Greece yet. I would love to. The scenery and architecture is amazing. Have you gotten to visit other European countries?\nSpeaker B: I have.   I have also been to France and Ireland.  Where have you been in Europe?\nSpeaker A: Oh gosh. I have been to France, England, Ireland, Switzerland, Austria, Poland, Germany, Leichenstein, Spain, and much of Mexico, and Bermuda. I just love to travel but I have not been able to recently and with my knees I cannot sit in coach anymore and first class is so expensive. Do you plan on settling any place in particular once you graduate? \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A mentions their neighbor John who loves soccer, which causes Speaker B to be studying sports medicine and playing soccer, looking to join their college team in the future. This leads Speaker B's professors to be supportive in writing letters for an internship application, prompting Speaker A to offer advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field.\nSpeaker B's mother running a local high school, with Speaker B being her only child, leads to Speaker B being interested in sports medicine and enjoying surfing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I haven't decided yet where I want to settle, but I'm definitely keeping my options open. Traveling sounds amazing, especially to all those European countries you've been to.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided has a limited connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While it touches on Speaker B's interest in sports medicine and the topic of internships, as discussed in the context, the MEMORY introduces new and unrelated elements such as Speaker A's neighbor John and Speaker B's college team, which were not mentioned in the context. Furthermore, the details about Speaker B's mother running a local high school and Speaker B enjoying surfing weren't present or directly relevant to the ongoing conversation. The MEMORY lacks a coherent structure or clear causality that directly ties to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making it only minimally helpful for Speaker B, represented by a language model, to generate a proper next response."
