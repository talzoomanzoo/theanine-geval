Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company? Do you build computers or work on programming?\nSpeaker B: I do like my job. My job is to troubleshoot issues between the hardware and software, so I get to work with both.\nSpeaker A: That sounds interesting. That's great that you love your job, not many people do.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys reading books about ice cream, Disney World, and computers, and is open to meeting for lunch and is flexible with food choices. \nSpeaker B works for a computer company and is unable to change careers until their child graduates, but is interested in taking them to Disney World and is willing to help set up a meeting between Speaker A and their mother. \nSpeaker A works for a small local business with a demanding schedule, does not have children, spends time working and reading, and prefers late morning for a meeting.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some useful background information, such as Speaker B working for a computer company, which is relevant to the current dialogue context discussing their job. However, the memory mostly focuses on other unrelated topics like Disney World, meetings, schedules, and personal details about Speaker A's reading preferences and work schedule. These details are not directly relevant to the immediate context or expected upcoming responses. Additionally, the connections between these past interactions and the current conversation are weak, making it difficult to see how they would be helpful in generating a meaningful next response. The MEMORY would be more helpful if it contained more directly relevant details or elaborated connections related to discussions of their job or work experiences."
