Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing?\nSpeaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals and discovered their love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets. They also think pit bulls are lovely and have one that is kind and sweet. Additionally, Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions. Speaker B's prices for a portrait start at $5000 to pay for college tuition, as they are an artist who did a painting for Elton John and has student debt from art school. Currently, Speaker B is working on other portraits and taking care of a sick dog.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a unique and fun portrait idea! As for the cat, I'm still exploring different shelters and breeders to find the perfect match.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be helpful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker B's interest in painting portraits, which aligns well with the ongoing conversation about portraits of pets. Additionally, the memory highlights Speaker B's artistic background and financial motivations, which might offer context for why they engage in such projects. There's also mention of pets like pit bulls and Persian cats, creating a possible connection to the current conversation about animals. However, the MEMORY contains some details that are not directly relevant to the current dialogue, such as working with Elton John and student debt. While these are interesting facts, they don't directly contribute to the response generation between Speaker A and Speaker B in their current exchange. The information is somewhat scattered, with only partial cohesion between MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
