Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\nSpeaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is playing soccer and volunteering at their mom's school in the after-school program. Speaker A is studying computer science and expressing a desire to develop apps for differently abled youth. Speaker A is also interested in teaching computer science, particularly in the field of robotics. \n\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college while studying computer science. Speaker B has transitioned to casually playing Overwatch and enjoying 1st person shooter games for their quick pick-up-and-play nature. Speaker B recommends trying the game Elder Scrolls, aware that Speaker A plays World of Warcraft.\n\nSpeaker B was majoring in linguistics but has now changed course to consider pursuing a masters degree after completing their bachelors. This change is influenced by their hope of turning linguistics into a practical job, potentially becoming a college professor in the field. Speaker B, while studying linguistics, expresses feeling limited in job opportunities.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I think I'd like to teach linguistics, it's a subject I'm passionate about and I believe it's important to pass that knowledge on to others.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant background information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker B's consideration of becoming a college professor and their concern about limited job opportunities, which ties into the career-related discussion in the dialogue. Additionally, Speaker B's involvement in volunteering at their mom's school could be pertinent to their interest in teaching. However, much of the information in MEMORY regarding hobbies like playing games, and Speaker A's work and interests outside of the immediate dialogue topic (such as developing apps), is not directly beneficial for Speaker B's next response generation in this context. The connections between the MEMORY and the context are present but not very strong or directly impactful, warranting a mid-range score."
