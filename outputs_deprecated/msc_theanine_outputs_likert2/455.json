Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue.\nSpeaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad.\nSpeaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is in the process of renovating their house to meet their living standards with their pets. Speaker A suggests ways to incorporate the purple sofas into the existing light green paint in the room, leading Speaker B to regret their green and purple color scheme and be willing to give away their purple furniture. \nSpeaker B is looking for furniture shop to buy furniture, has two dogs, and works near a mall. Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing furniture and home decor choices, which causes them to plan to meet up to discuss the furniture exchange. Speaker A, who has devices to keep bugs away, offers to share the product names with Speaker B, who wants to bring bug spray for their barbecue meeting. \nSpeaker A and Speaker B both enjoy barbecuing and have a love for pets. They acknowledge their lack of expertise in interior decorating, which leads them to plan to meet up to discuss the furniture exchange. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "I had considered a gray and navy color scheme as well. Your lamp sounds like it will be really helpful to keep the bugs away during our barbecue.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful context for the dialogue. It mentions Speaker B's ongoing house renovation and their preferences in color schemes, which is relevant to the current conversation where Speaker A suggests a color scheme. The MEMORY also includes past interactions about home decor and furniture, which ties into Speaker B's request for advice on their living room. Additionally, it highlights the element of bug control, consistent with Speaker A's offer to bring a lamp that keeps bugs away. While MEMORY briefly mentions a furniture exchange, which isn't directly related to this context, it maintains a logical and connected sequence of events linking past and current interactions, enhancing the overall helpfulness for generating Speaker B's response."
