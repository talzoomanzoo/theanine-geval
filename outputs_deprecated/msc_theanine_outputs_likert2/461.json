Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue.\nSpeaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad.\nSpeaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs!\nSpeaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours?\nSpeaker A: Ikea! Their furniture is not to expensive and they have all kinds of furniture that'll go with whatever scheme you're going for. What kind of patio furniture were you looking for? Like a barbeque, chairs, hammock? \nSpeaker B: I guess I was going to get like an umbrella table and some chairs to go with it or maybe even a screened in gazebo with a fire pit in the middle.\nSpeaker A: That's a great idea! Sounds like a very nice place for a barbeque. What were you planning on grilling for the barbeque? \nSpeaker B: I'll get the steaks to grill if you will bring the corn. And I have a request for you to play on the guitar, I know you are into country so if you could maybe play a song or two by Miranda Lambert, that would be awesome.\nSpeaker A: Of course! I love Miranda Lambert, any specific song requests? \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both acknowledge their lack of expertise in interior decorating. They plan to meet up to discuss the furniture exchange and enjoy a night with music, food, and company. Speaker A invites Speaker B over for this purpose. \n\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both enjoy barbecuing and have a love for pets. Speaker B plans to grill steaks this weekend using an old charcoal grill. Speaker A is looking forward to spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights.\n\nSpeaker B plans to grill steaks this weekend using an old charcoal grill. They suggest making enough barbeque for leftovers on nights when grilling is not possible, due to time or energy constraints.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "How about \"The House That Built Me\" and \"White Liar\"? I think those would be great choices for the barbecue.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could help in generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. There are mentions of Speaker B grilling steaks and Speaker A looking forward to outdoor activities, which aligns with the context's theme of planning a barbecue. However, the MEMORY could be more connected and detailed, particularly in acknowledging specific requests or suggestions from the dialogue. For instance, Speaker B's request for Speaker A to play Miranda Lambert is missing from the MEMORY, and the discussion about interior decorating lacks depth and continuity in terms of the specific suggestions made. Overall, while the MEMORY aligns in terms of broad activities and interests discussed, it lacks specific details and connections that would make it more helpful."
