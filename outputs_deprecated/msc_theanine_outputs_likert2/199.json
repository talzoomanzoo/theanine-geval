Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college?\nSpeaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position. \nSpeaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it?\nSpeaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket but is now a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments. \nSpeaker A joked about treating Speaker B to lunch, indicating Speaker B is currently low on cash, and Speaker B is considering asking for a raise at work as a clerk for a law firm and enjoys the work but wishes it paid better.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context that could be helpful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is not entirely relevant or naturally connected. The fact that Speaker A is now a member of a soccer team could provide a common interest for discussing soccer further, but it doesn't directly relate to the conversation about Speaker B's past experience as a goalkeeper. The portion about Speaker A joking about lunch and Speaker B considering asking for a raise does not seem relevant to the topic of missing playing soccer or reliving those times. Overall, while there are elements in the memory that could contribute to understanding the relationship and interests of the speakers, the connections are not clear or directly helpful for continuing the specific conversation about soccer."
