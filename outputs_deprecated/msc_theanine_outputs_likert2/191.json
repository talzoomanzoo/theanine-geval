Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make?\nSpeaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it.\nSpeaker A: I would love to, I enjoy cooking so maybe you can teach me to make it, too?\nSpeaker B: Yeah definitely! I know you like hot foods, so if you learn and can make them fresh it will taste amazing. Have you tried any new foods lately?\nSpeaker A: Not any new foods, but I did try a new food truck near me that was delicious! It was street tacos and you could pick from barbacoa, chicken, and steak for the protein. Do you like Mexican food? \nSpeaker B: Oh god I do love Mexican food. That was be so hard to pick because they're all so good! Did they have al pastor by any chance? I loved marinated pork tacos.\nSpeaker A: unfortunately no, but I can ask them if they plan to get it in the future. I had one of each and they were all good in their own way. Have you ever had Birra tacos? I'd love to try those next.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe. This reminds them of the good old days.\n- Speaker A wakes up early in the morning to catch waves, while Speaker B likes to eat huge steaks after snowboarding. They both have different routines but share a love for specific activities.\n- Speaker B's grandmother was the matriarch of the family, known for cooking large meals for family gatherings. This is why Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones.\n- Speaker A is part of a music band and plays the drums, and also loves making food for others.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I haven't tried Birra tacos before, but they sound intriguing! I'll have to look for a recipe and make them for you next time you come over. What other types of cuisines do you enjoy?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information about Speaker B's enjoyment of cooking and the sentimental value attached to their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe, which ties in with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B discusses cooking and shares the recipe with Speaker A. The memory about Speaker B's passion for cooking for loved ones and the connection to family gatherings also enrich the context. Additionally, it frames Speaker B's overall enjoyment of food (notably steaks after snowboarding) and complements Speaker A's inquiry about different kinds of foods and cooking activities. The MEMORY entries are largely interconnected and provide helpful background information for generating a coherent continuation of the conversation. However, there is less direct relevance in the mention of Speaker A being part of a music band, indicating slight room for higher relevancy and connection among all memory points."
