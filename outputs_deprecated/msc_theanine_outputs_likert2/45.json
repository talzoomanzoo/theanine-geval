Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs. Speaker A hosts football parties and loves football season. Speaker A feeds the horses grass roughage with some grains, particularly oats. Speaker A mainly knows about horses and doesn't know much about psychology. Speaker A is involved in horse breeding and taking care of horses. Speaker A works at a stable and enjoys being around horses. Speaker B is concerned about the cost of owning horses, including medical fees and expenses like horse shoes. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant context that could aid the language model in generating a response. For instance, it highlights Speaker B's profession as a therapist, which is directly relevant to the dialogue context. Additionally, it establishes both speakers' interests in football, which could serve as a potential topic for further dialogue. The MEMORY also notes Speaker A's passion for horses and Speaker B's interest in the psychological and financial aspects of owning horses. However, the connection between different memory points is not fully fleshed out, and some details (e.g., Speaker A's knowledge about horses vs. psychology) may not be directly relevant to continuing the dialogue in a meaningful way. Overall, the MEMORY provides background information but could benefit from clearer linkage to the dialogue context to ascertain causality or relevance more effectively."
