Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet? \nSpeaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name?\nSpeaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \nSpeaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, who lives in the city they grew up in and loves animals, has a cat that recently had a kitten, which caused them to have two sick kitties and recently receive a rescue. This situation led Speaker A, who has a parrot named Tasha, to be interested in adopting a rescue kitten. \nSpeaker B, who lives in the city they grew up in and loves animals, has a cat that recently had a kitten, which caused them to have two sick kitties and recently receive a rescue. This led Speaker B to have 3 cats, two of which are sick, and look for someone to adopt one of them, which made Speaker A interested in training tips for the kittens and open to adopting one despite having a parrot. \nSpeaker A, who has a pet parrot named Tasha and has red hair that makes them stand out, has a pet named Tasha who speaks Mandarin, and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I've been doing some research on introducing cats to birds. It seems like a slow and careful introduction process is key to help them get along.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It explains that Speaker B lives in the city they grew up in, loves animals, has a cat that recently had kittens, and is involved in rescuing animals. It also indicates that the situation of having several cats led to Speaker A's interest in adopting a rescue kitten, despite having a parrot. This reflects the conversation about kittens and adopting animals in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\nHowever, there is a lot of repetition in the MEMORY, and some details, like the parrot speaking Mandarin and Speaker A's red hair, are not directly relevant to the immediate conversation about adopting kittens. The MEMORY could be more concise and focused to enhance coherence and relevance. This results in a score of 3, as the MEMORY provides some helpful information but could be structured more naturally and succinctly to support the specific context."
