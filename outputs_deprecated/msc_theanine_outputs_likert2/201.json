Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college?\nSpeaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position. \nSpeaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it?\nSpeaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \nSpeaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living.\nSpeaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plays soccer as a striker, has a match next week, and is a member of a soccer team that competes in tournaments.\n2. Speaker A has been performing well in soccer recently, scoring goals.\n3. Speaker A joked about treating Speaker B to lunch, suggesting that Speaker B is currently low on cash, and Speaker B offered to connect Speaker A with someone working in HR.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker A and their involvement in soccer, which could be useful for generating a response. Specifically, the fact that Speaker A plays soccer as a striker, has a match next week, and is a member of a soccer team are relevant details that align with the context of the conversation centered around soccer. This connection can help in forming a natural continuation of the dialogue.\n\nHowever, the detail about Speaker A joking about treating Speaker B to lunch and Speaker B's current financial situation seems less directly relevant to the immediate context, which is primarily about soccer-related experiences and aspirations. The memory lacks clear connections or causality with the dialogue, particularly the last part regarding HR, which does not tie into the current flow of the conversation. Therefore, while parts of the memory are helpful, the absence of cohesion across all details affects the overall score."
