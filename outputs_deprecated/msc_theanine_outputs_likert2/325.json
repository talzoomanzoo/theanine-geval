Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume.\nSpeaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has visited 20 countries and enjoys the color turquoise. Speaker A and Speaker B both like the color turquoise. Speaker B keeps a turquoise lotus origami on their desk from Japan. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully. \n\nSpeaker A finds meaning and fulfillment in doing volunteer work. As a result, Speaker A is working on painting projects in their craft room. Speaker A volunteers at a hospital and enjoys making origami crafts, specifically a 3D modular swan with glue. This changed when Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as it links Speaker A's interest in origami, which is relevant to the contest they won, with their past activity of making origami crafts. It highlights Speaker A's penchant for the craft and how they developed this interest by learning it independently, as well as their enjoyment in creating a specific origami piece. The MEMORY also establishes common interests between both speakers, such as the color turquoise and origami, which could be useful for the interaction. However, it contains some extraneous details about Speaker B, like visiting 20 countries, that are not directly relevant to generating the next response in this context."
