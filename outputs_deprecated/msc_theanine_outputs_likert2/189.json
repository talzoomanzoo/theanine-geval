Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make?\nSpeaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it.\nSpeaker A: I would love to, I enjoy cooking so maybe you can teach me to make it, too?\nSpeaker B: Yeah definitely! I know you like hot foods, so if you learn and can make them fresh it will taste amazing. Have you tried any new foods lately?\nSpeaker A: Not any new foods, but I did try a new food truck near me that was delicious! It was street tacos and you could pick from barbacoa, chicken, and steak for the protein. Do you like Mexican food? \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe. This always reminds Speaker B of the good old days. Speaker B's grandmother was the matriarch of the family, known for cooking large meals for family gatherings.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I love Mexican food, especially street tacos! Barbacoa, chicken, and steak all sound delicious. I'm glad you enjoyed the food truck, we should definitely try it out together sometime.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that is helpful for generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It connects with prior mentions of Speaker B's fondness for garlic chicken and their enjoyment of cooking, which aligns with the dialogue about cooking spicy foods like garlic chicken. The memory's mention of the grandmother and her recipe adds depth to Speaker B's interest in cooking, linking their culinary passion to family tradition, which naturally develops the conversation. However, while this information is helpful, it doesn't directly relate to the last part of the context about trying new foods and Mexican food, so there's a small gap in addressing that transition in the conversation."
