Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys watching movies with her kids, and they all really enjoyed watching 'Miracle'.\n2. Speaker B's kids enjoy watching Disney movies, which Speaker B also finds good, and Speaker B recommends Speaker A to watch 'Miracle'.\n3. Speaker B's kids enjoyed watching 'Luca' and said it was good, despite Speaker B preferring romance and horror movies, which their kids do not enjoy.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: MEMORY provides relevant information that can assist Speaker B in generating a next response to Speaker A. The memory entries establish that Speaker B enjoys watching movies with her kids and specifically recommended 'Miracle' to Speaker A. This suggests that discussing the movie and its enjoyment could be a natural continuation of the conversation. Additionally, MEMORY mentions Speaker B's kids' preference for Disney movies, and their enjoyment of 'Luca', providing Speaker B with further potential topics to expand upon while keeping the dialogue naturally connected. Although the mention of Speaker B's preference for romance and horror is not directly relevant to 'Miracle', it adds depth to Speaker B's character. Overall, MEMORY supports a natural flow of conversation following the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
