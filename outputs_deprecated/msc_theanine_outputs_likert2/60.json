Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\nSpeaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk?\nSpeaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous.\nSpeaker B: That sounds amazing! Did you bring a pet? I love doing the harder trails with my dog. Sometimes, it's very peaceful to get away from everything.\nSpeaker A: No, I don't have any pets; my apartment seems too small for a dog and I would worry about them being lonely all day when I'm at work. I was thinking about getting a pair of cats, but I haven't committed yet. How nice fo ryou to have company when you're walking though! What kind of dog do you have?\nSpeaker B: Cats can be nice! I used to have cats, but am allergic to them and had to give them to my friend. I have an Australian Kelpie who is a rescue. She is very energetic and smart!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B loves nature and works with animals, while Speaker A enjoyed reading 'Redwall' growing up and keeps an eye out for similar books. Speaker A is a fan of the Game of Thrones series and enjoys audiobooks. Speaker B is an artist who walks through nature for work and is interested in Pilates but dislikes the idea of having to follow specific steps in exercise. Speaker A is a city dweller who walks to work instead of driving and emphasizes the importance of proper form in exercise to prevent injuries.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some general background information about Speaker A and Speaker B, but it lacks specific details that would be directly helpful in generating a next response based on the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The mention of Speaker B's love of nature and Speaker A's residence in a city shows some connection to their current discussion about nature walks and pets, but the rest of the MEMORY (interests in books, audiobooks, and exercise) does not directly relate to the topics being discussed. Additionally, the MEMORY does not include the relationship between the past interactions in DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's history with cats and currently owning a dog. The information provided is relevant in parts but not comprehensive or directly connected to the ongoing conversation."
