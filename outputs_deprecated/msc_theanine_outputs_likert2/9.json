    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\nSpeaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing? \nSpeaker B: He's doing well! He just finished theatre camp and he's fighting with my sister because he wants to dye his hair green hahaha.\nSpeaker A: Young people today really have different values than our generation had. Acting sounds like it would be personally rewarding. I also like the arts. I play guitar and piano. You mentioned that you have a poll. That sounds refreshing in the hot weather.\nSpeaker B: Yes it's great, but it hasn't stopped raining here! How's the weather where you are?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation.\nSpeaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one.\nSpeaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break, and wants to go on a trip but has not started packing yet.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "The weather here has been pretty mild, not too hot or cold. Hopefully, it clears up for your trip to Costa Rica!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some background information about Speaker A's and Speaker B's personalities, such as them having a sense of humor. However, this information is not directly relevant or helpful for generating Speaker A's next response in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY also contrasts their spring break plans, but this is not particularly relevant to the ongoing discussion, which has moved on to topics such as travel to Costa Rica, books, history, family, and weather. The memory does not provide naturally connected, causally relevant information needed for the dialogue's development. As such, it doesn't greatly aid in informing or guiding the next response."
