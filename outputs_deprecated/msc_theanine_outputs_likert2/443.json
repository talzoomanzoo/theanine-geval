Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast.\nSpeaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is planning to take summer courses soon and is very active, enjoying martial arts. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts. \nSpeaker A is enrolled in a class on the history of martial arts and is majoring in athletic training. Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class and enjoys it. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts. \nSpeaker A is planning to take summer courses soon and is very active, enjoying martial arts. Speaker B is busy debugging software and is a runner. Speaker A and Speaker B have not booked any holidays recently.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains several relevant pieces of information that are somewhat helpful in generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that both Speaker A and Speaker B have an interest in martial arts, which could be a relevant topic based on the context. The MEMORY also indicates that Speaker A is active and enjoys martial arts, aligning with the context where Speaker A mentions having a blast at martial arts class. Furthermore, Speaker B signed up for an online class about martial arts history, which could be used as a conversational bridge between the speakers.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY repeats some information and could be more concise and connected. Multiple mentions of Speaker A enjoying martial arts and Speaker B's involvement in software work as well as the history of martial arts class create redundancies rather than providing a clear, causally linked background. The inclusion of details about summer courses and holiday bookings, while potentially interesting, seem disconnected from the immediate DIALOGUE CONTEXT and don't enhance the immediate conversational needs.\n\nFor a higher score, the MEMORY would benefit from a more integrated and relevant set of details that smoothly support the conversation and demonstrate clear logical connections relevant to the present DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
