Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well?\nSpeaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes?\nSpeaker A: I want to take some martial art classes at school next year. What do you sggest I try?\nSpeaker B: I mean I always recommend Karate since that's what I study! I can bring you by the dojo sometime if you want to see what it is like. \nSpeaker A: OMG!! That would be so awesome, Yes please.  When is a good time for you?\nSpeaker B: Awesome! Tomorrow afternoon anytime between 3-6 would work for me!\nSpeaker A: Perfect. I will meet you at the Dojo at 3pm. I really appriciate it, and I will buy you lunch after too. \nSpeaker B: That's great! I can bring some guest passes to the pool I lifeguard at as well!

I have been craving cold cuts! \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys studying marketing and foreign languages, hoping to create ads for movies in the future. Speaker B, who practices Karate and holds a green belt, is considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work. Additionally, Speaker B attends football games at their old high school and finds that their football background helps in karate footwork.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information about Speaker B's background in karate which aligns with the topic of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where they discuss meeting at the dojo. However, the MEMORY is overall not very helpful in providing natural connections or causality for the context. Most details in MEMORY, such as Speaker B's career considerations, interest in IT, and football background, do not directly inform the next steps in the conversation about martial arts. Additionally, Speaker A's interests in marketing and languages, while interesting, do not add immediate value to Speaker A's decision about taking martial arts classes or the immediate conversation at hand. The information about sun safety, while tangentially tied to the mention of sunscreen in the dialogue, does not offer much toward developing the next response. This does not provide a strong direct causality or relevant linkage to the current progression of the discussion."
