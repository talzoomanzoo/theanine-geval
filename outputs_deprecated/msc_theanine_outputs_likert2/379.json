Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A's favorite tattoo is the one dedicated to their late father, saying \"for you I shall live\". Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\n2. Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father. Speaker A works at a coffee shop and is saving up for their next tattoo.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that could help a language model in generating a proper response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Both sentences in the MEMORY highlight Speaker A's interest and intentions related to tattoos, particularly those dedicated to family members like their father. This supports the context of Speaker A wanting to get a tattoo for their mom. The memory also mentions Speaker A's fondness for tattoos and provides additional context about their financial planning and current job, which can contribute to understanding their situation and priorities. The connection between these points is well established, making the memory both cohesive and useful. However, the connection to the specific tattoo for Speaker A's mom is implied rather than explicit, which is why the score isn't a perfect 5."
