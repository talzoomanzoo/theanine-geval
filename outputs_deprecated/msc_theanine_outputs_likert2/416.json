Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin!\nSpeaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name? \nSpeaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls! \nSpeaker B: I see what you meant. Plus the color is beautiful orange. I want to see them together, even I am not a cat person they must be cute together at that time. Once the kitten grows up, situation gonna change to me. How are they, they are doing well?\nSpeaker A: Marmalade is orange too but this is better because the baby is sassy and climbs up my leg to sit on my shoulder. I don't understand how you are not a cat person when you have such a large heart for stray kittens.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten, which they enjoy taking on trips. Speaker A has a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Marmalade. \nSpeaker B loves dogs and is excited for the trip, looking forward to trying the best iced tea.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I guess I just never had a strong connection to cats growing up, but I can definitely appreciate their playful nature. Pumpkin sounds like quite the character already!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for generating a next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It correctly captures Speaker A's situation of having a cat, Ginger, and recently a kitten. The consideration of naming the new kitten Marmalade is also mentioned, which ties into the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where they're discussing a name change to Pumpkin. However, the MEMORY doesn't fully capture the reasoning behind the name choice or the relationship dynamics between the kitten and Ginger, which are essential in the dialogue. Furthermore, Speaker B's excitement about a trip and love for dogs don't directly relate to the ongoing conversation about the cats, hence providing limited immediate relevance. The structure could improve by focusing more on the aspects directly discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
