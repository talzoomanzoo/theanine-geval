Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\nSpeaker B: I will be there for 2 weeks. I am really looking forward to both relaxing and learning about the culture! How are you? Have you read any good books lately?\nSpeaker A: I enjoy historical fiction as well as nonfiction. I really enjoy learning about early American history. I enjoyed reading \"The Gettysburg Campaign\"'\nSpeaker B: That sounds interesting. What is it about? I'm not really into history.\nSpeaker A: It was about strategy and it was so different than modern military strategy. Back then opposing sides actually had manners and would sometimes mutually agree to stop fighting so that they could take a break. How is your nephew doing? \nSpeaker B: He's doing well! He just finished theatre camp and he's fighting with my sister because he wants to dye his hair green hahaha.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation. \nSpeaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one. \nSpeaker B dyed their hair with henna and enjoys experimenting with different hair colors. \nSpeaker A is getting their hair dyed turquoise by their youngest grandchild, who wants to pursue hairdressing as a profession.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided includes several pieces of information that are minimally connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The detail about Speaker B dyeing their hair with henna and experimenting with hair colors is somewhat relevant, considering Speaker B's nephew wants to dye his hair green. However, other details, such as Speaker A's spring break activities or their grandchild dyeing their hair, are not directly related to the current conversation about travel, books, or the nephew's interests. The MEMORY lacks cohesion and natural connections or causalities between past interactions that would enhance and support a relevant continuation of the dialogue. Therefore, while some sentences might offer slight context, overall, it seems somewhat disjointed with respect to the active conversation."
