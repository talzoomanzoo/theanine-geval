Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on!\nSpeaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar.\nSpeaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general?\nSpeaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners. This causes Speaker A to have a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes. \nSpeaker A learned how to make jello from their grandma, turning it into a family tradition. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "It's surprising how much sugar goes into desserts, but maybe you can try experimenting with alternative sweeteners or healthier dessert options to satisfy your sweet tooth.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful information for Speaker Aâ€™s response generation. It establishes that Speaker A also has a family tradition around making jello taught by their grandmother, which aligns well with the conversation about family traditions, cooking, and learning recipes. It also offers a potential suggestion for Speaker A to bring up in the dialogue, regarding Speaker B considering their grandmother as a surrogate for learning jello recipes. The memory content is relevant and naturally connected to the dialogue context, reinforcing the shared experience Speaker A has with jello and family traditions. However, the memory includes the notion of Speaker A's grandmother as a \"surrogate grandmother\" for Speaker B, which is not the most direct connection but still adds a meaningful layer to the conversation."
