Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive.\nSpeaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price?\nSpeaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music\nSpeaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it.\nSpeaker A: I'll keep trying! Have you had any luck lately?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A values the peaceful life of working on the farm and suggests that Speaker B and their family could stay over at the farm after the concert. They also discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\nSpeaker A and Speaker B have a friendly interaction and part ways on a positive note, both having bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\nSpeaker B believes that luxurious items distract from the value of their family, while Speaker A bought 50 lotto tickets with different numbers to increase their chances of winning.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful context related to the conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically regarding the lottery and Speaker A's interest in winning it to potentially mitigate the cost of their new iPhone. The MEMORY indicates that both speakers have an interest in playing the lotto and have even bought tickets for a jackpot, which relates to Speaker B's mention of winning the lotto in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY also contains information that is not directly relevant to the current conversation, such as the value Speaker B places on family over luxury items and the idea of staying at a farm after a concert, which don't connect with the ongoing exchange about the iPhone and lottery. Additionally, the connections and developments between past interactions are not entirely clear, which somewhat limits its helpfulness in generating a relevant and coherent response in the context provided."
