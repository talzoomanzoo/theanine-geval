Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well?\nSpeaker B: I haven't!

    "raw_prediction": "Tomorrow afternoon between 3-6 sounds perfect for me as well! Can't wait to check out the dojo with you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be helpful in generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It tells us that Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, which aligns with the conversation about practicing Karate and suggesting it to Speaker A. This detail provides a basis for why Speaker B is recommending Karate and offering to show Speaker A the dojo. However, the MEMORY includes some repetitive sentences and additional information that isn't directly pertinent to the current dialogue (e.g., considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work, signing up for classes at the local college, and attending football games). This makes it less streamlined and leads to a lack of cohesive development in terms of the past interactions between the speakers that would directly boost the continuation of the dialogue. A more concise and focused MEMORY could score higher by directly contributing to the immediate situation in the dialogue."
