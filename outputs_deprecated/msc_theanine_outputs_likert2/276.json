Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing?

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant details that can be useful to generate a next response in the context of this dialogue. It accurately reflects Speaker B's interest in Greece and Greek mythology, which is relevant to the discussion in the context. It also mentions Speaker A's trip to Italy, aligning with the current conversation. However, the part about Speaker B trying surfing lacks relevance to the ongoing dialogue about travel plans and interests in Greek mythology. The MEMORY could benefit from a more focused connection to Greece or Italy travel plans to be more helpful."
