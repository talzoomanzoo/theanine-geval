Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \nSpeaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with?\nSpeaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point.\nSpeaker A: Yes, it contains eggs.  I think you would do well with the fried rice. It's best to cook the rice the day before.  \nSpeaker B: I didn't know that. Why cook the rice beforehand? Is it better to age rice or something?\nSpeaker A: The rice needs to be cool before adding to the pan.  Are you able to take a passenger along in you truck?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys cooking and baking, possibly considering turning it into a business. This interest in cooking leads Speaker A to primarily cook Indian food and bake a lot of rice dishes. Speaker A also bakes muffins and bread but is conscious of their impact on their weight. Additionally, Speaker A recommends the pressure cooker for its efficiency and ease of use, suggesting it to Speaker B who is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY contains some useful information that could assist a language model in generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, it mentions Speaker A's interest in cooking and their preference for Indian food, which aligns with the context of sharing recipes and the use of a pressure cooker. Additionally, Speaker A's recommendation of the pressure cooker for its efficiency relates to the dialogue about using it for cooking rice. However, some details, such as Speaker A's consideration of turning cooking into a business or the impact of baking on their weight, are not directly relevant or necessary for continuing the conversation in this specific context. Overall, while there are helpful elements, the MEMORY does not entirely offer naturally connected or deeply relevant information for the ongoing discussion, hence the score of 3."
