Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B discussed the differences between Sweden and the US, including coffee breaks, which led Speaker B to recommend checking out the volcanoes in Sweden for a unique experience. Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country, so Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin and needs to save money for the trip by taking a second part-time job. As a result, Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a significant amount of context that is relevant and helpful for generating a next response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It details previous discussions between Speaker A and Speaker B about Sweden and the US, which is pertinent given Speaker A's trip planning. Additionally, it includes Speaker A's considerations, like visiting a cousin and taking a second part-time job to save money for the trip, which are relevant to the progress of planning the trip. Lastly, the MEMORY mentions that both speakers are planning to travel to Sweden together, which suggests that Speaker B has a vested interest in the trip as well. The MEMORY's sentences are well-connected and provide a clear picture of the current situation and past interactions, although a bit more detail on the actual progress might make it even more helpful."
