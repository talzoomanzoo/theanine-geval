Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go?\nSpeaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is on their way to college and studying sports medicine, which is causing them to get all A's in the sports medicine class. This pressure stems from the need to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n   \n2. Speaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject, leading them to feel pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n   \n3. Speaker B is on their way to college and studying sports medicine, while Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring. Both are dealing with different academic pressures and feelings of being overwhelmed.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information that can be useful for Speaker A in generating a response. It gives context to Speaker B's academic situation, particularly their pressure to maintain high grades in sports medicine due to familial expectations. This information is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where studies and exam performance are being discussed, and it naturally connects to Speaker B's feelings about upcoming exams. There is a clear connection between Speaker B's focus on maintaining grades and the stress associated with taking exams. However, while it provides insight into Speaker B's context, MEMORY does not expand much on Speaker Aâ€™s situation beyond mentioning a struggle with history. This limits the completeness of information about both speakers, and thus, while well-connected, isn't entirely comprehensive."
