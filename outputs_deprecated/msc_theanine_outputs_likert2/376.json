Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens?\nSpeaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month\nSpeaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.  Where are you going on vacation?\nSpeaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there!\nSpeaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo?\nSpeaker B: Their zoo is pretty good! It's always crowded, of course, but they have pandas so I'm happy. I would say it's bigger than the DC zoo, but I like that the DC zoo has fewer people.\nSpeaker A: That sounds awesome.  I haven't been to the zoo in so long.  I wish I could go.\nSpeaker B: You should go with your sister! she can bring her dog. They probably have all kinds of exotic birds...\nSpeaker A: That's a great idea!  I'm not sure how good her dog would do around other animals though.  She always barks like crazy whenever she sees any kind of animal.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A's sister recently got married, which was exciting for them. This event causes Speaker A to enjoy seeing pandas and penguins at the zoo and goes with their sister. Speaker A's sister is a dog person with a yellow lab, even though it changed to Speaker A has a sister who owns a corgi.\n\nSpeaker A and Speaker B discuss hobbies and interests, with Speaker A enjoying gardening and reading, and Speaker B enjoying visiting the zoo. Speaker B's girlfriend enjoys pandas and penguins at the zoo, and they go to the zoo every few weeks, which makes Speaker B want his girlfriend to have a cockatoo that makes a lot of noise. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend because his girlfriend has a cockatoo named John.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Maybe your sister's dog just needs a little socialization. It could be a fun adventure for all of you!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that could potentially aid in generating a response in the context of the dialogue, such as Speaker B's interest in adopting a kitten and their enjoyment of visiting the zoo. However, the MEMORY is also filled with details that are not directly helpful or are irrelevant to the current dialogue context. There are inconsistencies and unnatural connections, such as the change from a yellow lab to a corgi owned by Speaker A's sister, and the mention of Speaker A enjoying seeing pandas and penguins, which isn't connected properly to the dialogue context. Furthermore, Speaker B's girlfriend is mentioned with interests in pandas and penguins, which might confuse the dialogue flow considering Speaker B is the person visiting the zoo in the context. Additionally, the reference to the cockatoo named John does not clearly relate to the current topic of discussion. Overall, while there are snippets of relevant information, the MEMORY could be better structured and connected to provide more coherent and helpful context for the dialogue."
