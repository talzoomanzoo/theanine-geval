Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it?\nSpeaker B: Yes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see. \nSpeaker A: I definitely will, this sounds like such an amazing trip. How long has it been since you've been there yourself?\nSpeaker B: I was in Greece last two years ago.   I am excited to go again soon!    At somepoint I would like to take a cruise around the islands there.  It seems like a neat way to see all the Islands in an easy way.   Have you ever taken a cruise?\nSpeaker A: Only once before when I was very young, so I don't remember much. It sounds like such a relaxing way to enjoy the day, though. Maybe we can plan a cruise together sometime.\nSpeaker B: That would be fun!  I go to Europe a lot so maybe a cruise in the Caribbean would be nice.  I would like to see Saint Lucia and Saint Thomas. \nSpeaker A: Oh, Europe? I'm already sold on the idea, sounds like a blast! I've never had a negative experience in Europe. Should we visit some of the capital cities?\nSpeaker B: I would like to go to Paris.  Since I live in Amsterdam I could take the train down.  I have seen much and Italy and Greece but would love to go to Paris.  Have you been there before? \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B are both librarians who enjoy reading. Speaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian. Speaker B wants to plan a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five. Speaker B and their kids are excited about their upcoming trip to Greece.\n\nSpeaker B has three kids. Speaker A wants to have kids and is familiar with Greek mythology. Speaker A wants to travel around Europe and visit the capital cities of each country. Speaker A booked a plane ticket to Rome on a whim and is leaving in two weeks.\n\nSpeaker A and Speaker B are both librarians who enjoy reading.

    "raw_prediction": "Paris sounds amazing! I haven't been there yet, but it's definitely on my list of must-visit places. The train ride from Amsterdam to Paris sounds like a lovely way to travel between cities.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information about Speaker A and Speaker B, such as their shared profession as librarians and their interest in reading. It also mentions Speaker B's excitement about visiting Greece and their family's upcoming trip, which relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about visiting the Acropolis. However, there are several issues that reduce the helpfulness of the MEMORY. \n\nFirstly, some details are repeated unnecessarily, such as Speaker B's excitement about Greece and Athena being a perfect goddess for a librarian. Additionally, the MEMORY contains information that is not directly relevant to the current dialogue, such as Speaker B's excitement about visiting Greece for the first time, which is inaccurate given Speaker B mentioned being in Greece two years ago in the dialog. Moreover, it doesn't establish a clear connection or causality between the events described within the MEMORY and the current conversation. \n\nThis lack of coherence and the presence of irrelevant or inconsistent details make it harder for Speaker A, representing the language model, to generate an appropriate next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
