Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens?\nSpeaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month\nSpeaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.  Where are you going on vacation?\nSpeaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there!\nSpeaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo?\nSpeaker B: Their zoo is pretty good! It's always crowded, of course, but they have pandas so I'm happy. I would say it's bigger than the DC zoo, but I like that the DC zoo has fewer people.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B discuss hobbies and interests, with Speaker A enjoying gardening and reading, and Speaker B enjoying visiting the zoo. Speaker B's girlfriend enjoys pandas and penguins at the zoo, and they go to the zoo every few weeks. Speaker A has been to the zoo before and enjoys seeing exotic birds. Speaker A prefers cockatoos over kittens as pets. \nSpeaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo. Speaker B's girlfriend enjoys pandas and penguins at the zoo, and they go to the zoo every few weeks. Speaker B's girlfriend has a cockatoo that makes a lot of noise. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "San Diego sounds like a fun trip! Make sure to say hi to the pandas for me when you visit the zoo.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information that helps in understanding the interests and inclinations of both speakers. Speaker B's enjoyment of zoo visits and their girlfriend's interest in pandas and penguins align well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about planning a trip to the San Diego Zoo, which has pandas. Additionally, Speaker B considering adopting a kitten from a friend is directly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT's initial question about adopting kittens. The repeated mention of Speaker A preferring cockatoos over kittens and both their past zoo experiences, while slightly redundant, also gives context to any further discussions about pets and zoo visits. The information is mostly naturally connected and aids in generating a relevant and proper next response, hence it scores a 4."
