Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\nSpeaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car?\nSpeaker B: Yes, there are several. Hope we could meet and You possibly teach me about computer programming.\nSpeaker A: That would be great too. I like to program in several different languages. Do you have a preference?\nSpeaker B: No, I'm just getting started so I don't have a preference. Maybe you could show me what you prefer and we could start there.\nSpeaker A: Sure. I usually like to start with html and css so we can start there. We'll order some pizzaburgers to help us out. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming, despite Speaker B not knowing how to swim but enjoying watching swimming movies. Speaker B also enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming. Additionally, Speaker A has planned a cruise to the Caribbeans, and both Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together while enjoying cruising in their car listening to punk music.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Sounds like a plan! Pizza and programming, can't go wrong with that.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information about the interactions between Speaker A and Speaker B. It highlights Speaker A's willingness to teach Speaker B swimming and programming. It also mentions Speaker B's interest in punk music, swimming, and programming, which partially aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY contains some inaccuracies and lacks important details. For example, it inaccurately states that Speaker B enjoys watching swimming movies, which is not mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY mentions cruising in their car and listening to punk music, which could be misleading or confusing given the context. The connection and causality between events are not as clearly demonstrated, making it less helpful for generating a proper next response. Improvements could involve focusing more on the accurate details and relevance of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
