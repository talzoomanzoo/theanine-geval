Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons\nSpeaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is saving up for their next tattoo while working at a coffee shop that their mom owned, planning to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan already tattooed on their chest. Speaker A's favorite tattoo is dedicated to their late father, and they want to add another one with their father's portrait and a slogan.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY is quite helpful as it provides relevant background information about Speaker A's intentions and connections with tattoos. It tells us that Speaker A works at a coffee shop owned by their mom, which adds context to the familial significance behind their tattoos. The MEMORY also highlights Speaker A's ongoing plan to get a portrait of their father, aligning with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A mentions getting a new tattoo for their mom. It provides insight into Speaker A's sentimental relationships and personal motivations related to tattoos, aiding Speaker B in crafting a meaningful response. However, it lacks detailed connections or developments between the past interactions of the speakers, which would make it more robust."
