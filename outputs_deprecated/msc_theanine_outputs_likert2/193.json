Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make?\nSpeaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it.\nSpeaker A: I would love to, I enjoy cooking so maybe you can teach me to make it, too?\nSpeaker B: Yeah definitely! I know you like hot foods, so if you learn and can make them fresh it will taste amazing. Have you tried any new foods lately?\nSpeaker A: Not any new foods, but I did try a new food truck near me that was delicious! It was street tacos and you could pick from barbacoa, chicken, and steak for the protein. Do you like Mexican food? \nSpeaker B: Oh god I do love Mexican food. That was be so hard to pick because they're all so good! Did they have al pastor by any chance? I loved marinated pork tacos.\nSpeaker A: unfortunately no, but I can ask them if they plan to get it in the future. I had one of each and they were all good in their own way. Have you ever had Birra tacos? I'd love to try those next.\nSpeaker B: I've never had birra tacos, what are those? They sound intriguing.\nSpeaker A: If I understand it correctly, the tortilla is dipped in the liquid from the braised meat, and then fried on a flat top. Then filled with the meat that was braised and other toppings that you like. I'll let you know if I find a place that serves these tacos in our area!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys outdoor activities like surfing and grew up in a beach town, but now prefers cooking new dishes and trying out recipes occasionally.\nSpeaker A is a member of a music band where they play the drums and also loves preparing food for others.\nSpeaker B wakes up early in the morning to catch waves, while Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and cherishes their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe. Speaker B's grandmother was the heart of the family, known for preparing large meals during family gatherings.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "That sounds delicious! I'll have to keep an eye out for a place that serves Birra tacos too. It's always exciting to try new foods, especially when they come with such unique preparation methods.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information that can assist Speaker B, a language model, in generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker B enjoys cooking and specifically cherishes their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe, which aligns with the conversation about cooking and trying new foods. Furthermore, Speaker B's appreciation for cooking connects positively with the context where they discuss spicy foods and learning new recipes together with Speaker A.\n\nHowever, MEMORY also contains information about activities like surfing and music band involvement, which are not directly relevant to the current conversation. Additionally, while the MEMORY includes some contextual information about Speaker A's preference for cooking, it doesn't fully connect or develop from the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT in a natural way as it distracts from the main food-related topic.\n\nOverall, while relevant information is present, not all sentences in MEMORY smoothly connect back to the current dialogue, hence the score of 3."
