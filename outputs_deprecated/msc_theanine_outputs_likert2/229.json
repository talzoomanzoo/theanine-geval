Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "raw_prediction": "I've been considering naming the rescue kittens based on their personalities. Any suggestions?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful information that can guide Speaker B in generating a response to Speaker A's question about kitten names. The MEMORY mentions that Speaker A has suggested the name Zhao for one of the kittens, and this directly connects to the context about naming the kittens. Additionally, it highlights Speaker B's interest in Mandarin names, which creates a thematic link to Speaker A's pet Tasha, who speaks Mandarin. This connection could naturally lead to further discussion about adopting kittens and what to name them. \n\nThe information about Speaker B's familiarity with the city, their love for animals, and their challenge with sick kittens offers a backdrop that may influence their decision on naming or adopting out kittens, though this is less directly related to the specific query about naming. Overall, the MEMORY provides a coherent thread of interactions and themes that relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, though some parts could be less directly relevant."
