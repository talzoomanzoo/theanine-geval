Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B found their calling to become a therapist due to their passion for helping people and their enjoyment of listening and talking to others. This led them to start their own practice six years ago. Despite the challenges, Speaker B finds the impact they can make on people's lives to be incredibly rewarding.\n\nSpeaker B, as a therapist, offered to discuss the absence of Speaker A's mother and suggested lying down on their couch. They expressed interest in owning a horse in the future, contemplating the psychological aspects of it in relation to Freudian theories. Additionally, Speaker B, being a therapist and a football fan supporting the Chiefs, acknowledged the professional boundaries by not engaging in relationships with clients.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I've never done therapy, but I can see how it could be beneficial. What made you decide to start your own practice?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does contain some useful information about Speaker B that relates to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's passion for helping people and their enjoyment of listening and talking to others, which led them to become a therapist. This directly answers Speaker A's question about why Speaker B chose the profession. The MEMORY also touches on the challenges and rewards of being a therapist, which aligns with Speaker B's sentiments in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY includes extraneous information about Speaker B's personal interests and past interactions that are not relevant to the specific conversation at hand, such as their interest in owning a horse and their support for the Chiefs. Additionally, there is some disjointedness in transitioning between topics like Freudian theories and professional boundaries, which could hinder the natural flow and coherence when generating the next response."
