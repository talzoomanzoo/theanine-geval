Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for.\nSpeaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for?\nSpeaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\nSpeaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise? \nSpeaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows.\nSpeaker A: That sounds wonderful! You'd get to just be out in nature all day. Sounds like a great job, especially if you're a bit introverted like me. That's why hiking is my favorite -- a good solitary activity. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is looking for a job and new camping gear, specifically a hammock. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail. Speaker A decides not to bring the hammock due to extra weight in their bag. Speaker A has a portable hammock for the hike and asks if Speaker B will bring theirs. \nSpeaker A enjoys camping and hiking, mentioning setting up a hammock at their campsite. Speaker A plans to leave a hammock by the river for anyone to use at a hidden spot off the main hiking trail.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, being a park guide sounds like a great fit for you. You could combine your love for nature with your job. It's a dream job for many outdoor enthusiasts.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context that might be relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it aligns with Speaker A's interest in the grocery store (which they applied to, as mentioned in both the CONTEXT and MEMORY) and their love for hiking and camping, which is relevant to Speaker A expressing they enjoy hiking in the conversation. However, MEMORY has details about camping gear and hammocks that were not mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT making those parts less helpful. The lack of clear connection or causality between these mentions in MEMORY and the current conversation results in a moderately helpful score. The parts about Speaker A's job application and enjoyment of outdoor activities are useful but not entirely structured to demonstrate clear development or causality related to the existing dialogue."
