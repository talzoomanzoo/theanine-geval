Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A's cousin recently moved to Sweden, which has sparked Speaker A's interest in visiting the country. This desire to visit Sweden is leading Speaker A to consider saving money by taking on a second part-time job. Additionally, Speaker B, who is from Sweden, suggested checking out the volcanoes in the country for a unique experience.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A's cousin living in Sweden and Speaker A's interest in visiting. Additionally, it mentions that Speaker A is considering taking a second part-time job to save money for the trip, which could be useful for Speaker B to know when discussing the trip's progress and planning details. However, the mention of checking out volcanoes is misleading, as there are no volcanoes in Sweden, which could confuse Speaker B in generating a proper response. While the MEMORY contains relevant information, it could be more helpful with more accurate details."
