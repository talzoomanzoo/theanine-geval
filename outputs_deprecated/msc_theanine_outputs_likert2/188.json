Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make?\nSpeaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it.\nSpeaker A: I would love to, I enjoy cooking so maybe you can teach me to make it, too?\nSpeaker B: Yeah definitely! I know you like hot foods, so if you learn and can make them fresh it will taste amazing. Have you tried any new foods lately?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A finds cooking helpful for stress relief, while Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe.\nSpeaker A wakes up early in the morning to catch waves, while Speaker B likes to eat huge steaks after snowboarding.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful context about the interests and backgrounds of Speaker A and Speaker B in relation to cooking. Knowing that Speaker A finds cooking helpful for stress relief could inform the conversation about sharing recipes and cooking together. Similarly, understanding that Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe could support the dialogue in terms of why sharing or teaching the recipe is meaningful. However, the parts about Speaker A catching waves in the morning and Speaker B enjoying steaks after snowboarding seem unrelated to the current dialogue context, which focuses on cooking and sharing recipes. The MEMORY lacks a natural connection or causality between these unrelated activities and the ongoing conversation. Thus, while there are useful elements, the entirety of the MEMORY is not cohesively relevant."
