Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well?\nSpeaker B: The older one seems to like it while the youngest cannot be bothered. Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A loves spending time with his sons, who have been out of town for a while and are leaving again in a few months. His boys will be coming for winter break from Europe. Speaker A's younger son would be jealous of Speaker B's sons' European tour, as the youngest one is addicted to social media and video games. Speaker A's sons play video games and listen to music in their rooms. Additionally, Speaker A has two sons who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next. At least one of Speaker A's sons is in a relationship with a Spanish girlfriend, while the other is secretive and possibly gay.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information about Speaker A's sons that could contribute to generating a response related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically about spending time with them and their travel plans. However, the memory includes extraneous details about video games, social media, and relationships that are not directly connected to the dialogue. Additionally, some sentences are disjointed, and the connection between the younger son being jealous and the discussion on ice skating needs clearer causality. Redundant information about speaker A's sons should be simplified to improve clarity and helpfulness."
