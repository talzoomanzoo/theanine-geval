Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \nSpeaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!).\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B travels frequently for work and misses their wife and kids. This experience has made Speaker B empathize with Speaker A, who is a runner working on improving their mile time and training for a marathon. Speaker B, as a motivational speaker, understands the importance of staying motivated and focused on goals. \nSpeaker B, originally from San Francisco and enjoying fishing and the outdoors, got into motivational speaking to battle their own depression and anxiety. This personal journey led Speaker B to joke about combining fishing with feeling depressed, showing a unique perspective on managing emotions. \nSpeaker A, a runner who dislikes traveling but has visited 20 countries, is dedicated to improving their running performance. Speaker A recognizes the value of motivation in achieving success and dreams, which aligns with Speaker B's job as a motivational speaker. Speaker A even suggested a way for Speaker B to stay active and positive when feeling down.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's awesome to hear! Your passion for motivating others really shines through. I'll definitely keep you in mind for motivating my friend to start running again.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a relevant response. It establishes that Speaker B is a motivational speaker who has experience dealing with personal challenges such as depression and anxiety, which can be insightful for their motivational work. This background could be used by Speaker B to relate to Speaker A's motivation-related conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The shared topic of motivation and the empathy Speaker B feels due to personal experiences, such as frequently traveling for work and missing family, parallel Speaker A's running goals. However, the MEMORY includes a lot of extraneous details like Speaker A's travel history and Speaker B's fishing hobbies, which may not directly connect to the current dialogue. The connections and causalities between memories are present but not entirely coherent or directly relevant to the ongoing conversation, making it moderately useful."
