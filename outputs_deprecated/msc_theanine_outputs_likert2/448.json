Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast.\nSpeaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project.\nSpeaker A: Quite a few, but it wasn't too crowded. It was a nice change of scenery. What kind of project are you working on?\nSpeaker B: I'm sure the student appreciate that. You teach as a group as apposed to one-on-one right? And one of the companies I work for had their system hit with a virus so I've been upgraded their software to debug the system.\nSpeaker A: I teach group classes and one on one, but I was the student today. I specialize in jiu-jitsu but today I got to be the student in a taekwondo class. \nSpeaker B: That's even better, learning is a life-long journey. How are you class on martial art history? When you have time teach me too, I'd love to learn. \nSpeaker A: It's been a little stressful lately, because finals are coming up...but I'm confident in that class. I could've aced it before I even started! I'll definitely get started with you after finals.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is a college student who teaches jiu-jitsu and is lactose intolerant. Today, however, Speaker A is a student in a taekwondo class and is enjoying the change of scenery. \nSpeaker A is planning to take summer courses soon and is very active, enjoying martial arts. In addition, Speaker A is enrolled in a class on the history of martial arts and is majoring in athletic training. Both Speaker A and Speaker B are interested in martial arts and enjoy learning new things.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that helps a language model, representing Speaker B, generate a better response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It concisely summarizes key points, such as Speaker A's role as both a teacher and student in martial arts, and their academic pursuits in athletic training and martial arts history. The MEMORY also highlights Speaker A's and Speaker B's shared interest in martial arts, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. These connections and details support maintaining a natural conversational flow and exploring related topics. While the MEMORY is overall well-constructed, some additional details on how Speaker B relates to the ongoing conversation (e.g., their own martial arts interests or professional work) could make it even more connected and contextual."
