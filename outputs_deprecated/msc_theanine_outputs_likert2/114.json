Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok? \nSpeaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish?\nSpeaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus!\nSpeaker B: Oh that sounds absolutely fabulous. Are you going to get a free dessert, as well?\nSpeaker A: Yes, I am thinking about trying either the new eclairs, or their tres leches cake with fresh raspberry jam sauce and lemon drizzle! I have too many good options to pick from! What one would you pick?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is interested in going rock climbing with Speaker A. Speaker A enjoys the interaction with people at work and the variety of experiences that come with it. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\nSpeaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit. Speaker A owns a restaurant and recently experienced a fire incident but managed to put it out. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy. Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule.\nSpeaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit, which causes Speaker A to enjoy the interaction with people at work and the variety of experiences that come with it.

    "raw_prediction": "I would go for the tres leches cake with fresh raspberry jam sauce and lemon drizzle. It sounds like a delicious choice!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A working at a restaurant, which connects to the conversation about the new dish and free meals. Speaker A's enjoyment of work and the busy schedule are also mentioned, aligning with the context of trying out new menu items. However, the MEMORY contains redundant information and lacks a strong causality or connection between statements. There are repeated mentions of Speaker A working at a restaurant and enjoying interactions, without further development or new insights. The fact about inviting Speaker B to visit is relevant but doesn't add much value unless it ties directly into the context of sharing experiences over the new menu item. Overall, the MEMORY provides a basic level of helpful insight but could be more cohesive and relevant to the ongoing conversation."
