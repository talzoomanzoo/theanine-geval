Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\nSpeaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk?\nSpeaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous.\nSpeaker B: That sounds amazing! Did you bring a pet? I love doing the harder trails with my dog. Sometimes, it's very peaceful to get away from everything.\nSpeaker A: No, I don't have any pets; my apartment seems too small for a dog and I would worry about them being lonely all day when I'm at work. I was thinking about getting a pair of cats, but I haven't committed yet. How nice fo ryou to have company when you're walking though! What kind of dog do you have?\nSpeaker B: Cats can be nice! I used to have cats, but am allergic to them and had to give them to my friend. I have an Australian Kelpie who is a rescue. She is very energetic and smart!\nSpeaker A: I had cats as a child and I think that they're a bit easier to care for than dogs, especially in the city. I am a dog lover as well though; Australian Kelpies are gorgeous! What is her name? Does she walk well off-leash?\nSpeaker B: Yes, cats are very smart and clean. Mine used to bring me a mouse to throw for her, just like a dog! And if you have 2 cats, they play with each other! Mine would run up and down the halls in the middle of the night, haha. Her name is Kyrie, and she walks off leash and is very obedient. Dogs might be hard to keep in your small apartment though, since Kyrie likes to play in the field, run with cars along the fence row, and herd goats. \nSpeaker A: Oh wow! So Kyrie is a working dog? She helps your dad out on the farm?\nSpeaker B: She herds them for fun, haha. Goats mostly graze wherever they like in the fields, but she likes to group them up and walk them into a pen. My grandpa says it's from her cattle herding heritage.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B and Speaker A both have a love for nature and animals. Speaker A also shares a passion for reading fantasy books like \"A Game of Thrones\" and enjoys audiobooks. Speaker B, on the other hand, is an artist who incorporates nature into their work and is interested in Pilates but dislikes strict exercise routines. Speaker A, a city dweller, walks to work and stresses the significance of maintaining proper form during exercise to avoid injuries.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Kyrie sounds like a fascinating dog with a strong instinct for herding! It must be entertaining to watch her in action.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some potentially relevant information about Speaker A and Speaker B, such as their love for nature and Speaker A's city lifestyle. However, the MEMORY does not directly pertain to the specificity of the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which revolves around recent interactions about pets, particularly dogs and cats, and their appropriateness for their respective living environments. The memory lacks a direct connection to the conversation topics and does not provide detailed insights or causality that would help develop the context further. The information about Speaker Aâ€™s love for fantasy books and audiobooks, and Speaker B being an artist, while interesting, do not significantly contribute to generating a fitting response regarding the current topic of discussion. The coherence between these pieces of information and the context provided is weak. Hence, the MEMORY does not serve as an especially helpful guide for Speaker A in the given dialogue context."
