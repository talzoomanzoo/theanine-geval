Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer?\nSpeaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to?\nSpeaker A: The museum has all sorts of galleries.  It has a sculpture garden outside.  I mostly like the impressionist paintings.  I like Van Gogh.  Was your concert outdoors?\nSpeaker B: Yes. That way they could have a fireworks show too. I love fireworks. Have you ever seen the fireworks at the Disney castle?\nSpeaker A: No, but I have been to Disney World in Florida.  I love fireworks too.  I want to get married on the 4th of July.  That was we will have a national holiday and fireworks for us every year!  It sounds like you've been to Disneyland?\n\nMEMORY:\n- Speaker A enjoys going to museums and trying different foods. This leads to Speaker A planning to do lots of shopping during their trip.\n- Speaker B has 2 older and 1 younger brother, and their father used to be a farmer. Speaker B was born in Brazil, specifically in San Paulo. Speaker A is interested in music concerts and planning a trip to Sao Paulo. Speaker A plans to do lots of shopping during their trip.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information that could be helpful, such as Speaker A's interest in museums, which is mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT when Speaker A discusses going to an art museum. However, the other aspects of the MEMORY, like the details about Speaker B's family background or Speaker A's plans to travel to Sao Paulo and shop, do not have a direct connection to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. These details lack causality or relevancy to the ongoing conversation about concerts, fireworks, and museum visits. As such, the MEMORY overall provides limited helpful information for generating a relevant next response."
