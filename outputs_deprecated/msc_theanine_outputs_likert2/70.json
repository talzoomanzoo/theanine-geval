Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play? \nSpeaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music.\nSpeaker A: ah right, who's your favourite rock band?\nSpeaker B: I'm big fan of aerosmith. When do you learn music. Whom teach you?\nSpeaker A: aerosmith are great, have you ever seen them live? I have been playing drums since i was a kid, my father taught me when I was young and from then on I just taught myself\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys listening to Sublime a lot while relaxing on the beach and is looking forward to taking a break from work to go fishing. Speaker B also finds fishing easier than surfing but is interested in trying surfing. Additionally, Speaker B is willing to teach Speaker A how to fish and cook.\n\nSpeaker A was good at writing in school, while Speaker B was bad at math and preferred fishing. This caused Speaker A to be in a band and play music, possibly as a musician. Speaker B, on the other hand, is a passionate cook who enjoys making Italian dishes like pasta, risotto, and pizza.\n\nSpeaker A is in a band where they play the drums and write music, with 4 members including the singer who is their best friend. Their band visited Italy, Uzbekistan, and smaller countries in Central and South America.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some insights into Speaker B's interests and hobbies (e.g., enjoying Sublime, fishing, and cooking) which might be relevant for a more in-depth conversation about hobbies or passions but not directly helpful for responding to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT discussing rock music and playing instruments. There is a mention of Speaker A playing the drums, which is relevant as it aligns with the context. However, there is minimal connectedness or causality between the dialogues and the memories. The memory lacks any specific linkages between musical instruments or rock music, and current conversational topics, which are crucial in this scenario. Therefore, the memory is not naturally structured to build or contribute directly to the subsequent dialogue."
