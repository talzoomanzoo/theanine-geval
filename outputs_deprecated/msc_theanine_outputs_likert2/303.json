Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods.\nSpeaker B: Oh that sounds fun! What is it about?\nSpeaker A: Black Widow is one of the character in the Marvel Avengers movies. Like Thor and Captain America. Have you seen any of those movies?\nSpeaker B: No I haven't seen any of those. What foods did you eat while watching the movie?\nSpeaker A: Wow, there are so many of the movies out there. Don't go see Black Widow without watching Avengers first. I had an amazing steak and vegetables on the side that were delicious. What is you favorite food? \nSpeaker B: Oh ok I definitely will watch those first! I love both steak and vegetables! I am a real foodie and love just about everything that isn't too strange to try lol.\nSpeaker A: Oh wow! Do you like sushi? I love it but the sea urchin is a little crazy lol. Have you ever eaten sea urchin?\nSpeaker B: I have never tried sea urchin or sushi but I do like crab legs and shrimp! Do you ever consider any foods to be good for healing? I find that you do healing very fascinating!\nSpeaker A: Yes, in fact I consider almost all foods to either be healing, harmful or neutral. In my opinion people should choose foods based on how they want to feel. Sushi is fresh and healthy so I considerate it to be very healing.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B expressed interest in trying healing methods mentioned by Speaker A. Speaker A finds being on the water therapeutic and relaxing. Speaker B goes sailing during the summer for the best \"scenery.\"\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided does contain some potentially relevant information, such as Speaker B's interest in healing methods and recreational activities like sailing. However, it lacks direct references or connections to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which revolves around movies, food preferences, and healing properties of foods. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it included more directly connected or causally relevant details from past interactions that align with the ongoing conversation topics in the dialogue. The sentences in the MEMORY do not clearly demonstrate a natural flow or connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which limits its helpfulness."
