Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok? \nSpeaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish?\nSpeaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys working at the restaurant due to the interaction with people and the variety of experiences it brings. This includes getting two free meals per week and taking home leftover baked goods. Speaker A also owns a restaurant and recently dealt with a fire incident, but managed to put it out. Despite the busy schedule, Speaker A finds joy in working there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds delicious! I can't wait to see the picture of the Chicken Parmesan with red pepper marinara.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that could help in generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker A's enjoyment of working at the restaurant, which ties into their excitement about the new menu dish. The mention of two free meals per week is also related as Speaker A anticipates trying the dish for free. However, details about owning a restaurant and dealing with a fire incident seem less relevant to the immediate context of discussing a menu item. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it focused more on information directly pertinent to the specific context of the current dialogue, which is primarily about menu additions and food excitement."
