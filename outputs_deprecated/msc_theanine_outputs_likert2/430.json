Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing?\nSpeaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha!\nSpeaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes?\nSpeaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe. \nSpeaker A: You make them sounds so fascinating. Will you take them with you to your college dorm? \nSpeaker B: I'll be living off campus, so absolutely. How about you? Are you staying in the dorms?\nSpeaker A: I'm glad your taking them with you. My mum wants me to stay in dorms. But I think I just want my own place, less drama and more freedom that way.\nSpeaker B: Yup. My parents wanted me to do the same thing...for \"that experience\". To be honest, I don't want it. It'd just be a distraction! \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is working on becoming an Eagle Scout and volunteers at a research lab. Speaker A plans to work with humans in neuroscience to help cure neurological diseases. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n\nSpeaker A is working on becoming an Eagle Scout and volunteers at a research lab. Speaker B is excited about taking neuroscience classes next year. Speaker B's classes related to neuroscience will start next year.\n\nSpeaker B is a veteran and knows of Eagle Scout projects for veterans, including one that helps dispose of American flags correctly. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I totally get that. Sometimes it's better to have your own space for focus and independence.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains multiple pieces of information that are relevant to the context of the dialogue. It mentions Speaker B having two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel, which connects with the current conversation in the dialogue. Additionally, it hints at both speakers' interests in science and neuroscience, which might be useful for generating responses about their future plans or shared interests. However, several sentences are repetitive or not directly relevant to the current dialogue focus, such as the details about the Eagle Scout and Speaker B being a veteran. These elements are not integrated well with the conversation about college living arrangements and preferences for pets versus humans. Overall, the MEMORY provides helpful context but lacks some cohesion and relevance to the specific direction of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
