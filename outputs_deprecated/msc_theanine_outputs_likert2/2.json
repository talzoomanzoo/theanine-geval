Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico. How long do you plan to stay?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break. This excitement led Speaker B to dye their hair with henna and enjoy experimenting with different hair colors. Speaker A used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one. Both Speaker A and Speaker B have a sense of humor, as seen by their use of \"lol\" in the conversation. Speaker A has a granddaughter who is a cosmetologist and helped dye their hair in streaks. Speaker A is getting their hair dyed turquoise by their youngest grandchild, who wants to pursue hairdressing as a profession. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet, showing their excitement for the upcoming adventure.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's excitement about a trip, which could be related to their trip to Costa Rica. However, the MEMORY also includes several details that are not directly connected to the dialogue, such as Speaker A's experiences with hair dye and their granddaughter. These details do not have a clear connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT or help generate a relevant response about Speaker B's trip to Costa Rica. The overall structure lacks a clear flow of causality or connection between the events, making it less helpful for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
