Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me?\nSpeaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has blue eyes and blonde hair, while Speaker B is balding and overweight. Speaker A invited Speaker B to visit and mentioned looking into flights. Speaker A has invited Speaker B to visit them and is excited about the trip.\nSpeaker A drives a smart car and used to have a long commute in Alaska. Speaker B is interested in visiting Alaska and mentions getting blackout curtains due to the midnight sun. Speaker A invited Speaker B to visit and mentioned looking into flights. Speaker B is planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\nSpeaker A drives a smart car and used to have a long commute in Alaska. Speaker A has visited Alaska and describes it as beautiful, suggesting cheap flights to Anchorage. Speaker B found flights that work for their schedule and price and will be visiting Speaker A in a couple of weeks. Speaker A plans to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "The weather has been a bit unpredictable, but it's starting to warm up. Hopefully, the prices for flights will drop soon so you can come visit!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information that aids Speaker A in generating a relevant response in the current dialogue context. It contains relevant background information about their past interactions, such as Speaker A inviting Speaker B to visit and the discussions about flights. Speaker B's interest in visiting and specifically mentioning a concert and outdoor activities tie in with the current focus on watching airfare and the travel plans. Additionally, details about Speaker A's experiences in Alaska and suggestions for activities strengthen the context for the ongoing arrangements for the visit. However, there are some repetitive sentences, and some details seem less directly relevant (such as physical descriptions or the specific type of car) or scattered which slightly disrupt the natural flow, preventing it from receiving a perfect score."
