Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\nSpeaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\nSpeaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\nSpeaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.\nSpeaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe?\nSpeaker B: There is some weird chemical mix that I really do not mess with.  It is easy to clean up.  I try to stay away from this part of the movies.  I know what it should look like and that we want to keep everyone safe when using the fake blood.\nSpeaker A: Chemicals!  Do the actors hate working with it then?  I can imagine they are a pretty high maintenance bunch.  Do they worry about the blood messing with their looks?\nSpeaker B: Our actors are pretty amateur.  No big name ones so they are really good to work with.  Hey, how about you?  How is your interview practice going?  I am pretty sure you be excellent during it!\nSpeaker A: I think this discussion is helping me with making small talk, so thanks.  I just have to try and remember who i am and try to sell my good points.\nSpeaker B: That is a good approach.  I suppose you have been doing research on the company you are interviewing with?  I find it always helps to know the company as best you can for an interview.\nSpeaker A: Yes. Thanks for the reminder.  I have a couple of more companies to research today.  Of course, it is always interesting to figure out what a company's corporate culture is. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A used to help their father on a farm in the past, while Speaker B's dad works on smaller projects and has never been involved in a major Hollywood film. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\nSpeaker A recently moved to a new city and has two older brothers. Speaker A has recently received a call for a job interview and is excited about it. Speaker A is preparing for an upcoming interview and is nervous about it. Speaker A is nervous about an upcoming interview and wishes for a government job like Speaker B's.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provided includes information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes the connection between Speaker A and Speaker B by mentioning that Speaker B is involved in creating horror movies, which aligns with the conversation in the context about Speaker B working in horror film production. Furthermore, it mentions Speaker A's upcoming interview, which connects to the dialogue about Speaker A preparing for interviews and gaining confidence through conversation, hinting at their professional aspirations. The MEMORY can help guide the language model in understanding the charactersâ€™ backgrounds and current situations, aiding in generating more contextually appropriate responses. However, the connections between sentences in MEMORY could be even more cohesive to fully capture the causality and develop past interactions, which is why it didn't receive a perfect score."
