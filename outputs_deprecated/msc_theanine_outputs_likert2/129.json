Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well?\nSpeaker B: I haven't!

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that could help in generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The fact that Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt is directly relevant, given the discussion about martial arts and the invitation to visit the dojo. Additionally, Speaker B's involvement in activities like lifeguarding is somewhat connected to the context where guest passes to the pool were mentioned. However, other elements of the MEMORY, such as Speaker B's interest in IT and attending football games, do not directly contribute to the immediate dialogue about martial arts and dining plans. The memories are somewhat connected, but not all aspects are immediately relevant to aiding in a natural continuation of the conversation."
