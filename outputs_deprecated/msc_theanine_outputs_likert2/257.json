Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\nSpeaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\nSpeaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\nSpeaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.\nSpeaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe?\nSpeaker B: There is some weird chemical mix that I really do not mess with.  It is easy to clean up.  I try to stay away from this part of the movies.  I know what it should look like and that we want to keep everyone safe when using the fake blood.\nSpeaker A: Chemicals!  Do the actors hate working with it then?  I can imagine they are a pretty high maintenance bunch.  Do they worry about the blood messing with their looks?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A recently moved to a new city and has two older brothers. Speaker A has recently received a call for a job interview and is excited about it. Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations. Speaker B's father was involved in producing horror movies, which influenced Speaker B's favorite genre. Speaker A also likes mid-century design and is a fan of horror movies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Actually, most actors are pretty chill about it. They understand it's all part of the job.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that is potentially useful for the language model when generating a response for Speaker B within the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it identifies key details about Speaker B's background, such as the fact that Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad and that their fatherâ€™s involvement in the genre influenced their interests. This context aligns well with the current discussion about horror movies and Speaker B's role in producing them. Moreover, it could allow Speaker B to elaborate or reference their familial influence or experiences in response to Speaker A's queries. The connection between Speaker A and Speaker B regarding their shared interest in horror movies is also made apparent. However, some elements like Speaker A's move to a new city or their job interview excitement, while interesting, don't appear immediately relevant to the present dialogue about movie production and blood on set. Thus, while the MEMORY is overall useful and relevant, not all details are directly applicable to the immediate flow of conversation."
