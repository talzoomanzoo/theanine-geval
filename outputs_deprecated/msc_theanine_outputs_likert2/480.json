Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \nSpeaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!).\nSpeaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol\nSpeaker B: I am up for the challenge! I have a few tricks up my sleeve to deal with people like you.\nSpeaker A: Oh geez that makes me sound difficult.lol  Do you have any new speeches coming up?\nSpeaker B: Nope, I just cleared my schedule until the Alps marathon that you're training for. It's just you and me until you break that finish line. I'm going to start sending you a motivational quote every morning at 4 am when I want you to wake up.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has run a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding. This experience led Speaker A to seek advice on how to recover from marathon training. Speaker A then invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and planning to meet at the beach at 0600. Speaker B got into motivational speaking because they needed it themselves to battle depression and anxiety, which was suggested by Speaker A to combine with something more active to avoid dwelling on negative thoughts. Speaker B, who travels frequently for work and misses their wife and kids, also finds solace in fishing and the outdoors, similar to their background in San Francisco.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'll definitely need those motivational quotes at 4 am to get me out of bed for our training sessions. Looking forward to pushing through the tough moments together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and helpful context for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives insights into Speaker B's experience with marathon running, which is directly related to the topic of motivating Speaker A for the Alps marathon. Speaker B's background in motivational speaking, triggered by personal struggles with depression and anxiety, also correlates well with the ongoing theme of motivation in the dialogue. Furthermore, the MEMORY mentions a past interaction when Speaker A sought Speaker B's advice on marathon recovery and extended an invitation to train together. This provides a deeper understanding of their relationship and supports the dialogue's focus on motivation and training. However, some elements, such as Speaker B's travel for work, missing family, or liking fishing, are only tangentially connected and don't directly influence the dialogue, which prevents a perfect score."
