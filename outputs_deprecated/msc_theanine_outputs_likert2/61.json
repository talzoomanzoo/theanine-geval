Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\nSpeaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk?\nSpeaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous.\nSpeaker B: That sounds amazing! Did you bring a pet? I love doing the harder trails with my dog. Sometimes, it's very peaceful to get away from everything.\nSpeaker A: No, I don't have any pets; my apartment seems too small for a dog and I would worry about them being lonely all day when I'm at work. I was thinking about getting a pair of cats, but I haven't committed yet. How nice fo ryou to have company when you're walking though! What kind of dog do you have?\nSpeaker B: Cats can be nice! I used to have cats, but am allergic to them and had to give them to my friend. I have an Australian Kelpie who is a rescue. She is very energetic and smart!\nSpeaker A: I had cats as a child and I think that they're a bit easier to care for than dogs, especially in the city. I am a dog lover as well though; Australian Kelpies are gorgeous! What is her name? Does she walk well off-leash?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, who lives in the country, loves nature, and works with animals, enjoys walking through nature for work. Speaker A, a city dweller who walks to work instead of driving, is interested in Pilates but dislikes the idea of having to follow specific steps in exercise. Speaker A, who also enjoyed reading 'Redwall' growing up and keeps an eye out for similar books, recommends \"A Game of Thrones\" by George R. Speaker A, a fan of the Game of Thrones series and audiobooks, acknowledges Speaker B's need for inspiration and asks about their new artwork.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some information about Speaker A and Speaker B, but it is not very helpful for generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY includes details about Speaker B's lifestyle and Speaker A's interests that are not relevant to the current dialogue, such as Speaker A's interest in Pilates and books, and Speaker B's work with animals, which do not connect directly to the conversation about nature walks and pets. Additionally, there is a lack of coherence and causality between the MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making it difficult to see how this information can facilitate the continuity of the conversation in a meaningful way."
