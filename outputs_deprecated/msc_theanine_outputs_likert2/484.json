Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \nSpeaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!).\nSpeaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol\nSpeaker B: I am up for the challenge! I have a few tricks up my sleeve to deal with people like you.\nSpeaker A: Oh geez that makes me sound difficult.lol  Do you have any new speeches coming up?\nSpeaker B: Nope, I just cleared my schedule until the Alps marathon that you're training for. It's just you and me until you break that finish line. I'm going to start sending you a motivational quote every morning at 4 am when I want you to wake up.\nSpeaker A: Wow 4 am.  Is it too late to change my mind?lol\nSpeaker B: Yes. We have an iron-clad written agreement. Tell me how I'm doing so far. Is this the most motivated you've ever been in your entire life?\nSpeaker A: No, but that's why I have you.  You're going to push me to do the things I can't bring myself to do.  I'll have more motivation tomorrow.  Today was a long work day.lol\nSpeaker B: I'm going to try a new motivational technique with you. Would you be more frightened by a spider or a snake. I need to know before we meet up this weekend.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A, a runner who has visited 20 countries, is now training for marathons and seeking advice on how to recover, which caused Speaker A to invite Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600.\n\n2. Speaker A, a runner who has visited 20 countries, is now training for marathons and seeking advice on how to recover, which is a similar topic to Speaker B being a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks, and Speaker B joked about combining fishing with feeling depressed, and mentioned taking young boys to the pond during school hours.\n\n3. Speaker B, from San Francisco, who enjoys fishing and the outdoors, has run a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding, and wants Speaker A, who is training for marathons and seeking advice on how to recover, to combine something more active with feeling depressed to avoid dwelling on negative thoughts.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY consists of pieces of information about Speaker A and Speaker B. However, it provides limited relevance and cohesion with the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Here's why:\n\n1. Detailed Background Info: MEMORY gives some background on Speaker A's running experience and Speaker B's motivational speaking, but these details don't directly contribute to generating an effective or contextually relevant response in the current dialogue scenario.\n \n2. Lack of Connection: The MEMORY talks about interactions and past scenarios, such as Speaker A training for marathons and Speaker B's experiences, but fails to establish a clear connection or causal relationship with the current conversation thread. It doesn't meaningfully support the dialogue about motivational speaking and training challenges.\n\n3. Unrelated Details: Specific details such as fishing, taking boys to the pond, and combining activities with feeling depressed appear unrelated and do not naturally connect to the given context of marathon training and motivation discussed in the conversation. \n\nThus, although the MEMORY contains snippets of character backgrounds, it lacks the focused, context-based connection needed to naturally progress or enrich the dialogue, resulting in a low helpfulness score."
