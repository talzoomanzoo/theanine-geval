Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me?\nSpeaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week?\nSpeaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day\nSpeaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through\nSpeaker A: Actually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to it. Do you think I will need to rent a car when I'm there, or is it possible to walk and bike in the summer? I always picture huge amounts of snow but I'm not sure if it's like that all year round.\nSpeaker A: I would definitely recommend looking for a rental car to have on hand. There is a town within walking distance from me, but it can be dangerous to walk with the wolves and elk around, especially at night.\nSpeaker B: I imagine so!!! I wouldn't want to run into a wolf! Ok. I will add car rental to my plans. Do you get scared with your dogs, that you will run into wildilfe like that?\nSpeaker A: I think I'm more afraid of the wildlife than my dogs are. If I had to, I think I could muster the courage to face the animals out here, but I will happily avoid them when possible. With you around, I'd feel much better, as well. How do you feel about being that close to wildlife?\nSpeaker B: Well I don't have a lot of experience with that but I guess I'd be ok as long as I knew what to do. Most of the wildlife I see is squirrels, pigeons, and the occasional possum. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A used to have a long commute in Alaska, and now drives a smart car. They described Alaska as beautiful, suggesting cheap flights to Anchorage, which caused Speaker A to invite Speaker B to visit and look into flights. This led to Speaker B planning to visit Speaker A, interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n\nSpeaker A used to have a long commute in Alaska, and now drives a smart car. They mentioned the \"midnight sun\" phenomenon in Alaska where the sun does not set during the summer, as well as the wildlife like elk and wolves. This caused Speaker A to mention making poached eggs for breakfast and taking sleds pulled by dogs.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "It's definitely a different experience being around larger wildlife compared to squirrels and pigeons. I'll make sure to give you some tips on what to do in case you do encounter any animals during your visit.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some background information on Speaker A's past experiences in Alaska, which could be potentially interesting but doesn't directly contribute to generating a relevant next response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The details about a long commute in Alaska, driving a smart car, and the \"midnight sun\" phenomenon, while informative, are not directly useful for the current conversation about planning a visit and activities like concerts and car rentals. Furthermore, the suggestion of activities such as petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour lack logical connection to the existing conversation where Speaker A warns about wolves and suggests renting a car for safety reasons. The MEMORY needs better alignment and coherence with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT to be helpful in developing the conversation further."
