Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue.\nSpeaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad.\nSpeaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs!\nSpeaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours?\nSpeaker A: Ikea! Their furniture is not to expensive and they have all kinds of furniture that'll go with whatever scheme you're going for. What kind of patio furniture were you looking for? Like a barbeque, chairs, hammock? \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is in the process of renovating their house to meet their living standards with their pets. This includes recently purchasing purple sofas for their home and considering adding more colorful elements to the room to make the purple sofas work. Speaker A is looking to redecorate their house and likes purple furniture, having recently bought new furniture for their house, including a couch, recliner, and patio furniture. They both enjoy barbecuing and have a love for pets, leading to them discussing furniture and home decor choices. This has caused Speaker A and Speaker B to plan to meet up to discuss the furniture exchange, with Speaker A offering devices to keep bugs away and sharing the product names with Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I was thinking of getting a nice outdoor dining set with some comfortable chairs. Thanks for the tip about Ikea, I'll check out their patio furniture selection.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker B is renovating their house and recently purchased purple sofas, which ties back to the conversation about color schemes. It also touches on their shared interest in barbecuing and love for pets, which aligns with their planning to meet for a barbecue. However, it could be more directly relevant and better structured if it included more specific past interactions or decisions they made about furniture and home decor, considering the current conversation about patio furniture and color scheme. The connection between purchasing purple sofas and the discussion about color schemes could be made clearer, and there is a lack of detail about Speaker B's opinion on color schemes beyond needing to make the purple sofas work. Additionally, some parts of the MEMORY, such as Speaker A looking to redecorate their own house, do not seem directly related to the current dialogue context."
