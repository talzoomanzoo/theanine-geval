Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends?\nSpeaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is considering doing sledding with dogs while in Alaska, but needs to find out if it is daylight or darkness there. Speaker B's friend mentioned Alaska doesn't have 24-hour days like where they are. \nSpeaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking. Speaker B is unsure about other activities besides hiking in Alaska. \nSpeaker B is going to Alaska for a vacation in two weeks and has flying experience. Speaker A mentions outdoor activities planned for Alaska, such as hiking. \nSpeaker A has the impression that Alaska is cold and snowy, wondering if there are ski slopes there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "You should check the daylight hours in Alaska, especially if you're planning on doing activities like sledding with dogs.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information that corresponds to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's interest in dog sledding and the need to know about daylight conditions in Alaska. It also mentions that Speaker B's friend informed them about Alaska's unique daylight cycle, which directly relates to the current conversation. Additionally, it includes Speaker A's knowledge about Alaska's cold and snowy conditions, which is somewhat relevant to the context of outdoor activities like sledding. However, the MEMORY also contains extraneous information about Speaker A's familiarity with other activities and plans that are not immediately relevant to the current dialogue. The connection between certain sentences is not fully apparent, making the overall causality and relevance less clear. Therefore, while some parts of the MEMORY are useful, others are not as directly helpful for generating a response in the present context."
