Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read.\nSpeaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting? \nSpeaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far.\nSpeaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys spending time with their grandchildren, who are old enough to entertain themselves using technology or watching TV. Speaker A suggests taking naps during quiet times and mentions watching her grandkids. \nSpeaker A and Speaker B discuss their children getting older and becoming more independent. \nSpeaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix. Speaker B is considering volunteering at an animal shelter when her son starts school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that can be useful for Speaker A to maintain a conversation regarding their personal interests and daily activities, such as spending time with grandchildren and enjoying certain types of books. However, it lacks a cohesive narrative or causality that directly connects the past interactions to the current dialogue context. The information about Speaker B considering volunteering provides some personal insight, but it's loosely connected to the ongoing conversation about Speaker A's choice in books and break time. Overall, while the MEMORY has relevant details, it's not very cohesive, limiting its help in shaping a natural continuation of the dialogue."
