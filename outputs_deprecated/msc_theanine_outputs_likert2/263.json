Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go?\nSpeaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is on their way to college and studying sports medicine, feeling overwhelmed by their mother's strictness and eager to finish school to escape it.\nSpeaker B has sports medicine training and is taking an exam in that subject, causing them to feel pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\nSpeaker B has been getting all A's in the sports medicine class, which changed Speaker A's struggle to maintain good grades as they find gym to be the only subject they excel in.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It offers background on Speaker B's academic situation and emotional state, which can be useful to Speaker A when responding to the discussion about exams. The MEMORY explains Speaker B's focus on sports medicine, and their pressure to maintain high grades due to their mother's expectations. However, the connection between the different pieces of information could be clearer, as they feel somewhat disjointed. While the MEMORY gives insight into Speaker B's challenges, the details about Speaker A's struggles with grades or the relevance of gym class do not significantly inform the current conversation, which is centered on the upcoming exams rather than past grades. This results in a moderately helpful memory that could be improved by emphasizing more causality or development directly related to their current exam preparations."
