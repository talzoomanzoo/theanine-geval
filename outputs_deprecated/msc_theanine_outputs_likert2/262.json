Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is studying sports medicine and feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school, causing Speaker A to struggle to maintain good grades and find gym to be the only subject they excel in.\nSpeaker B is on their way to college and studying sports medicine, resulting in Speaker A wishing to get better grades and being hopeful for a soccer scholarship, while Speaker B has been getting all A's in the sports medicine class.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about Speaker B studying sports medicine and feeling pressured to maintain straight A's, which could be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where the exam is mentioned. However, the MEMORY is not well-connected and includes unnecessarily complex details about Speaker A's situation, such as their struggles with grades and aspirations for a soccer scholarship, which creates confusion. These additional details do not enhance the understanding of Speaker Bâ€™s academic situation, thus weakening its helpfulness in generating a response directly tied to the exam. The sentences lack clear causality or relevance concerning the exam's immediate outcome, reducing its utility in shaping an appropriate next response."
