Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive.\nSpeaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price?\nSpeaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music\nSpeaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it.\nSpeaker A: I'll keep trying! Have you had any luck lately?\nSpeaker B: No I haven't! I keep hoping that I will so I can buy my dreamhouse but I know the chances are low.\nSpeaker A: Would you move to the city? It'd be too much for me\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A, who was born and raised as a preacher's kid in the country and worked on a produce farm, mentions that Speaker B's kids could try milking cows on the farm, which Speaker B finds amusing. They then discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\n\nSpeaker A and Speaker B have a friendly interaction and part ways on a positive note after both buying lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n\nSpeaker A, who was born and raised as a preacher's kid in the country and worked on a produce farm, expresses interest in potentially moving out of the city and enjoying a more peaceful life on the farm. Speaker B is open to moving to the country to be further away from neighbors and buys 20 lotto tickets with the same numbers, aiming to get a bigger share of the jackpot if they win.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I can understand that. I actually prefer the peace and quiet of the countryside myself.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information regarding the ongoing conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It provides background on Speaker A's upbringing, which is connected to their discussion on potential living preferences (\"Would you move to the city? It'd be too much for me\"). It also details Speaker B's aspirations of winning the lotto for a dreamhouse, which directly relates to the current conversation about winning the lottery. Moreover, the MEMORY mentions previous interactions regarding the lotto, which connects to the current dialogue where both speakers discuss winning and buying tickets. While the MEMORY is indeed helpful and relevant, there are a few redundant details (e.g., repeating Speaker A's upbringing information) that don't directly contribute to the immediate context but still provide a coherent understanding of the speakers' past interactions and aspirations."
