Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well?\nSpeaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes?\nSpeaker A: I want to take some martial art classes at school next year. What do you sggest I try?\nSpeaker B: I mean I always recommend Karate since that's what I study! I can bring you by the dojo sometime if you want to see what it is like. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, who currently works as a lifeguard and practices karate, is considering a career change to the IT sector due to their computer skills and the growing demand for employees in that field. This decision comes as working as a lifeguard is physically demanding and not seen as a suitable long-term career option.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant background information about Speaker B, such as their practice in karate, which ties in with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B recommends karate. However, the additional details about Speaker B's career as a lifeguard and considering a change to the IT sector are not directly helpful or relevant to generating a response to the immediate dialogue context, which is focused on martial arts and Speaker A's interest in taking classes. These details do not contribute to the natural progression or relevance of the conversation. The information provided could be helpful if the conversation was about career options or personal interests beyond martial arts, but in this specific dialogue context, the connection is weak."
