Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities. \nSpeaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job. Speaker A is studying computer science and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I have thought about teaching as a potential career path. It seems like a stable and rewarding option.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides a good amount of relevant context to generate a proper next response. It contains information about both Speaker A and Speaker B’s academic and career interests. This is helpful, as it informs us about Speaker B's consideration of becoming a college professor in linguistics, which directly relates to the ongoing discussion about career options and teaching. It also tells us that Speaker B feels limited in job opportunities, which may influence Speaker B's response to Speaker A's suggestion about teaching. The information about Speaker A’s interests in computer science and teaching is also relevant as it ties back to the discussion about guaranteed jobs in teaching. Overall, the MEMORY is relatively well-structured, demonstrating the relevancy of past interactions to the current conversation, although it could slightly improve clarity on the causality between their career considerations."
