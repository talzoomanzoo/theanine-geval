Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\nSpeaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient! \nSpeaker A: Wow, that gives me a completely different perspective. You'd really be ok with seeing me? You don't think it would be a conflict of interest since we're friends?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys being around horses, involved in horse breeding and taking care of them. Speaker B is concerned about the cost of owning horses, including medical fees and expenses like horse shoes, and also considers the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories. \nSpeaker B's mom being a nurse and busy with work caused Speaker B to become a therapist, mentioning the ups and downs of the profession, and be a professional in a practice where it is illegal for them to have relationships with clients. \nSpeaker B, a therapist and a football fan supporting the Chiefs, talks about the profession's challenges and the legal restrictions on relationships with clients.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate your concern, but as a professional, I always maintain strict boundaries with my clients. I believe I could provide you with the support you need without any conflicts.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker B's profession as a therapist, which is connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where they discuss the nature of therapy and offer potential services to Speaker A. The memory details the challenges and legal restrictions of the profession, which could be pertinent given Speaker A's concern about a conflict of interest. Additionally, it touches on Speaker Bâ€™s background and motivations for becoming a therapist, which can provide deeper insight into Speaker B's responses. However, there are some elements in the memory, such as Speaker B's interest in football and Speaker A's involvement with horses, that are not directly relevant to the ongoing dialogue, diluting its direct helpfulness. Additionally, the memory could be structured better to highlight the causality and development of the conversation, particularly focusing on the legal and ethical aspects discussed in the context."
