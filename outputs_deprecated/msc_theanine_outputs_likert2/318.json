Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company? Do you build computers or work on programming?\nSpeaker B: I do like my job. My job is to troubleshoot issues between the hardware and software, so I get to work with both.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys reading books about ice cream, Disney World, and computers, which causes Speaker A to be open to meeting for lunch and be flexible with food choices. \nSpeaker B works for a computer company and is unable to change careers until their child graduates, hindering Speaker B's plans to take their child to Disney World. Speaker A is considering a career in dentistry but is also interested in working at Disney for happiness. \nSpeaker A, who works for a small local business with a demanding schedule, reacts by not having children and spending time working and reading, preferring late morning for a meeting.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "It's great that you get to work with both hardware and software. I find troubleshooting to be challenging yet rewarding.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information but is not inherently organized around the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The connections about both speakers' professional lives are conveyed, such as Speaker Bâ€™s job at a computer company and their inability to change careers until their child graduates. This information is useful for understanding the constraints on Speaker B's job situation. However, the additional details about personal interests in ice cream and Disney World, as well as career considerations and lifestyle choices of both speakers, such as potential career shifts and the impact of that on family plans, don't directly pertain to the questions asked in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Furthermore, the memory is structured in a rather disjointed manner and could be more clearly connected to causality or relevance to the specific conversation flow in the dialogue provided."
