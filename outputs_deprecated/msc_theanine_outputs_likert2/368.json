Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys gardening and reading, while Speaker B enjoys visiting the zoo. Speaker B's girlfriend loves pandas and penguins at the zoo and they visit every few weeks. Speaker B's girlfriend has a noisy cockatoo and Speaker B is thinking about adopting a kitten from a friend.\n2. Speaker A prefers cockatoos over kittens as pets, reacting to Speaker B's girlfriend having a noisy cockatoo.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend, which relates to Speaker A's question about the kittens. However, the rest of the MEMORY contains details about Speaker A's and B's personal interests and habits, which are not directly relevant to the topic of adopting a kitten. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it focused more explicitly on the context or reasons behind Speaker B's consideration of adoption and Speaker A's friend's kittens. The connection to the dialogue context is present but not strong or thoroughly developed."
