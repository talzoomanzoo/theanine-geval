Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me?\nSpeaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week?\nSpeaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day\nSpeaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through\nSpeaker A: Actually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has blue eyes and blonde hair, while Speaker B is balding and overweight. Speaker A plans to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit. Speaker A drives a smart car and used to have a long commute in Alaska. Speaker A has visited Alaska and describes it as beautiful, suggesting cheap flights to Anchorage. Speaker A's family is from the north, and they prefer the warmth of the south. Speaker B found flights that work for their schedule and price and will be visiting Speaker A in a couple of weeks.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some reasonably relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it includes details about Speaker A's plans to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts, which corresponds to the ongoing conversation about potential concerts to attend during Speaker B's visit. Moreover, it mentions that Speaker B found flights that work, indicating progress in their plans to visit, which is relevant to their discussion about airfare and timing the visit around concerts. However, the MEMORY also includes several details that are not directly relevant to the current conversation, such as Speaker A's physical appearance, car preference, or past living situation in Alaska, that could be seen as unnecessary in generating a response pertinent to this particular context. While there is some useful information, the MEMORY could be more focused on immediately relevant details or their development in relation to the conversation."
