Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast.\nSpeaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today?

I could've aced it before I even started! I'll definitely get started with you after finals.\nSpeaker B: Ahaha we;; for someone who's so passionate about martial arts I'm not surprised. Great, I'll try to be the best student I can. I'm starving, think I should grab some take-out from Sufi?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is planning to take summer courses soon and is very active, enjoying martial arts.

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "That sounds delicious, Sufi is always a good choice for take-out! I could go for some too after a long day of training.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information that can be useful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains details about Speaker A's active lifestyle, involvement in martial arts, and their educational pursuits, which are relevant to the conversation about martial arts classes and history. Similarly, information about Speaker B's software job and interest in the history of martial arts aligns with the context of the dialogue where Speaker B discusses a project related to software. However, parts of the MEMORY are repeated and there is an inconsistency regarding Speaker B's favorite restaurant Sufi, which is supposed to be in London, while they talk about current take-out in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Therefore, while the MEMORY is somewhat helpful, the repetition and occasional irrelevance of certain details prevent it from being rated a 5."
