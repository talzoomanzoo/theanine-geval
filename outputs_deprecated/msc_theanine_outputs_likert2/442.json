Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is very active, enjoying martial arts and is planning to take summer courses soon. Speaker A has never been out of the United States and thinks it would be nice to visit England. Speaker B enjoys visiting local restaurants in London. Speaker A is interested in trying new restaurants, mentioning Taco Bell as their favorite.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information related to Speaker A's activities and interests, like enjoying martial arts and trying new restaurants. Mentioning Speaker A's interest in visiting England and Speaker B's enjoyment of local restaurants in London could offer a potential direction for the conversation. However, the MEMORY lacks a direct connection or causality between the past interactions that would make it more relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The details about travel aspirations and local restaurant interests could be developed further to enhance their relevance and natural flow in the conversation."
