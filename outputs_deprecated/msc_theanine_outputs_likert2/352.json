Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on!\nSpeaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar.\nSpeaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general?\nSpeaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts.\nSpeaker A: How's learning to bake going in general, especially now that you're off desserts?\nSpeaker B: I one of those people how have to fail a couple of times before I get the hang of it, but I'm getting there.  Have you and the kids had any chance to go skiing lately?\nSpeaker A: Water skiing? Yes, last weekend. It was so much fun!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides limited helpfulness for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It does establish a connection between Speaker A and jello, which is relevant to the initial part of the conversation where Speaker B talks about teaching kids a jello recipe. However, the MEMORY primarily focuses on Speaker A's connection to jello and does not directly relate to Speaker B's situation or the development of the dialogue, such as Speaker B's concerns about consuming too much sugar or their progress in learning to bake. The relevance is minimal and does not sufficiently aid in generating a response to the ongoing conversation. Furthermore, the mention of a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes feels slightly disconnected from the current focus in the dialogue, as it doesn’t address or build upon Speaker B’s current experiences or queries."
