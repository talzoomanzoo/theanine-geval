    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing?\nSpeaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from?\nSpeaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there.\nSpeaker B: That's great. I have gotten my pets from the shelter and they seem happy I brought them home. I have a hard time saying no to them which is why I have so many pets. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs. Do you have a name in mind for your cat? \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A's brother might commission a family portrait from Speaker B, who has 5 dogs of different breeds and rats as pets but didn't include them in the portrait. Speaker B's prices for a portrait start at $5000 to pay for college tuition, and they are in college, paint on the side, and have five dogs and three rats. Speaker B thinks pit bulls are lovely and has one that is kind and sweet, and likes Persian cats, imagining their pets having interesting interactions. Speaker A is considering getting kittens and thinks rats can be smart. Speaker B is busy with school and taking care of their five dogs, so working at a doggy daycare would be too much, as they are working on other portraits and taking care of a sick dog.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that can be useful for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes background on Speaker B's interest in painting and portrays the connection between the two speakers in terms of their shared interest in pets. Memory also explains Speaker A's intentions and some details about Speaker Bâ€™s life, like their busy schedule and their pets, which gives context to their conversation. However, the memory could be improved by more directly connecting to details in the current ongoing dialogue, such as the current pet portrait or specific dynamics between Speaker A and B. While the MEMORY is informative, it may contain slightly extraneous details that might not directly aid in crafting the next most relevant response."
