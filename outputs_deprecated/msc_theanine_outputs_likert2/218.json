Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A's pet raccoon enjoys eating pizza because Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid.\n2. Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid, so Speaker A wants to have a pet raccoon and has a friend who found baby raccoons.\n3. Speaker B enjoys going on cruises for fun as Speaker A has been working at their job for almost 10 years and has only taken 3 vacations.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nThe MEMORY provided does not contain information that is helpful or relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While the name of Speaker A's pet raccoon, Journey, is mentioned in the context and memory, the rest of the details in MEMORY are either repetitive, irrelevant, or unrelated to the context. The inclusion of unrelated elements like Speaker B's enjoyment of cruises or a friend finding baby raccoons distracts from the context's focus on Journey eating a piece of pizza. The memory lacks meaningful connections or information that would support generating a well-informed response for Speaker B."
