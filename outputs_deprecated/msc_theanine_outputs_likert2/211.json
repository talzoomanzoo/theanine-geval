Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships!\nSpeaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!   I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field?\nSpeaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate?\nSpeaker B: I have another year- so this year is really important I get internships and start making connections in the field.   I love going to the beach too.  What happened with your knees that now cause you so much pain?\nSpeaker A: I think age has really been my knees downfall. I also used to hike a lot and I put a lot of pressure on my legs. That is great that you only have a year. Maybe when you graduate you can come hang out on the beach with me. I can't surf but I would love to watch you.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A mentions their neighbor John who loves soccer, which causes Speaker B to be interested in sports medicine and enjoy surfing. This leads Speaker A to offer advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field.\n\nSpeaker B's mother runs a local high school, and Speaker B is her only child. This connection leads Speaker B to go to the beach a lot and learn to surf from friends in Jersey. Speaker A suggests that surfing could be a way for Speaker B to make connections in the medical field.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a plan! I'll definitely take you up on that offer to hang out at the beach after I graduate. It'll be a nice break from the internship hunt.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some elements that can be linked to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly the mention of sports, internships, and the medical field. However, it does not capture the actual progression of the conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The connection between Speaker A's advice and Speaker B's interest in internships is not clearly developed or directly related to the current conversation. The MEMORY also introduces tangential details (e.g., Speaker B's mother's occupation) that are irrelevant to the current context and do not help in formulating a likely next response. Additionally, the potential helpfulness that could come from the discussion of beaches and surfing is not effectively indicated in MEMORY. Overall, the MEMORY is only marginally helpful as it fails to capture the natural flow and primary content of the actual DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
