Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well?\nSpeaker B: The older one seems to like it while the youngest cannot be bothered. Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon?\nSpeaker A: Yes!  As a matter of fact, I'm visiting my son that lives in Spain next month.  This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now!\nSpeaker B: Oh nice. You must be looking forward to it. He must have told you a lot about her. Do you think you would like her?\nSpeaker A: I think so.  She seems like a very sweet girl and she seems to care deeply about my son, so that's what matters most.  You know, maybe I can stop by and visit you as well, since you live in Europe.  France, Spain, Italy?  Where are you living now?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A's sons have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next. They will be coming for winter break from Europe. \nSpeaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite worrying about them traveling far away. Speaker A's sons play video games and listen to music in their rooms.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker A's sons studying abroad in Spain, which ties into the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A mentions visiting a son in Spain. However, there are a couple of issues:\n\n1. The sentences in the MEMORY do not clearly demonstrate causality or connectivity. For instance, the mention of the sons going to Italy next or coming home for winter break does not directly relate to the context of the upcoming trip to Spain to meet the son's girlfriend.\n2. The information about the sons playing video games and listening to music does not seem relevant or helpful for generating the next response, as it doesn't connect with the ongoing conversation about visiting or the girlfriend.\n3. The MEMORY lacks information about Speaker B, which could be helpful to generate a better response for them in the dialogue context.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides some context but is not very cohesive or directly helpful in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
