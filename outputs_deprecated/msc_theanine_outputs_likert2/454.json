Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue.\nSpeaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is looking for furniture shop to buy furniture, has two dogs, and works near a mall. Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing furniture and home decor choices. This causes Speaker A and Speaker B to plan to meet up to discuss the furniture exchange. Speaker A has devices to keep bugs away and offers to share the product names with Speaker B.\n\nSpeaker A's favorite season is winter and enjoys the country lifestyle. Speaker B plans to grill steaks this weekend and prefers using an old charcoal grill over a gas one. This makes Speaker A look forward to spending quiet evenings outside during the summer, possibly grilling most nights.\n\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both enjoy barbecuing and have a love for pets. They are discussing furniture and home decor choices, leading to a plan to meet up to discuss the furniture exchange. Speaker A invites Speaker B over to enjoy the new furniture and suggests a night with music, food, and company.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'd be happy to help you choose a color scheme! And don't worry, I'll bring along that bug spray to keep those mosquitoes away during our outdoor barbecue.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a reasonable amount of helpful information that supports generating a proper next response for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes relevant details such as:\n\n1. Speaker B's interest in furniture and home decor, which ties back to Speaker B's request for help with picking a color scheme for the living room.\n2. Speaker A's ability to keep bugs away with specific devices, which may be useful given Speaker B's concern about mosquitoes.\n3. Both speakers enjoy barbecuing and are planning to meet up, aligning well with the context of Speaker A playing guitar at a barbecue.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY clearly outlines relevant interests and past interactions, which can help Speaker A in crafting a response that connects to Speaker B's statements. The connections between past events and current plans are generally clear, although some parts of MEMORY are a bit redundant or not entirely necessary, hence the score of 4 instead of a full 5."
