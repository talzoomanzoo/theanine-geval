Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens?\nSpeaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys visiting the zoo and has a cat that recently had a kitten. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend.\n2. Speaker A's sister recently got married, which was exciting for them. Speaker B's girlfriend enjoys pandas and penguins at the zoo and they go to the zoo every few weeks. Speaker B wants to get a kitten from Speaker A's friend. Speaker A prefers cockatoos over kittens as pets.\n3. Speaker B enjoys visiting the zoo and has a cat that recently had a kitten. Speaker B's girlfriend owns a cockatoo named John.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a good plan. It's important to make sure you have enough time to settle in the new kitten.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some background information about Speaker B's interest in adopting a kitten and their general interest in animals, particularly their visits to the zoo. However, it also includes irrelevant information such as Speaker A's sister's marriage and Speaker B's girlfriend's interest in zoo animals. Additionally, while it does reference Speaker B's intent to get a kitten from a friend, it does not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT regarding the timing of the adoption due to Speaker B's vacation plans. The MEMORY lacks coherence and relevancy in helping Speaker A generate a response that follows the current dialogue, as it includes scattered and disconnected information rather than a focused narrative on the relevant issue discussed - the vacation affecting the adoption timing."
