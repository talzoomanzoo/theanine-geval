Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok? \nSpeaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish?\nSpeaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus!\nSpeaker B: Oh that sounds absolutely fabulous. Are you going to get a free dessert, as well?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods. Speaker A owns a restaurant and recently experienced a fire incident but managed to put it out.\n2. Speaker A enjoys the interaction with people at work and the variety of experiences that come with it. Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule.\n3. Speaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit. Speaker A's schedule at the restaurant includes working doubles on Saturdays and 8-hour shifts on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about Speaker A's work situation which is helpful in understanding Speaker A's excitement about the new dish. Points 1 and 3 provide pertinent information about Speaker A's restaurant work, which adds depth to the conversation about meals that Speaker A could try for free. However, the presence of irrelevant or out-of-context information (such as the fire incident and work schedule specifics) takes away from the overall coherence and direct relevancy needed for this context, as they do not directly relate to the conversation about the Chicken parmesan or desserts. Additionally, while points about Speaker A's enjoyment and interaction at work (point 2) are supportive, they are not directly utilized in this dialogue context. Overall, the memory is somewhat helpful but could be more directly tailored to the dialogued context for better coherence and causality."
