Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys watching swimming movies and wants to listen to punk music while swimming and learning programming. \nSpeaker A has known how to swim since the age of 5 and offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming. \nSpeaker B's favorite food is a pizzaburger and is looking forward to eating it in a pool with punk music playing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It connects Speaker B's interest in punk music and swimming with Speaker A's offer to teach swimming. This shows a logical connection and context for their interaction. However, it includes unrelated or extraneous details, such as Speaker B's favorite food being a pizzaburger, which don't contribute directly to the conversation about the meetup or swimming lessons. Therefore, while MEMORY provides some helpful context, it contains elements that don't directly aid the generation of a proper next response."
