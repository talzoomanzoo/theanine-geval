    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for.\nSpeaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for?\nSpeaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\nSpeaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A, a recent high school graduate on a cross-country journey looking for jobs, wants to potentially visit the Columbia Trail and Ken Lockwood Gorge for a camping and hiking trip. They also applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail. As a result, Speaker A plans to leave a hammock by the river for anyone to use at a hidden spot off the main hiking trail, and now has a portable hammock for the hike, asking Speaker B to bring theirs.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great that you found a good gig with your neighbor! Sometimes those side projects can be more lucrative than traditional jobs.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some contextual information about Speaker A's background, such as their recent high school graduation and interest in hiking and camping, which could relate indirectly to their excitement about working at a grocery store near a hiking trail. However, the MEMORY does not directly address or contribute to the current dialogue about Speaker A's new job or Speaker B's work situation. The mention of applying to a grocery store aligns with the conversation but lacks further relevant details that directly connect to Speaker B's situation or add depth to the immediate dialogue about job-related topics. The MEMORY does contain naturally connected sentences about Speaker A's interests and behaviors (e.g., leaving a hammock by the river) but these are not directly relevant to generating a response in this context."
