Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden?\nSpeaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends.\nSpeaker A: That sounds nice! So how is your job going?\nSpeaker B: Always interesting, that's for sure! I have been training to nurse on a new floor, so that'll give me a change of scenery.\nSpeaker A: Does that add a lot of extra work to your plate?\nSpeaker B: At the moment, yes. I'll be in Pediatrics, which has always been my passion. It's a completely different environment than the ER.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a cousin in Sweden and has not visited the country, but wants to travel there with Speaker B. \nSpeaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip, so they are thinking about taking a second part-time job. \nSpeaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to high expenses, but plans to travel there with Speaker A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information about Speaker A's intent to travel to Sweden, and their connection with their cousin, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It also mentions Speaker B's past visits to Sweden, which are relevant as they discuss their experiences in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY incorrectly implies that Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel together, which is not reflected in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, details about saving money and potentially taking a second job are not mentioned in the dialogue, which detracts from its helpfulness in generating a continuation to the conversation. Therefore, while MEMORY provides some relevant information, it also contains inaccuracies and extraneous details affecting its usefulness."
