Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read.\nSpeaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting? \nSpeaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far.\nSpeaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes. \nSpeaker A: why don't you like books like that?\nSpeaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading?\nSpeaker A: Not yet.  I think Netflix is going to make it into a movie soon.  They might finally convince me to pay for a subscription haha.\nSpeaker B: Well if it's any good I know you'll be watching the whole thing.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is tired after spending time with their energetic grandchildren. Speaker A has grandchildren and enjoys watching movies with them. Speaker A has grandchildren and mentions watching them. \nSpeaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch. \nSpeaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix. Speaker B is a parent to a young son who keeps them busy throughout the day. Speaker B has a pre-schooler who enjoys watching movies like Toy Story, Beauty and the Beast, and The Lion King.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "I'll definitely be watching it with my grandkids if it turns out to be as good as the book!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about Speaker A having grandchildren and enjoying movies and books, which slightly relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about taking a break from grandchildren and mentioning Netflix. However, the MEMORY is very repetitive (e.g., mentioning the 8 grandchildren multiple times) and lacks a clear, cohesive narrative or additional relevant information that would aid in generating a more nuanced response in the current conversation. Additionally, it brings up details about Speaker B that are not directly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B being a parent, which doesn't enhance the understanding of the ongoing interaction. Overall, the MEMORY could be structured more naturally with relevant connections to the context for a higher score."
