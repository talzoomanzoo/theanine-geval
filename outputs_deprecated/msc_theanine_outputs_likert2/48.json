Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys being a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs, and also mentions the ups and downs of the profession. Speaker B is concerned about the cost of owning horses, including medical fees and expenses like horse shoes. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories. \nSpeaker B offers to talk about the absence of Speaker A's mother and suggests lying down on their couch, while mentioning the ups and downs of being a therapist. Speaker B lives in the city and is interested in having a horse in the future. \nSpeaker A is involved in horse breeding and taking care of horses, works at a stable, and enjoys being around horses. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B could pay a fee to a ranch to take care of a horse.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Therapy can definitely be helpful in processing past experiences. It's great that you find solace in riding your horses though, there's something special about that bond.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information that can be helpful for Speaker B to continue the conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly regarding interests and experiences related to therapy and horses. It provides insights into Speaker B's profession as a therapist and some aspects of therapy, which aligns with the current topic of conversation. Additionally, the MEMORY includes Speaker B's curiosity about owning horses and the mention of Freudian theories, which could relate to Speaker A's discussion about therapy and unresolved childhood trauma. However, some parts of the MEMORY, such as Speaker B's interest in being a football fan or living in the city, don't directly connect to the ongoing conversation, making it less cohesive and fully relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Thus, while there are relevant snippets, the MEMORY is not entirely structured in an optimally helpful way for generating the next response."
