Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons\nSpeaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use.\nSpeaker B: I am a little scared of needles though. Were your tattoos painful?\nSpeaker A: Most of them were not.  It really depends on where on your body you get them.  Most of mine are on areas that didn't hurt.  The one on my foot and the one behind my ear did hurt a good bit.  Where were you thinking about getting it?\nSpeaker B: I hadn't really thought about it! Maybe upper arm or upper back? But I'm no tattoo expert. And I'd have to get permission from my wife first, LOL\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a total of 5 tattoos and enjoys getting them, with one dedicated to their late father. They plan to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan already tattooed on their chest. Speaker A's favorite tattoo is the one dedicated to their late father, with the phrase \"for you I shall live\". They are working at a coffee shop to save up for their next tattoo.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Upper arm or upper back are great choices for a first tattoo, not too painful. And getting permission from your wife is always a good idea!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information about Speaker A's tattoos, which relates directly to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT discussing tattoos. It connects well with previous conversations, particularly in mentioning the tattoo dedicated to their late father, as Speaker A considers getting a new tattoo for their mom. This shows development and connection between past and current contexts. The mention of Speaker A's tattoo-related motivations (saving money, working at a coffee shop) adds depth and indicates why tattoos are significant to Speaker A. Although memories related to tattoo experiences would further enhance relevancy (like pain experiences or the impact of artwork), the existing MEMORY aids the language model in understanding Speaker A's tattoo journey and decisions."
