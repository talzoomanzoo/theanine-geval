Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. \nSpeaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me.\nSpeaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house. \nSpeaker B: Understandable. Have you ever tried contacting animal control? That's how I got Bandicoot. I was working that day and animal control came by explaining about needing fosters for raccoons. I thought it was weird, so I did it and began to work at the small raccoon cafe that is part of the zoo. I love it. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is interested in animals, specifically raccoons and bearded dragons. \nSpeaker B has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it. \nSpeaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly. \nSpeaker B's garbage has a lock to prevent animals from getting into it, especially during windy weather. \nSpeaker B works at a Raccoon Cafe and takes care of Bandicoot, a raccoon.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I haven't contacted animal control yet, but that's a good idea. Maybe I'll look into it if the aluminum sheeting doesn't do the trick. Thanks for the suggestion!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information that is somewhat helpful and relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes useful background details about Speaker B's experiences with raccoons, such as their belief that raccoons can make good pets, their work at a Raccoon Cafe, and their care for Bandicoot. This contextual information aligns with Speaker B's suggestion of befriending the raccoons and their own experience of working with them. However, the MEMORY could be improved by providing more information about Speaker A's experiences or opinions on raccoons and related issues, as well as more explicit connections between the past interactions of the speakers to facilitate a more coherent and informed response generation in the given context."
