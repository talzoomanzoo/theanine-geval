Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it!\nSpeaker B: I'm glad you liked it. My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to?\nSpeaker A: I recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca. It was super cute and made me want to go visit Italy, but that was too expensive, so instead I booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month. What about you?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys watching Disney movies with her kids, which Speaker A recently experienced when watching the movie 'Luca'. \nSpeaker B, a stay-at-home mom, used to prefer romance and horror movies, but now enjoys watching Disney movies with her kids, who loved 'Luca'. \nSpeaker A and Speaker B both enjoy discussing movies, with Speaker B recommending 'Miracle' to Speaker A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds amazing! I've never been to Hawaii, but I'm sure it'll be a beautiful experience. As for me, just staying busy with the kids and enjoying some family time.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information about Speaker B's interests, particularly their enjoyment of Disney movies with their kids, which aligns with Speaker A's recent viewing of 'Luca'. The information about Speaker B recommending 'Miracle' is directly relevant as it connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A expresses their enjoyment of that film. The mention of Speaker B's previous preference for romance and horror movies somewhat adds depth to Speaker B's character, although it's not immediately relevant to the current dialogue context. Overall, MEMORY is well-connected to the dialogue and aids in generating a natural continuation of the conversation."
