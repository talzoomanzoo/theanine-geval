Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college?\nSpeaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position. \nSpeaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it?\nSpeaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \nSpeaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living.\nSpeaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime?\nSpeaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A, a college student majoring in Humanities and not currently employed, used to work part-time at a supermarket. Now, Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments.\n2. Speaker A, a college student majoring in Humanities and not currently employed, used to work part-time at a supermarket. Now, Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week. This has led to Speaker A scoring well in soccer recently.\n3. Speaker A, who enjoys playing soccer but is not into music, now plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week. This has resulted in Speaker A scoring well in soccer recently.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some background information about Speaker A, such as their college major, previous employment, and interest in soccer. However, the details are somewhat repetitive and not directly connected to the specific conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY mentions Speaker A's role as a striker and their enjoyment of soccer, which could be slightly relevant to the discussion about playing soccer. However, it lacks information on the interaction between Speaker A and Speaker B and any development or causality in their past interactions that would help generate a more contextually rich response. The MEMORY does not significantly contribute to the development of the conversation based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
