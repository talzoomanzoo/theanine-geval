Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed with such a big decision. Teaching can be a rewarding path, especially with your passion for linguistics. Just remember, it's okay to explore different options before committing.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives background on both speakers, detailing their fields of study and career considerations. The information about Speaker B's major and their feeling of limited job opportunities in linguistics ties directly into the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where they express stress about career decisions and consider teaching. Additionally, Speaker A's interest in teaching computer science could relate to advising or discussing teaching as a career option with Speaker B. However, there are some parts, like Speaker A working at a pizza shop, which don't directly relate to the context, preventing a perfect score."
