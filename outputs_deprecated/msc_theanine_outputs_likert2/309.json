Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you.\nSpeaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them\nSpeaker A: IN MY HOME?! A TREE? That was not at all what I was thinking. Do they grow well indoors? I am intrigued. \nSpeaker B: Well if you want to make it like a proper garden experience then I would suggest going all in, and go for the best most authentic looking items you could get \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is interested in space exploration and plant science, expressing concerns about the fuels used for space travel. This resonates with Speaker A's interest in nuclear energy and space exploration, mentioning fusion experiments. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing. \nSpeaker B is focused on developing renewable energy sources for their inventions, shifting away from working on a teleportation machine and a time machine. This aligns with Speaker B's plans to combat weight gain from spending time at the computer by working in the garden more. Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I see what you mean. Creating a full garden experience does sound appealing. I'll definitely consider that approach. Thank you for the advice!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful context for generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is not very specific or directly connected to the current conversation. It includes information about Speaker B's knowledge and interest in gardening and plant science, which could help inform Speaker A's quest for gardening suggestions. However, the MEMORY contains unrelated topics such as space exploration, fuels for space travel, teleportation, and time machines, which do not contribute to the garden conversation. Also, there is no direct causality or development of actions leading to Speaker A's current interest in planting at home. Overall, the MEMORY does provide some relevant insights but lacks coherence and focus on the dialogue topic."
