Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "raw_prediction": "That's awesome, crab legs and shrimp are delicious! I think certain foods can definitely be healing, like bone broth and turmeric. Have you ever tried incorporating those into your diet?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some background information about Speaker A and Speaker B, such as Speaker B working as a bartender and enjoying local holidays, and Speaker A enjoying a Brazilian steakhouse. However, it does not contain information directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where the conversation is about Black Widow, sushi, and food preferences related to healing. While there is a mention of Speaker B expressing interest in healing methods, it is only tangentially related to the ongoing conversation without providing more depth on the topic. The MEMORY lacks specific connections or developments that align directly with the details of the current dialogue, which limits its helpfulness in generating a continuous response."
