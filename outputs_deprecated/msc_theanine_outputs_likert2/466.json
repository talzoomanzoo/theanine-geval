Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it?\nSpeaker B: Yes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see. \nSpeaker A: I definitely will, this sounds like such an amazing trip. How long has it been since you've been there yourself?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A's mother being a pediatrician causes Speaker A to have kids and be familiar with Greek mythology, which in turn causes Speaker B to plan a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five. \nSpeaker B having three kids makes Speaker A have kids and be familiar with Greek mythology, leading Speaker B and their kids to be excited about their upcoming trip to Greece. \nSpeaker B being excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loving Athena, whom they consider a perfect goddess for a librarian, is the same topic as Speaker B's enjoyment of being outside and reading Star Wars novels, which in turn makes Speaker B plan a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some potentially relevant background information, such as Speaker B's excitement about Greece and their connection to Greek mythology, which could be helpful in creating responses related to the excitement and interest in Greek culture. However, the connections made in the MEMORY—linking Speaker A's mother's profession to Speaker B's travel plans, or Speaker B's love for Athena to them planning a trip—appear to be forced and lack clear causality or relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on the Acropolis visit. Additionally, the fact that Speaker B is planning a trip contradicts the context where it is implied Speaker B has already visited. Overall, the MEMORY does not naturally connect past interactions or build clear causality relevant to the immediate conversation, thus providing only limited help in responding to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
