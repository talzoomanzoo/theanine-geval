Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet? \nSpeaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name?\nSpeaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \nSpeaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along!\nSpeaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A, a country girl who loves animals and is a lacto-ovo vegetarian, has a pet named Tasha who speaks Mandarin. Speaker B, who lives in the city they grew up in and loves animals, has two sick kitties and recently received a rescue kitten. Speaker A, with a pet parrot named Tasha and red hair that makes them stand out, is interested in adopting a rescue kitten despite having a parrot.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Tasha sounds like quite the character. It would definitely be interesting to see how she interacts with the new kittens!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The memory provides helpful information for Speaker B to generate a response. It includes details that are relevant to the dialogue context, such as Speaker A's interest in adopting a rescue kitten and the fact that she has a pet parrot named Tasha. This information connects well with the dialogue context where the topic of adopting kittens is being discussed. Additionally, the memory mentions that Tasha, the parrot, speaks Mandarin, which while not directly connected to the current dialogue context, adds depth to the character background. The memory also notes that Speaker B loves animals and has recently received a rescue kitten, which is pertinent information given the current discussion about naming and adopting kittens. Overall, the memory sentences are naturally connected and enhance the understanding of the dialogue context."
