Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you.\nSpeaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them\nSpeaker A: IN MY HOME?! A TREE? That was not at all what I was thinking. Do they grow well indoors? I am intrigued. \nSpeaker B: Well if you want to make it like a proper garden experience then I would suggest going all in, and go for the best most authentic looking items you could get \nSpeaker A: Wow! Ok! This is sounding like a bigger undertaking! Should I embrace bugs in the home if they help the plants or am I getting wild?\nSpeaker B: Well from my experince bugs do the complete opposite and don't help at all, so avoid that at all costs! Fertilizers are the way to go to help with growth.\nSpeaker A: Oh man. I have lots to learn. What is the lifespan of a plum tree?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is focused on developing renewable energy sources for their inventions. Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more. Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some potentially helpful information about Speaker B that could be relevant to generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it mentions Speaker B's knowledge about plants and gardening and their plans to work in the garden more, which aligns with the ongoing conversation about creating a garden indoors. However, the MEMORY also includes details about renewable energy sources and weight gain, which do not directly relate to the current dialogue about indoor gardening. The connection and relevance between the MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT are not as clearly demonstrated due to these unrelated points, but the useful parts could help guide Speaker B's responses related to gardening knowledge."
