Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet? \nSpeaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name?\nSpeaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \nSpeaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along!\nSpeaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them.\nSpeaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me!\nSpeaker A: Hahaha. Yes I agree its too hot to get a long hike in. I've been on some short ones, but the bugs eat me alive. I like to hike in the fall when the bugs are dying off and its a little cooler.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a pet parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten. \nSpeaker A is a country girl who loves animals and is considering adopting a rescue kitten. \nSpeaker B lives in the city they grew up in, loves animals, and has a cat that recently had a kitten.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I totally get that! Fall hikes are the best, no bugs and cooler temperatures. It's my favorite time of year to hit the trails too.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information that can aid Speaker B in generating a natural and contextually appropriate response in the dialogue. It mentions Speaker A's pet parrot, Tasha, and their interest in adopting a rescue kitten, which ties into the discussion about kittens and potential pet dynamics mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It also highlights Speaker B's connection to animals and recent experience with their cat having kittens, which reinforces their ability to engage in the conversation about pet names and adoption. Although the MEMORY sentences are not entirely sequential or causally connected, they provide meaningful context that can guide the continuation of the dialogue. The MEMORY could be improved with more direct connections between sentences, but overall, it is helpful."
