Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing?\nSpeaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B recently divorced their wife and loves to scuba dive in Hawaii when not working. Speaker A does not have any pets and expresses an interest in scuba diving. Speaker A is interested in scuba diving and neuroscience, with experience in a research lab. Speaker B has an interest in diving and is planning to take neuroscience classes using the GI Bill.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! Low maintenance pets are definitely a plus.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains information about Speaker B's personal background and interests, particularly in scuba diving and upcoming plans to take neuroscience classes. While this information might be somewhat relevant in a broader conversational context, it does not directly pertain to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about pet snakes, specifically Hensel and Gretel. The MEMORY lacks any mention of pets or related topics, making it not particularly helpful for generating a relevant response to the conversation at hand. The lack of direct connection between the MEMORY content and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is why the score is relatively low. However, the information is structured coherently, so it does not receive the lowest possible score."
