Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know. \nSpeaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like.\nSpeaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too.\nSpeaker B: Nice! Is anyone coming with you?\nSpeaker A: Just my doggy Drunky.  You never know,  I might meet a nice lady out there. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys Mexican food and drinks, and plays music for fun. Speaker A also enjoys going to bars and loves the ladies. Both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n\nSpeaker A owns a Subaru Legacy and mentions having a baby on the way. Speaker B is not going out drinking much due to their wife's pregnancy. Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day. Speaker A is not sure if they will ever settle down with a partner and have kids.\n\nSpeaker B is a mechanic who enjoys working on cars. Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it could be more directly aligned with the conversation. For instance, the MEMORY mentions both speakers' enjoyment of bluegrass music, which is relevant to the current context about the Bluegrass show. It also notes Speaker B's wife's pregnancy and considerations around attending festivals, which connects to the context of finding a hospitable and comfortable arrangement for her. However, other parts of the MEMORY, such as Speaker A's tendencies around music, drinks, and lifestyle, are not as immediately relevant to this specific DIALOGUE CONTEXT about the logistics of attending a festival and accommodations. The MEMORY could benefit from more direct sentences about past interactions between Speaker A and B concerning the festival plans or related logistics to improve clarity and direct relevance."
