Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me?\nSpeaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week?\nSpeaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day\nSpeaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through\nSpeaker A: Actually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to it. Do you think I will need to rent a car when I'm there, or is it possible to walk and bike in the summer? I always picture huge amounts of snow but I'm not sure if it's like that all year round.\nSpeaker A: I would definitely recommend looking for a rental car to have on hand. There is a town within walking distance from me, but it can be dangerous to walk with the wolves and elk around, especially at night.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A suggests going on hikes in Alaska to see wildlife and mentions glaciers as a potential attraction, which Speaker B is interested in during their visit. Speaker A also mentioned the wildlife, including elk and wolves, which Speaker B is interested in by asking about a wolf petting zoo.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's good to know, I'll look into renting a car then. I wouldn't want to risk running into any wildlife on foot at night.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response. It highlights Speaker A's inclination to suggest outdoor activities and wildlife attractions in Alaska, which is relevant when discussing the necessity of renting a car versus walking or biking. The mention of wildlife, including elk and wolves, directly connects to the dialogue about local dangers. However, the idea of a \"wolf petting zoo\" seems disconnected from the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, some information about hikes and glaciers was not directly addressed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which slightly affects the natural flow and integration necessary for a highly relevant and helpful memory."
