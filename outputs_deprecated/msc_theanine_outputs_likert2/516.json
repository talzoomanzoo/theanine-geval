Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well?\nSpeaker B: The older one seems to like it while the youngest cannot be bothered. Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon?\nSpeaker A: Yes!  As a matter of fact, I'm visiting my son that lives in Spain next month.  This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now!\nSpeaker B: Oh nice. You must be looking forward to it. He must have told you a lot about her. Do you think you would like her?\nSpeaker A: I think so.  She seems like a very sweet girl and she seems to care deeply about my son, so that's what matters most.  You know, maybe I can stop by and visit you as well, since you live in Europe.  France, Spain, Italy?  Where are you living now?\nSpeaker B: Bless her, that's good to hear. That would be great! I live in Portugal. It's not too far from Spain. We can always arrange something. How long would you be there for?\nSpeaker A: I'm planning to stay in Spain for three weeks.  Since you live in Portugal, I'd love to stop by for a visit if you're free this coming month.  I've always wanted to visit Lisbon.  It has the world's longest bridge!\nSpeaker B: That'a great idea. We have a holiday house just outside of Lisbon. You are welcome to lodge with us.\nSpeaker A: Sounds great!  I'm already very excited about my trip to Spain, and now I get to visit you in Lisbon!  I need to brush up on my Spanish and also start studying Portuguese.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys different cuisines like Mexican, Italian, and Chinese. This passion for food is shared with Speaker A's sons, who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next. One of Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe. Speaker A has multiple sons, at least one of them is in a relationship with a Spanish girlfriend. Additionally, Speaker A's sons are involved in different career paths, with one studying to be a chef in college.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "That sounds wonderful! I'll be glad to show you around Lisbon and help you practice some Portuguese.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information that could be used to generate a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It confirms that Speaker A has multiple sons and indicates that one son is in a relationship with a Spanish girlfriend, which aligns with the ongoing conversation about visiting Spain and meeting the girlfriend. Additionally, the fact that Speaker A has sons studying in Europe is relevant to the discussion of Speaker A's travel plans. However, other information, such as Speaker A's love for different cuisines and his son's career in culinary arts, is not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about visiting Europe and doesn't enhance the specific conversation at hand. The memory doesn't fully explore the development of previous interactions or clearly highlight any causality between events, making it moderately helpful but not complete or perfectly aligned to the context."
