Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it!\nSpeaker B: I'm glad you liked it. My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys watching movies with her kids. This includes romance and horror movies, which their kids do not enjoy. Speaker B also finds Disney movies good, especially as a small escape into a new world. Speaker B's husband, on the other hand, enjoys Disney sports movies like 'Miracle'.\nSpeaker B is a stay-at-home mom, which causes her kids to enjoy watching Disney movies, something that Speaker B also finds good. The movie 'Miracle' is about the 1980 U.S. hockey team.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful information that can help Speaker A generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It informs that Speaker B enjoys watching movies, especially Disney, with her kids, and that her husband particularly likes Disney sports movies like 'Miracle.' This background supports the context of the movie recommendation and enjoyment. The MEMORY also contextualizes the movie 'Miracle' by noting it's about the 1980 U.S. hockey team, which is useful should Speaker A wish to continue discussing the movie in detail. However, some parts of MEMORY like describing Speaker B as a stay-at-home mom feel slightly less connected to the conversation and are not as pertinent for the next response. This slightly reduces the score from a perfect 5."
