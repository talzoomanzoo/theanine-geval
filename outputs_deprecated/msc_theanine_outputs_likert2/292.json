Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \nSpeaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with?\nSpeaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point.\nSpeaker A: Yes, it contains eggs.  I think you would do well with the fried rice. It's best to cook the rice the day before.  \nSpeaker B: I didn't know that. Why cook the rice beforehand? Is it better to age rice or something?\nSpeaker A: The rice needs to be cool before adding to the pan.  Are you able to take a passenger along in you truck?\nSpeaker B: Oh! That makes since. I didn't realize that the temperature made a difference when frying rice. As for the truck, Yes I can. But, depending on what company I'm working for at the time, they often set restrictions on passengers.\nSpeaker A: The rice tends to stick together if it's warm.  I would like to ride along with you sometime when you're able.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, who does not cook but enjoys listening to country music and drives trucks for a living, has a husband who is a great cook. Speaker B is not skilled in cooking, but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker. \nSpeaker B, who does not cook but enjoys listening to country music and drives trucks for a living, also mentions having a farm with animals like chickens, ducks, pigs, goats, and growing crops like corn, strawberries, and pumpkins. Speaker A, who owns a farm and enjoys cooking and baking, is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken. \nSpeaker B, who lives in a rural area with a farm and can relate to cooking, reacts to Speaker A who bakes muffins and bread but is conscious of their impact on their weight. Speaker A is interested in running a business with their cooking skills and recommends the pressure cooker for its efficiency and ease of use, suggesting it to Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "That would be great! I'll let you know when I have a passenger seat available.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that can be helpful for generating a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes Speaker B's limited cooking skills and interest in learning, which ties into the dialogue about trying beginner recipes. The mention of country music and truck driving adds context to the conversation about taking a passenger in the truck. The fact that Speaker B has a husband who is a great cook provides insight into their motivation to learn cooking. The details about the farm and growing their own eggs are directly relevant to the discussion about using home-grown eggs in the shrimp fried rice recipe. While the MEMORY includes some extraneous details about Speaker A baking muffins and being conscious of weight, which are not immediately connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, the overall information is largely applicable and provides a basis for the interaction."
