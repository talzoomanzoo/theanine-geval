Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens?\nSpeaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month\nSpeaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.  Where are you going on vacation?\nSpeaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there!\nSpeaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo?\nSpeaker B: Their zoo is pretty good! It's always crowded, of course, but they have pandas so I'm happy. I would say it's bigger than the DC zoo, but I like that the DC zoo has fewer people.\nSpeaker A: That sounds awesome.  I haven't been to the zoo in so long.  I wish I could go.\nSpeaker B: You should go with your sister! she can bring her dog. They probably have all kinds of exotic birds...\nSpeaker A: That's a great idea!  I'm not sure how good her dog would do around other animals though.  She always barks like crazy whenever she sees any kind of animal.\nSpeaker B: Oh, that's a good point. Maybe keep her away from the small rodent house and reptiles, eh?\nSpeaker A: For sure.  Hopefully she'll be more curious than aggressive.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B discuss hobbies and interests, with Speaker A enjoying gardening and reading, and Speaker B enjoying visiting the zoo. Speaker B's girlfriend enjoys pandas and penguins at the zoo, and they go to the zoo every few weeks. Speaker A has been to the zoo before and enjoys seeing exotic birds. Speaker A prefers cockatoos over kittens as pets.\n\nSpeaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo. Speaker A enjoys seeing pandas and penguins at the zoo and goes with their sister. Speaker A's sister is a dog person with a yellow lab. Speaker B is open to being a cool uncle to his sister's future children but does not want kids of his own. Speaker B's girlfriend owns a cockatoo named John.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "Hopefully she'll be more curious than aggressive. Maybe she'll even make some new furry friends at the zoo!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY does provide some helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly regarding Speaker B's enthusiasm for zoos and pandas, as well as some details about Speaker A's sister owning a dog. However, the MEMORY contains several disjointed and unrelated pieces of information that do not directly tie into the current context, which revolves around a vacation to San Diego and plans regarding a kitten. Some details, such as preferences for cockatoos over kittens and Speaker B’s girlfriend’s specific interests, seem irrelevant or disconnected from the current dialogue and do not contribute to the continuation or predictability of the conversation in a meaningful way. Hence, while helpful in parts, the MEMORY could better focus on the direct interests and current plans being discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
