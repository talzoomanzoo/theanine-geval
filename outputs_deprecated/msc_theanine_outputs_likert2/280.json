Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her?\nSpeaker B: Hi there, hope you are wlll and managing to save up for your Italy trip?  Thank for asking about the Greek mythology study, we are doing very well. It helps because i am so passionate about it and hope to get to the Greek islands soon\nSpeaker A: Yes I have been saving up for another trip to Italy! I can't wait. It's planned for next Spring. Do you have any plans to go back to Italy in the future?\nSpeaker B: I would love to get back to Italy but need to save up and the hopeful priority is to Greece this year.  You have friends in Europe are you in contact to see what plans you can make?\nSpeaker A: Yes I've been talking to them quite a bit so they know what's going on. I'll be staying with some of them while I'm over there. I have never been to Greece....I'd like to go though. Maybe I'll add it to my itinerary! Maybe we could plan to be in Greece at the same time?!\nSpeaker B: That would be so good.  There is so much history and the roman statues i take my daughter to see in the museums and through our local resources is fab.  She is building up the passion which is lovely to see.  Have you still got your hair blue or has it grown out now?\nSpeaker A: That's awesome! Maybe you can teach me a little about all the mythology. I think I've never liked it before only because I didn't understand it. My hair is back to being its natural brown - lol I'm being boring for the moment.\nSpeaker B: Never boring you will keep styling it all sorts of interesting styles im sure.  Yes i would be lovely to be your guide for the day out in Greece.  Bring some decent walking boots and some sun cream, its a different heat out there but your tan is probably topped up with going to the beach each day.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has been to Italy in the past and enjoyed the food there, while Speaker A is fascinated by the architecture of Italy and enjoys studying history, especially through reading and watching documentaries.\n\nSpeaker A is planning for a spring break trip and recently bought a dress for Easter, while Speaker B does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology. Speaker A is planning to travel to Italy alone for Spring Break and has friends from Europe meeting up with them.\n\nSpeaker B suggests California as a destination for Speaker A's trip, mentioning that they have tried surfing before but are not very good at it. Additionally, Speaker B expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology, which aligns with Speaker A's fascination with the architecture of Italy and passion for studying history.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'll definitely pack my walking boots and sun cream for Greece! It would be amazing to have you as my guide. I can't wait to explore the history and mythology together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's interest in Greece and Greek mythology, which aligns with the ongoing conversation about Greece and Greek mythology. It also mentions Speaker A's interest in Italy and plans for a spring break trip, which connects with the conversation about saving up for a trip to Italy.\n\nHowever, there are parts of the MEMORY that are less relevant or necessary for generating a response based on the current dialogue. For example, the suggestion of California as a trip destination and Speaker B's surfing experience are not related to the topics being discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the mention of Speaker A buying a dress for Easter doesn't have a direct connection to the conversation.\n\nWhile some causality and relevancy are demonstrated, not all sentences in the MEMORY provide helpful or directly relevant information for the next response, leading me to give a score of 3."
