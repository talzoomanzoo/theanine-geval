Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies!\nSpeaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?  \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A, an inventor working on a time machine, enjoys teleporting worldwide and loves animals, especially puppies. They frequently visit shelters in different cities to care for dogs and cats, particularly excited about new puppies. \nSpeaker B, a 26-year-old workaholic unsure about their career, is interested in volunteering and leans towards cats, especially kittens, over dogs. They don't have strong opinions on puppies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker A's love for puppies and their excitement about new ones at shelters, which aligns with Speaker A's comment about the cuteness of the new cat not surpassing that of puppies. This background underlines their preference for puppies and could help in formulating a response that contrasts Speaker B's inquiry about the differences between kittens and puppies. \n\nAdditionally, Speaker B's profile of being more inclined towards cats, particularly kittens, offers context for their question, as it suggests why they might not share Speaker A's enthusiasm for puppies. However, the connection between Speaker A’s passion for puppies and their inventor background, as well as Speaker B’s career uncertainty, does not directly contribute to the current dialogue. The MEMORY lacks explicit causal linkages or detailed interactions between the speakers that are directly relevant, thus limiting its ability to enrich the conversation."
