Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships!\nSpeaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!   I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field?\nSpeaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate?\nSpeaker B: I have another year- so this year is really important I get internships and start making connections in the field.   I love going to the beach too.  What happened with your knees that now cause you so much pain?\nSpeaker A: I think age has really been my knees downfall. I also used to hike a lot and I put a lot of pressure on my legs. That is great that you only have a year. Maybe when you graduate you can come hang out on the beach with me. I can't surf but I would love to watch you.\nSpeaker B: That would be fun!  I like collecting shells too so we could do that as well.  I have a small collection of ones I have from around the world.  The farthest away was from Greece.  Have you traveled a lot?\nSpeaker A: I have. I love Europe. I have been to many countries there but I have not gone to Greece yet. I would love to. The scenery and architecture is amazing. Have you gotten to visit other European countries?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is studying sports medicine and plays soccer, looking to join their college team in the future. Speaker B's professors have been supportive in writing letters for an internship application. Speaker A is offering advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field.\n\nSpeaker B has been going to the beach a lot and is learning to surf from friends in Jersey. Speaker A used to surf and is trying to get back into it. Speaker A suggests that surfing could be a way for Speaker B to make connections in the medical field.\n\nSpeaker A enjoys hiking along the coast and collecting shells, mentioning that their knees can't handle much else.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I haven't made it to Europe yet, but I hope to travel there someday. It's great to hear about your experiences there.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information but is not fully helpful for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. There are connections between the MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXTâ€”such as Speaker B's interest in sports medicine and the beach, and Speaker A's mention of providing internship information and experiences related to surfing and shells. However, MEMORY contains information that is not clearly tied to the immediate context or has a few inaccuracies. For example, it mentions Speaker A used to surf, but in the context, Speaker A only expressed a willingness to watch Speaker B surf. Additionally, the suggestion that surfing could be a way for Speaker B to make connections in the medical field seems off-track. The overall structure lacks cohesive links or causality, making it only moderately useful for the language model to craft a response that fits the ongoing conversation dynamically and contextually."
