Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on!\nSpeaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar.\nSpeaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general?\nSpeaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts.\nSpeaker A: How's learning to bake going in general, especially now that you're off desserts?\nSpeaker B: I one of those people how have to fail a couple of times before I get the hang of it, but I'm getting there.  Have you and the kids had any chance to go skiing lately?\nSpeaker A: Water skiing? Yes, last weekend. It was so much fun!\nSpeaker B: (sorry my typing sucks)  That's awesome. I wish had access to a boat, but who knows, maybe one day. \nSpeaker A: Boating is so fun. You could go wakeboarding more often if you had your own boat. And no more boat rental fees or hassle.\nSpeaker B: I actually saw a drone the at will pull you in the water. It's the craziest thing.  \nSpeaker A: That must be a huge drone!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is excited to buy their first new car and wants to try water skiing next. They are looking forward to joining Speaker A's family for a water skiing trip and learning from Speaker A's kids.\nSpeaker B values following their passions for snowboarding and music. Speaker A loves boating and water sports, mentioning that they are better at water skiing than wakeboarding. Speaker B is considering living in a houseboat when they are old and retired.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I bet using a drone for water sports would be an exhilarating experience!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's interest in water skiing and their mention of valuing passions like snowboarding and music. This could be relevant to the conversation about skiing and boating. Additionally, Speaker A's interest in boating and water sports is mentioned, which connects to their dialogue about access to boats and wakeboarding.\n\nHowever, MEMORY includes some extraneous information such as Speaker B's excitement to buy a new car and considering living in a houseboat when retired, which doesn't clearly connect or cause relevance to the current conversation within the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Furthermore, the context of wanting to join Speaker A's family for a water skiing trip isn't directly mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making the MEMORY less naturally connected or causally linked."
