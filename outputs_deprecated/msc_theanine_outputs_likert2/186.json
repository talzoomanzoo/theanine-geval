Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make?\nSpeaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A wakes up early in the morning to catch waves, while Speaker B likes to eat huge steaks after snowboarding. Speaker A prefers surfing and grew up in a beach town, but now likes cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally. Speaker A enjoys cooking and finds it helpful for stress relief. Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe, which always reminds them of the good old days. Speaker B's grandmother was the matriarch of the family, known for cooking large meals for family gatherings.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a valuable backdrop that enriches the dialogue context. It contains several relevant pieces of information that align with the discussion about cooking and preferences for spicy foods. Notably, it emphasizes Speaker B's connection to the garlic chicken recipe as a cherished family tradition, reflecting why it's one of their favorites. Additionally, it highlights both speakers' interests in cooking – Speaker A occasionally likes cooking and finds it stress-relieving, while Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones – offering insights into their personalities and potential talking points in their conversation about food. \n\nWhile aspects like Speaker A's surfing and beach-town upbringing and Speaker B's grandmother's role as a family matriarch add color, they might not directly relate to the spicy food conversation, slightly reducing the focus. However, the coherence and relevance of memories involving cooking are well-connected, clearly providing a causal and relevant context that enhances the dialogue development. The memories effectively establish and explain the underlying connections between the speakers' culinary interests and preferences."
