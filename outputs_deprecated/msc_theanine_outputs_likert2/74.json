Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play? \nSpeaker B: I don't know play instrument.

    "raw_prediction": "I would definitely love to learn to surf if I had more time. It sounds like an amazing experience.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker B's interest and considerations around surfing, which is in line with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where surfing is mentioned. It also touches on Speaker B's interest in fishing and the ocean, which provides additional background context. However, there is some redundancy and a lack of clear causality or relevance between these points and the exact moment of dialogue to be generated. The information about Speaker A's upbringing in California and love of surfing somewhat relates to the discussion, but it could be more directly connected to the ongoing conversation in the context. Overall, MEMORY offers helpful context but could be more directly aligned with the dialogue flow and Speaker B's specific immediate interests."
