Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is working on becoming an Eagle Scout and volunteers at a research lab. Speaker A is scared of sharks but finds the idea of going into a steel cage with them interesting. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies. Speaker A does not have any pets and expresses an interest in scuba diving. \n\nSpeaker B is a veteran and knows of Eagle Scout projects for veterans, including one that helps dispose of American flags correctly. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies. \n\nSpeaker A is working on becoming an Eagle Scout and volunteers at a research lab. Speaker A does not have any pets and expresses an interest in scuba diving. Speaker B has an interest in diving and is planning to take neuroscience classes using the GI Bill.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information about both Speaker A and Speaker B; however, it contains a lot of repetitive information and some irrelevant details which dilute its helpfulness. For instance, the facts about Speaker A wanting to become an Eagle Scout, volunteering at a research lab, and not having any pets are repeated several times. Similarly, details about Speaker B being a veteran and having two pet snakes are repeated. \n\nWhile there are relevant details, such as Speaker B having pet snakes, which directly connects to the dialogue context regarding how Speaker B's snakes are doing, much of the MEMORY doesn't build a seamless and relevant connection to the current context, missing an opportunity to provide more insight into past interactions directly related to the topic of Speaker B's pet snakes. Furthermore, memory connections like Speaker A's amusement about Speaker B's preference for animals over humans or the mutual interest in diving are not directly relevant to the question about Speaker B's snakes. Thus, the content lacks coherence in a way that directly helps the AI generate a focused next response to the dialogue context."
