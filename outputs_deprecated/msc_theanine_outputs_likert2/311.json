Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you.\nSpeaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them\nSpeaker A: IN MY HOME?! A TREE? That was not at all what I was thinking. Do they grow well indoors? I am intrigued. \nSpeaker B: Well if you want to make it like a proper garden experience then I would suggest going all in, and go for the best most authentic looking items you could get \nSpeaker A: Wow! Ok! This is sounding like a bigger undertaking! Should I embrace bugs in the home if they help the plants or am I getting wild?\nSpeaker B: Well from my experince bugs do the complete opposite and don't help at all, so avoid that at all costs! Fertilizers are the way to go to help with growth.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is an inventor working on a teleportation machine and a time machine. This has led Speaker B to focus on developing renewable energy sources for their inventions. Speaker A, on the other hand, is interested in nuclear energy and space exploration, mentioning fusion experiments, which causes Speaker A to struggle with gardening but find the idea of space plants intriguing.\n\nSpeaker B is an inventor working on a teleportation machine and a time machine, but now Speaker B is working on a teleportation machine that is currently small and requires substantial energy sources. Speaker B is also interested in space exploration and plant science, expressing concerns about the fuels used for space travel. Additionally, Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden.\n\nSpeaker B is an inventor working on a teleportation machine and a time machine, leading Speaker B to focus on developing renewable energy sources for their inventions. Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more, which causes Speaker A to struggle with gardening but find the idea of space plants intriguing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "Thank you for the advice on fertilizers! I'll definitely look into that for my indoor garden project.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: While the MEMORY provides some insight into the interests and expertise of Speaker B, particularly in plants and gardening, the connections to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT are not clear or direct. The information about Speaker B being an inventor and working on projects like teleportation and renewable energy sources does not directly relate to the discussion about indoor gardening and plant suggestions. Additionally, the MEMORY is somewhat repetitive and lacks a coherent and natural progression of ideas that would help inform Speaker A's next response in the context of the ongoing conversation about home gardening. It provides some background but is not highly relevant or essential to the immediate dialogue exchange."
