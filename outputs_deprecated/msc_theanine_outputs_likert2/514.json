Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well?\nSpeaker B: The older one seems to like it while the youngest cannot be bothered. Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon?\nSpeaker A: Yes!  As a matter of fact, I'm visiting my son that lives in Spain next month.  This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now!\nSpeaker B: Oh nice. You must be looking forward to it. He must have told you a lot about her. Do you think you would like her?\nSpeaker A: I think so.  She seems like a very sweet girl and she seems to care deeply about my son, so that's what matters most.  You know, maybe I can stop by and visit you as well, since you live in Europe.  France, Spain, Italy?  Where are you living now?\nSpeaker B: Bless her, that's good to hear. That would be great! I live in Portugal. It's not too far from Spain. We can always arrange something. How long would you be there for?\nSpeaker A: I'm planning to stay in Spain for three weeks.  Since you live in Portugal, I'd love to stop by for a visit if you're free this coming month.  I've always wanted to visit Lisbon.  It has the world's longest bridge!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A's sons have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next. Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe.\nSpeaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite worrying about them traveling far away. Speaker B is trying to encourage one of their sons to get into programming or writing, but the son is more interested in gaming with friends. Speaker A's sons play video games and listen to music in their rooms.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds wonderful! I'd be happy to show you around Lisbon when you visit. Just let me know when you're free, and we can plan something.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about Speaker A's sons studying abroad in Spain and traveling to Italy next, which ties to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A is visiting their son in Spain. This connection is somewhat relevant but not directly helpful for the immediate dialogue about visiting Speaker B in Portugal. Additionally, Speaker B's mention of encouraging their son into programming is irrelevant to the current conversation between the speakers. The connection between gaming, music interests, and the discussion about meeting in Europe is also unclear. Overall, the MEMORY contains loosely relevant details but lacks strong causality or connection to aid in generating the next response."
