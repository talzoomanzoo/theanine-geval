    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week?\nSpeaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you?\nSpeaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions?\nSpeaker B: Unfortunately I mainly play games similar to RE. I don't know why I like them so much. I remember when I was little my brother play Doom and it gave me nightmares for a week. What genre of games you like?\nSpeaker A: I like all kinds of games. I like party, fighting, RPGs, shooters, action, adventure, and puzzle games. I enjoy playing Jurassic Park: World but I'd like to find another game to play. The storm means I'll be inside for a bit, so I think I'll curl up with some pizza and just zone out. Do you like to do anything else besides game when it's rainy?\nSpeaker B: Well, I might help around the house with cleaning or laundry, but not that much. Mostly gaming. If I feel I sat too long, I'll switch to Nintendo Switch's Ring Fit Adventure to get my body moving a bit. Do yo know that game?\nSpeaker A: I've heard of it. I think I need to get some exercise, so that might be a good idea. I'd like to stay in shape as much as I can. I guess games are the best way to do that! That's a good suggestion. How about you? Do you only like games like RE? What other genres do you like?\nSpeaker B: I like fighting too, but not RPG types. I tried racing games before, but clearly not good at it so I'm not enjoying them that much. \nSpeaker A: Maybe when you get the chance, we should play an online game together. I'm not a competitive person. I mainly play games for fun and I don't care if I win or lose. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: Sure! Do you have any suggestion for the game? I also not that competitive, which probably is the reason why I don't enjoy RPG types that much with all their groups and clans and ranks. I always thought RPG players are all these serious gamers.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both enjoy playing video games in their free time. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\nSpeaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World.

    "raw_prediction": "How about we try a co-op puzzle or adventure game? It's a good mix of fun and teamwork without the pressure of competition. Plus, it could be a nice change of pace from our usual games.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains some relevant information, such as Speaker A's hesitation to play Resident Evil and their enjoyment of Jurassic Park: World. However, the information about planning to play games together is repetitive and does not accurately reflect the conversation, as the plan to play games together is only a suggestion, not a confirmed plan. Additionally, the MEMORY is missing crucial details that are part of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A's interest in a variety of video game genres, and Speaker B's preference for fighting games and their use of the Nintendo Switch's Ring Fit Adventure. The lack of these details means the MEMORY does not adequately capture the full scope of the exchange, limiting its helpfulness in generating a relevant response. Furthermore, sentences could be better connected to reflect the causality or development of the conversation."
