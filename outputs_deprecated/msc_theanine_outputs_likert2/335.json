Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it! Thank you for the recommendation.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys watching suspense films, action, SF, horror, westerns, drama, and occasional good comedy. Speaker B is knowledgeable about movies and provides recommendations based on Speaker A's preferences. Speaker A is interested in watching movies, mentioned Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman. Speaker A relies on Speaker B for movie suggestions, mentioning a preference for comedies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad you enjoyed it! Since you liked Pulp Fiction, you might also enjoy Reservoir Dogs.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful context as it outlines Speaker B's knowledge and enjoyment of various movie genres. It also highlights Speaker A's interest in movies and their reliance on Speaker B for recommendations, which directly relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A expresses gratitude for a movie suggestion (Pulp Fiction). The connection and relevancy between the MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT are well-established, as the information about Speaker B's expertise and Speaker A's interests naturally informs their conversation about movie recommendations. However, more specific information about their previous discussions or interactions could further enhance the helpfulness."
