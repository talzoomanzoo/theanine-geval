Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me?\nSpeaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week?\nSpeaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day\nSpeaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through\nSpeaker A: Actually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to it. Do you think I will need to rent a car when I'm there, or is it possible to walk and bike in the summer? I always picture huge amounts of snow but I'm not sure if it's like that all year round.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A invited Speaker B to visit and mentioned looking into flights, causing Speaker A to plan to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit.\n\nSpeaker A invited Speaker B to visit and mentioned looking into flights, causing Speaker B to plan to visit Speaker A and be interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n\nSpeaker B is interested in visiting Alaska and mentions getting blackout curtains due to the midnight sun, causing Speaker B to find flights that work for their schedule and price and will be visiting Speaker A in a couple of weeks, which in turn causes Speaker A to be excited about the trip.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "You might not need to rent a car, it's definitely possible to walk and bike around here in the summer. The snow melts pretty quickly once summer hits.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information but with discrepancies and extraneous details that are not highly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY captures the plan for Speaker B's visit and the potential activities, such as attending folk concerts, which is relevant to the discussion in the context. However, it introduces unrelated activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour which were not mentioned in the context and could confuse the generation of a suitable next response. Additionally, it inaccurately states Speaker A mentioned looking into flights, while it was Speaker B who was monitoring the airfare. Despite some inaccuracies, MEMORY captures the essence of Speaker B planning a visit and their interest in concert activities, making it moderately useful. For a higher score, MEMORY needs more precise alignment with the context details and exclusion of irrelevant information."
