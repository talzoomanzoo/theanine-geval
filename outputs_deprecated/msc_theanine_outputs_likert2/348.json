Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on!\nSpeaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar.\nSpeaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes. Speaker A learned how to make jello from their grandma, turning it into a family tradition.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker A's connection to jello through their grandmother, which ties into Speaker B's discussion about teaching their kids a jello recipe from their grandmother. This shared experience of turning jello making into a family tradition is relevant. However, the MEMORY's suggestion that Speaker B can consider Speaker A's grandma as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes seems a bit out of place and doesn't naturally connect to the context or any previous interaction explicitly mentioned. The relevance and causality could be clearer or more directly tied to what has been discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
