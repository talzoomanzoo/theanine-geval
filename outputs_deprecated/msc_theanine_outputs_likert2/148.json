Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?\nSpeaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping?\nSpeaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp?\nSpeaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer?\nSpeaker A: I've only camped in a tent so far, but would like to try out a camper trailer. What do use for camping?\nSpeaker B: We usually do tents but we have camped in yurts too. Did you go to the zoo last weekend?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is away from their child and glad that the pets are with them. Speaker B is considering calling in sick to work to go to the zoo with their child.\nSpeaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities. Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys. Speaker B's daughter likes monkeys and is starting to assert her independence.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information: for example, Speaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and Speaker B's daughter likes monkeys, which could provide a connection to Speaker B's sudden question about the zoo. However, the memory does not provide any information directly relevant to the camping discussion, which is the primary focus of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Furthermore, the sentences in the MEMORY are somewhat disjointed, lacking clear connections or causality that would directly enhance the ongoing conversation about camping or smoothly lead into a new topic about the zoo. Thus, while there is some useful information, the overall coherence and relevance to the dialogue could be improved."
