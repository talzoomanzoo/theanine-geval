Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies!\nSpeaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?  \nSpeaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere!\nSpeaker B: You have a point.  It is nice to see puppies wagging their tail and just following you!  Changing topics, do you have any recipes with asparagus?  You know, it's such a popular vegetable, but I just don't know how to prepare it.\nSpeaker A: I don't have recipes but I know how to make a good grilled asparagus. Are you looking to bolster your chef book?\nSpeaker B: I sure am!  Grilled asparagus does sound good.  Do you pair the grilled asparagus with your fajitas?  What do you prefer, chicken or beef fajitas?\nSpeaker A: I prefer chicken to beef. I pair it with beef fajitas andI think it's great to have with a glass of merlot. Do you like wine?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B used to foster puppies but no longer does, and is working on a project to build their resume and is unsure about the type of work they want to do.\nSpeaker A enjoys cooking, especially making fajitas, and also volunteers at animal shelters.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speakers A and B that could guide Speaker B's responses. For example, knowing that Speaker B used to foster puppies explains their interest in comparing puppies and kittens and might influence their engagement in the conversation about pets. Additionally, knowledge that Speaker A enjoys cooking and volunteers at animal shelters aligns with the topics discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as cooking strategies and experiences with animals. However, the MEMORY could improve by explicitly linking how past experiences connect to the ongoing dialogue about cooking or fostering. Thus, it is somewhat helpful, but the connection could be made clearer and more comprehensive to earn a higher score."
