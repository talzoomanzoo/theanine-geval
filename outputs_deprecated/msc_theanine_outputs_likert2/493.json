Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for.\nSpeaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for?\nSpeaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\nSpeaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise? \nSpeaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows.\nSpeaker A: That sounds wonderful! You'd get to just be out in nature all day. Sounds like a great job, especially if you're a bit introverted like me. That's why hiking is my favorite -- a good solitary activity. \nSpeaker B: Yes, I agree. What kind of hours would this new job have?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A, a recent high school graduate on a cross-country journey looking for jobs, is planning to potentially visit the Columbia Trail and Ken Lockwood Gorge for a camping and hiking trip. They also applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail with the intention of using the money earned to buy a hammock online. This hammock will be left by the river for anyone to use at a hidden spot off the main hiking trail, and Speaker A now has a portable hammock for the hike, wondering if Speaker B will bring theirs.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "The grocery store job would have varying hours, but I'm hoping to work around my hiking and camping trips.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that helps in understanding Speaker A's interest in hiking and their future plans, which could relate to their excitement about the new job located near a hiking trail. This is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where they mention liking solitude activities like hiking. Additionally, the memory about purchasing a hammock and enjoying nature activities would support the context where Speaker A discusses their introverted nature and favorite solitary activities. However, the MEMORY lacks clear causality or direct relevance to the current job conversation, such as their intention of using their job earnings, and it does not build a clear conversational thread from the past interactions between Speakers A and B. More context on why Speaker A is interested in working at this specific grocery store or past conversations with Speaker B could enhance the helpfulness of the MEMORY."
