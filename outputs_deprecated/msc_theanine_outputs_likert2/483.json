Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \nSpeaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!).\nSpeaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol\nSpeaker B: I am up for the challenge! I have a few tricks up my sleeve to deal with people like you.\nSpeaker A: Oh geez that makes me sound difficult.lol  Do you have any new speeches coming up?\nSpeaker B: Nope, I just cleared my schedule until the Alps marathon that you're training for. It's just you and me until you break that finish line. I'm going to start sending you a motivational quote every morning at 4 am when I want you to wake up.\nSpeaker A: Wow 4 am.  Is it too late to change my mind?lol\nSpeaker B: Yes. We have an iron-clad written agreement. Tell me how I'm doing so far. Is this the most motivated you've ever been in your entire life?\nSpeaker A: No, but that's why I have you.  You're going to push me to do the things I can't bring myself to do.  I'll have more motivation tomorrow.  Today was a long work day.lol\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A, a runner who dislikes traveling but has visited 20 countries, is now working on improving their mile time and training for a marathon. This has caused Speaker A to seek advice on how to recover from training for marathons. In response, Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and planning to meet at the beach at 0600.\n\nSpeaker B, who travels frequently for work and misses their wife and kids, shares the same topic with Speaker A in improving mile time and training for a marathon. Speaker B is also a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks. Additionally, Speaker B mentioned combining fishing with feeling depressed, and taking young boys to the pond during school hours as a joke.\n\nSpeaker B, reacting to missing their family due to frequent travel, has previously run a marathon and found it tough but rewarding. This experience has caused Speaker B's desire to motivate people to be successful and follow their dreams. Speaker A suggested that Speaker B should combine something more active with feeling depressed to avoid dwelling on negative thoughts.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some relevant background information that could be helpful in generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It elaborates on Speaker A's and Speaker B's shared interests and motivations regarding running and the marathon, which is relevant to the dialogue. However, the MEMORY also includes extraneous details, such as the mention of Speaker A's dislike of traveling and Speaker B's fishing joke, which are not directly pertinent to the ongoing dialogue. Additionally, the MEMORY could be better organized to more clearly illustrate the development and causality of past interactions between Speaker A and Speaker B, which would enhance its helpfulness in crafting a response. As it stands, while some connections to the context are present, they are not particularly strong or well-developed."
