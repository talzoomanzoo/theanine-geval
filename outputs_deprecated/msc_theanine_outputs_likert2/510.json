Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well?\nSpeaker B: The older one seems to like it while the youngest cannot be bothered. Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon?\nSpeaker A: Yes!  As a matter of fact, I'm visiting my son that lives in Spain next month.  This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A's boys have been out of town for a while and are leaving again in a few months, but Speaker A's sons will be coming for winter break from Europe. \nSpeaker A enjoys different cuisines like Mexican, Italian, and Chinese, and her two sons have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next, which causes Speaker A's son and his girlfriend to study to be chefs in college.\nSpeaker A's sons play video games and listen to music in their rooms, and Speaker A's youngest son is addicted to social media and video games.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that can aid in generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker A's sons have been studying abroad in Spain, which correlates with Speaker A's plan to visit her son in Spain and meet his girlfriend. However, the information about cuisines and being chefs might not be directly relevant to the current context of a conversation about visiting sons. Additionally, the mention of sons playing video games and the younger one's hobbies do not necessarily contribute to the main context or the causality of visiting Europe. The MEMORY could be more concise and focused on the immediate topic of traveling and family relations, which would make it more helpful."
