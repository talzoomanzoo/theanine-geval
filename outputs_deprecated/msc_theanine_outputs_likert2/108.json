Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends?\nSpeaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do.\nSpeaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars.\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I think they go dark for a couple months and then have daylight for a couple months! I actually like night time, but having daylight all the time will make me crazy lol. Yeah I kind of hope it's dark for the camping but it will be very cold. I have heard Alaska has delicious ice cream. I want to try that while I'm there, \nSpeaker A: You'd have to get some serious blackout curtains for when it was daylight lol! You'll have to stock up on some warm essentials before heading out. You definitely don't want to get stuck in a bad situation in the cold, especially if you're alone. I bet they have great ice cream! You'll have to tell me about it when you get back!\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I need to call my friend and find out what season they are in so I can pack accordingly. I will take pictures of the ice cream too so I can tell you about it. I wonder if there are a lot of bears there? I don't like bears either.\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty sure they have grizzlies up there. You better pack something to fend them off too just in case. I bet your friend knows everything you'd need to keep them away.\nSpeaker B: I will bring whatever they let me bring on the airplane, but I am really counting on my friend to help me out with the local customs lol. Do you know if Rocky and Bullwinkle were from Alaska? \nSpeaker A: No, they were from Minnesota. Are you going to have your friend be your hiking guide?\nSpeaker B: I invited my friend to come stay at the lodge where I'm vacationing and he said it would be fun to get away for a bit. So I'm hoping he will show me around for a week or so. I might have to hire a hiking guide, it depends on how much he knows about hiking and grizzlies I think. What do you think? Should I hire someone?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet. Speaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking.\nSpeaker A is working on going back in time. Speaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together.\nSpeaker B has programming experience but has not created their own invention. Speaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet. Speaker B is unsure about what else there is to do in Alaska besides hiking.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "It's probably a good idea to have a hiking guide, especially with the potential grizzly encounters. Your friend can still show you around, but having a professional guide could ensure your safety.",
    "prediction": "**Helpfulness Score: 1**\n\nThe MEMORY contains some basic information about Speaker B planning an Alaskan vacation and Speaker A's familiarity with outdoor activities, but it is repetitive and lacks relevant details. It repeats the fact that Speaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation three times, without adding any new, helpful information each time. Besides, the context of \"Speaker A is working on going back in time\" and \"Speaker B has programming experience but has not created their own invention\" are irrelevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about the Alaskan trip, daylight conditions, ice cream, bears, and hiking guide. There's no natural connection, development of past interactions, or useful detail that would help in generating a proper next response based on the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Therefore, MEMORY does not fulfill the criterion of providing helpful, relevant information and exhibits a poor level of connectivity and relevance to the dialogue."
