Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'm going to Costa Rica! Have you ever been there?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B's new car is black, and it is their first new car after driving pre-owned cars before. Speaker A is worried about gas mileage and asks about the fuel efficiency of Speaker B's car.\n2. Speaker B used to have quiet spring breaks, contrasting with Speaker B's plans for a more adventurous one. Speaker B is going on a trip but has not started packing yet.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nMEMORY contains some useful pieces of information that are somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. In particular, Memory 2 hints at Speaker B's travel plans and interest in having a more adventurous time, which aligns with the upcoming trip to Costa Rica mentioned in the dialogue. This provides some context and continuity regarding Speaker B's plans for the trip. However, most of the information in Memory 1 about Speaker Bâ€™s car does not contribute directly to generating a relevant response based on the current dialogue context, which focuses on travel, not cars. The connections made within the memories are not particularly strong or causally linked to the immediate travel discussion, indicating there is room for improvement in terms of coherence and direct relevance to the current dialogue context."
