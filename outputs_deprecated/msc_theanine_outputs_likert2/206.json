Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college?\nSpeaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position. \nSpeaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it?\nSpeaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \nSpeaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living.\nSpeaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime?\nSpeaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with.\nSpeaker A: Sounds great! Now the tough question: when do you have time?\nSpeaker B: It would have to be sometime when I'm off work, maybe on the weekend. \nSpeaker A: OK. Just let me know when you want to plan it and I will put in the reservation request. Do you need to borrow cleats or anything? I am a size 11.5.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket, but now plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week. Additionally, Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments. \nSpeaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United. \nSpeaker A enjoys playing soccer and is studying Humanities in college with the goal of finishing before looking for a job. They are seeking career advice from a guidance counselor and considering options in humanities or teaching.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant background information about both speakers that could be useful for generating a proper response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures Speaker A's involvement in soccer, which aligns with the context of planning a friendly soccer match, and it mentions Speaker B's experience playing soccer in college, which connects with their interest in playing again. Additionally, the MEMORY includes pertinent details about Speaker A's academic pursuits and career considerations, which could help shape future dialogues. The sentences are logically connected and offer insights into the interests and activities of both speakers, making them beneficial for maintaining the flow of conversation. However, there is a bit of extra information regarding Speaker A's studies and career advice, which is not directly relevant to the specific context of planning a soccer gathering. Adjusting the focus could enhance relevancy further, but overall, MEMORY provides a helpful background."
