Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it?\nSpeaker B: Yes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see. \nSpeaker A: I definitely will, this sounds like such an amazing trip. How long has it been since you've been there yourself?\nSpeaker B: I was in Greece last two years ago.   I am excited to go again soon!    At somepoint I would like to take a cruise around the islands there.  It seems like a neat way to see all the Islands in an easy way.   Have you ever taken a cruise?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both enjoy reading and are librarians. Speaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian. Speaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five. Speaker B recommends visiting the Parthenon, Acropolis of Athens, and the beach on Corfu Island in Greece.\n\nSpeaker B has three kids. Speaker A has kids and is familiar with Greek mythology. Speaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five. Speaker B and their kids are excited about their upcoming trip to Greece.\n\nSpeaker B enjoys being outside and reading Star Wars novels. Speaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian. Speaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five. Speaker B recommends visiting the Parthenon, Acropolis of Athens, and the beach on Corfu Island in Greece.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "No, I haven't taken a cruise before, but it sounds like a fantastic way to explore the Greek Islands. I'll have to consider it for a future trip.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly about Speaker B's excitement about traveling to Greece, which matches their discussion about travel and the Acropolis. This is helpful in understanding Speaker B's enthusiasm and personal connection to the topic, potentially enriching future responses. Details about Speaker B's family and trip plans can be useful for generative context about managing travel with a family and could naturally align with the conversation were it to expand further into detailed travel experiences or recommendations.\n\nHowever, much of the MEMORY doesn't directly aid in crafting the next response. Redundant information—such as Speaker B's excitement about Greece and Athena being a perfect goddess for a librarian—is repeated multiple times. Additionally, certain facts, like being librarians or enjoying reading and Star Wars novels, while adding depth to the characters, don't directly contribute to developing the current line of dialogue about the Acropolis or future cruise plans. The connections between these elements are not clearly articulated to show causality or natural progression in the conversation. Thus, while MEMORY provides some helpful insights, there is room for improvement in how information is structured and connected."
