Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B's mom is a nurse and busy with work, which led Speaker B to become a therapist, mentioning the ups and downs of the profession. Speaker B is concerned about the cost of owning horses, including medical fees and expenses like horse shoes, and is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories.\n\nSpeaker A is involved in horse breeding and taking care of horses, working at a stable and enjoying being around horses. Speaker A mentions that horses often hurt themselves while exercising, leading to potential medical costs.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I do still enjoy being a therapist, but it definitely has its challenges. It's rewarding to help people navigate through their struggles.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context that could potentially be useful for generating a response. It mentions Speaker B's motivation to enter the therapist profession due to their mom's influence, indicating a connection and possible conversation topic. However, it doesn't clearly align with the specific question about whether Speaker B still enjoys being a therapist, as it shifts focus to their concern about horse costs, which seems disconnected from the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While the background information on both speakers gives some insight into their interests, the transitions and relevance to the ongoing conversation are not entirely smooth or directly supportive of generating a logical next response."
