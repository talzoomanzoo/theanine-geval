Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer?\nSpeaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to?\nSpeaker A: The museum has all sorts of galleries.  It has a sculpture garden outside.  I mostly like the impressionist paintings.  I like Van Gogh.  Was your concert outdoors?\nSpeaker B: Yes. That way they could have a fireworks show too. I love fireworks. Have you ever seen the fireworks at the Disney castle?\nSpeaker A: No, but I have been to Disney World in Florida.  I love fireworks too.  I want to get married on the 4th of July.  That was we will have a national holiday and fireworks for us every year!  It sounds like you've been to Disneyland?\nSpeaker B: No, but I thought you might have since you lived in LA for awhile. Did you get to see any live Disney music performances while you were at Disney World?\nSpeaker A: No, we rode a lot of rides that broke down.  We had to be rescued from the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.  It was stuck.  Someone put on waders and pushed us to the side to climb out.\nSpeaker B: Oh no! Hopefully your trip to the art museum is much better than that. Did your boyfriend go to Disney World too?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys living in the city for the accessibility to food, live music, and museums. This is why Speaker A is planning to visit the Museum of Art of São Paulo next week with their boyfriend. \nSpeaker B enjoys living in the city for the accessibility to food, live music, and museums.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The memory does contain some relevant information about Speaker B's interest in live music and museums, which are topics touched upon in the dialogue context. However, the memory is repetitive and lacks natural connection between the sentences. The causality or logical flow between the different pieces of information about Speaker B is not clearly demonstrated. Specifically, it doesn't tie in well with the immediate conversation about art museums, Disney experiences, and Independence Day fireworks. Additionally, the mention of Speaker A's plans to visit the Museum of Art of São Paulo are disconnected from the current dialogue, which focuses on a different museum visit and experiences at Disney. Overall, while there are some relevant points, the memory doesn't provide much helpful or smoothly connected information to improve response generation."
