Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive.\nSpeaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price?\nSpeaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music\nSpeaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it.\nSpeaker A: I'll keep trying! Have you had any luck lately?\nSpeaker B: No I haven't! I keep hoping that I will so I can buy my dreamhouse but I know the chances are low.\nSpeaker A: Would you move to the city? It'd be too much for me\nSpeaker B: I would love to be able to have a country house and a city house to be able to come and go to each one as I please. doesn't that sound like a dream come true?\nSpeaker A: It would be convenient for seeing concerts in the city, yes. I'm not used to the business, though\nSpeaker B: Yeah I understand that. Have you listened to any new blues songs lately?\nSpeaker A: I've started a playlist but haven't had time yet. Any recommendations for female blues performers?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B have a friendly interaction and part ways on a positive note. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B and their family could stay over at the farm after the concert, as they both dream of having a city and country house or a summer and winter home. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win, as they both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot. \n\nSpeaker A has never been to college and values the peaceful life of working on the farm. Speaker B expresses interest in potentially moving out of the city and enjoying a more peaceful life on the farm, as they both dream of having a city and country house or a summer and winter home.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "How about checking out artists like Etta James or Koko Taylor? They have some amazing blues songs that you might enjoy.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the shared dream of having a city and country house, and the discussion around playing the lotto. This aligns with Speaker B's comments about wanting to buy a dream house and potentially living in both environments. However, the MEMORY also introduces new elements like Speaker A suggesting Speaker B and their family stay over at the farm after the concert, and Speaker A's background of never having been to college and enjoying farm life, which are not reflected in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The connection and causality of events are present but not fully aligned with the ongoing discussion. Therefore, the MEMORY is moderately helpful but misses some direct relevance to the last dialogue turn, where music recommendations are discussed."
