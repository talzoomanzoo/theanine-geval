    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science. Speaker B is considering getting a master's degree after completing their bachelor's and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\nSpeaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you, I appreciate the support. Teaching robotics sounds fascinating, I'm sure you'd excel in that field.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that can help in generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It provides context about Speaker B's major in linguistics and their consideration of becoming a college professor, which aligns with the discussion about career options and teaching. It also conveys Speaker A's interest in teaching robotics, which is consistent with the context where Speaker A mentions teaching robotics someday. However, the MEMORY contains some repeated information, such as Speaker B majoring in linguistics and seeking practical job opportunities, which could have been more concise. Overall, the MEMORY is helpful and naturally connected to the dialogue context, justifying a score of 4."
