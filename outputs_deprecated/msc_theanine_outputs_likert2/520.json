Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer?\nSpeaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys living in a big city for the accessibility to food, live music, museums, and trying different foods. They and their boyfriend also look forward to having some refreshing beers by the beach.\nSpeaker B has 2 older and 1 younger brother, and their father used to be a farmer. They were born in Brazil, specifically in Sao Paulo. Speaker A is interested in music concerts and planning a trip to Sao Paulo to do lots of shopping. Speaker B enjoys living in the city for the accessibility to food and live music, and is waiting for bands to announce their summer tour schedule to plan which shows to attend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides several pieces of information that are directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It offers insight into Speaker A's interest in music concerts and their enjoyment of city life, which ties well with the question about the music concert. It also mentions Speaker B's interest in live music and their anticipation of summer concerts, which directly relates to the concert topic currently being discussed. Additionally, it briefly touches on Speaker A's potential plans related to Sao Paulo, which might not be directly relevant to the immediate context but can offer future conversational topics. However, there are parts of MEMORY, such as Speaker B's family details, that seem less directly connected. Nonetheless, most sentences provide helpful background information for generating responses in ongoing conversations. Thus, the MEMORY is mostly coherent and relevant but not perfect, which results in a score of 4."
