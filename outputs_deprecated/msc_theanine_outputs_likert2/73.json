Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "raw_prediction": " I learned to surf when I was a kid, just spending a lot of time in the water. It's all about practice and patience, like learning any new skill.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some background information about Speaker B's interest in fishing and lack of time for surfing, and Speaker A's background in surfing and music. However, these details, although somewhat relevant due to the mention of music and surfing in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, are not very helpful for generating the next response. The MEMORY does not directly connect to the ongoing conversation about music instruments, specifically learning and teaching, or the current discussion on favorite bands and personal experiences relating to music or surfing. The information about surfing and growing up on the beach is loosely connected but lacks clear causality or direct relevance to the conversation."
