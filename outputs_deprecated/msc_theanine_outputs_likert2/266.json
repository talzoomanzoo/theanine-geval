Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go?\nSpeaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is studying sports medicine in college and has been consistently receiving A's in the class, feeling pressured to maintain good grades to avoid embarrassing their mother who is in charge of the school.\n   \n2. Speaker B, who is pursuing sports medicine in college, shares a common struggle with Speaker A who finds history class boring. Speaker B is overwhelmed by their mother's strictness and looks forward to completing school to escape the pressure.\n\n3. Speaker A believes that sports can demonstrate equality among all individuals, while Speaker B, who is training in sports medicine, is under pressure to excel academically to avoid upsetting their mother who is in charge of the school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great that you only have one more final left to go. You must be looking forward to finishing up the semester.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some details about Speaker B's academic situation and their mother's influence; however, it doesn't directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context revolves around exams and studying, but MEMORY primarily focuses on Speaker B's field of study (sports medicine) and their personal pressures, rather than providing information that naturally connects to or enhances the specifics of the current conversation. The details, while relevant to Speaker Bâ€™s academic life, do not seem to aid significantly in generating a continuation of the current dialogue. Furthermore, the sentences in MEMORY sound repetitive rather than progressively informative or causally connected."
