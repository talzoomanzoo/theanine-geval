    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\nSpeaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car?\nSpeaker B: Yes, there are several. Hope we could meet and You possibly teach me about computer programming.\nSpeaker A: That would be great too. I like to program in several different languages. Do you have a preference?\nSpeaker B: No, I'm just getting started so I don't have a preference. Maybe you could show me what you prefer and we could start there.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B works as a shipping clerk at warehouse for 15 hours a week. Speaker A just started a new job in computer programming. Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming. \nSpeaker B does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies. Speaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming. \nSpeaker B enjoys cruising in their car while listening to punk music. Speaker A enjoys the food and the adventure of cruises. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Perfect, we can start with Python, it's a great language to begin with. I'll show you the basics.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does a good job of containing information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures key elements such as Speaker A's offer to teach Speaker B how to swim and program, which aligns with their conversation. It notes Speaker B's enjoyment of punk music and cruising in the car, both of which connect to the context of making playlists and discussing travel. Additionally, the mention of cruises and programming are relevant, as these topics come up in the dialogue. The MEMORY is structured with naturally connected sentences, which clearly demonstrate the relationships and interests between the speakers. However, some details, such as Speaker B's job, do not directly influence the current dialogue context, which prevents it from scoring a perfect 5."
