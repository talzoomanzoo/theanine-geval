Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons\nSpeaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use.\nSpeaker B: I am a little scared of needles though. Were your tattoos painful?\nSpeaker A: Most of them were not.  It really depends on where on your body you get them.  Most of mine are on areas that didn't hurt.  The one on my foot and the one behind my ear did hurt a good bit.  Where were you thinking about getting it?\nSpeaker B: I hadn't really thought about it! Maybe upper arm or upper back? But I'm no tattoo expert. And I'd have to get permission from my wife first, LOL\nSpeaker A: Definitely talk to her first.  I had a friend that didn't talk to his wife and just came home with a tattoo one day.  It led to a huge fight - both about the money he spent and not discussing it with her.  He slept on my couch for over a week!\nSpeaker B: Oh no! Yeah, you don't want to spring something like that on your spouse. I don't think you mentioned before, are you married?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest because Speaker A works at a coffee shop that their mom owned.\n2. Speaker A wants to work at a coffee shop and is saving up for their next tattoo because Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father.\n3. Speaker A wants to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest because Speaker A's favorite tattoo is the one dedicated to their late father, saying \"for you I shall live\".\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm not married, but I have seen firsthand how important communication is in a relationship, especially when it comes to tattoos.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could support a language model like Speaker A in generating a proper next response, especially regarding Speaker A's existing tattoos dedicated to their late father and the context around their tattoo decisions. However, the memory does not include any information on whether Speaker A is married, which would directly address the current question in the dialogue. Additionally, the sentences in the memory have some redundancy, and the structure could be improved for a more coherent narrative that clearly connects with Speaker B's questions. As presented, the memory lacks natural connections and causality relevant to the ongoing conversation about tattoos and marital considerations."
