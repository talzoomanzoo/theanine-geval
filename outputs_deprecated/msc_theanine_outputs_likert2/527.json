Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer?\nSpeaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to?\nSpeaker A: The museum has all sorts of galleries.  It has a sculpture garden outside.  I mostly like the impressionist paintings.  I like Van Gogh.  Was your concert outdoors?\nSpeaker B: Yes. That way they could have a fireworks show too. I love fireworks. Have you ever seen the fireworks at the Disney castle?\nSpeaker A: No, but I have been to Disney World in Florida.  I love fireworks too.  I want to get married on the 4th of July.  That was we will have a national holiday and fireworks for us every year!  It sounds like you've been to Disneyland?\nSpeaker B: No, but I thought you might have since you lived in LA for awhile. Did you get to see any live Disney music performances while you were at Disney World?\nSpeaker A: No, we rode a lot of rides that broke down.  We had to be rescued from the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.  It was stuck.  Someone put on waders and pushed us to the side to climb out.\nSpeaker B: Oh no! Hopefully your trip to the art museum is much better than that. Did your boyfriend go to Disney World too?\nSpeaker A: No, I had a cousin that I went with.  We stayed in a hotel in Miami too and I got so sunburned on the beach!  I'm sure the art museum will be good if it isn't too crowded.  Was your concert crowded?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B was born in Brazil, specifically in San Paulo. - (Reason) - Speaker B recommends visiting the Museum of Art of São Paulo in the city. - (React) - Speaker A is planning to visit the Museum of Art of São Paulo next week with their boyfriend.\nSpeaker B drove over 1000 miles to see their favorite band, Three Dog Night. - (SameTopic) - Speaker A enjoys going to museums and trying different foods. - (Changed) - Speaker A plans to do lots of shopping during their trip.\nSpeaker A loves Disney music. - (SameTopic) - Speaker B enjoys living in the city for the accessibility to food and live music. - (Changed) - Speaker A's boyfriend enjoys drinking, so they are looking for good bars or clubs to enjoy the night.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "Yes, it was pretty crowded, but the energy was amazing. Do you and your boyfriend enjoy going to concerts together?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided includes several distinct pieces of information, but many of them are unrelated or only partially related to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The mention of Speaker B driving over 1000 miles for a concert is somewhat relevant to the topic of music concerts in the conversation, but it does not provide a clear development or causality that helps in generating a response related to the context. The MEMORY also states that Speaker A loves Disney music, which could be marginally helpful considering the discussion of Disney themes. However, the details about Speaker B's birthplace and recommendation to visit a specific museum in São Paulo are not connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which talks about art museums, but not specifically the Museum of Art of São Paulo or a trip to Brazil. Overall, while there are some potentially relevant details, they are not well-integrated or clearly linked to the ongoing conversation, making the MEMORY only minimally helpful."
