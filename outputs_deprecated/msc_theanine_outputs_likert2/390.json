Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A's interest in animals, specifically raccoons and bearded dragons, was sparked by their work in software solutions for tech companies, which they find less exciting than being a zoo keeper. They are currently dealing with a raccoon problem and plan to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes. Additionally, Speaker B has been taking care of a raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful contextual information for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It indicates Speaker A's recent experience and interactions with raccoons, noting their plan to buy aluminum sheeting to cover holes, which directly complements the current context where they mention obtaining the sheeting. This connection reinforces Speaker A's continuous involvement with the raccoon issue. \n\nAdditionally, the MEMORY mentions that Speaker B has been taking care of a raccoon, which is relevant to the ongoing conversation and might influence the course of the dialogue, e.g., Speaker B might share their experiences or provide advice on managing the raccoon problem. \n\nThe MEMORY sentences are indeed naturally connected to Speaker A's statement about installing the sheeting and can contribute to a more coherent and enriched dialogue, making it a helpful resource for Speaker B's next response. However, not all of the MEMORY is directly usable in the response, such as the mention of Speaker A's work and interest in bearded dragons, which makes it fall short of a perfect score."
