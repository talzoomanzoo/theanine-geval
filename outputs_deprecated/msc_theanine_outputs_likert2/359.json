Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week?\nSpeaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you?\nSpeaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions?\n\nMEMORY:\n- Speaker B plays a lot of video games, specifically League of Legends, and owns a new gaming laptop. As a result, Speaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII.\n- Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World. Consequently, Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n- Speaker A prefers tamer video games and is not a fan of horror movies. This leads to Speaker A being hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World. In response, Speaker B mentions that Resident Evil can be scary and provides some tips for playing it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "How about trying out a game like Stardew Valley or Minecraft? They're more relaxed and less intense compared to Resident Evil.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It clearly outlines Speaker A's preferences and hesitance regarding scary games, specifically mentioning their enjoyment of Jurassic Park: World. This is relevant as Speaker A is looking for game suggestions, and knowing their previous gaming choices can guide Speaker Bâ€™s recommendations. Additionally, it highlights Speaker B's gaming habits, including their interest in League of Legends and Resident Evil, which could be pertinent in shaping their suggestions. The information is connected, showing causality and relevance to the current dialogue, though some parts could be more concise or focused on Speaker A's request for suggestions beyond Resident Evil."
