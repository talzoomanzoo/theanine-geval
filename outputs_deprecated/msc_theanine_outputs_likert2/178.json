Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know. \nSpeaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like.\nSpeaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys Mexican food and drinks, and plays music for fun. This interest leads to Speaker A frequenting live band venues and playing music at home. The topic of music is also shared with Speaker B, as both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n\nSpeaker A owns a Subaru Legacy and mentions having a baby on the way, causing Speaker B's wife to be pregnant and currently in the second trimester while still working. Due to the pregnancy, Speaker B's wife is considering attending a local festival for just a day. This topic of family planning is further explored when Speaker A expresses uncertainty about settling down with a partner and having kids.\n\nEven though Speaker A does not live in Mexico, they enjoy Mexican food and women. This preference contrasts with Speaker B, who is not going out drinking much due to their wife's pregnancy. Both Speaker A and Speaker B, however, engage in discussions about the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great plan! It'll be nice to have everyone together for the festival.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly concerning the interest in bluegrass music, which is central to the conversation topic about the Bluegrass show. Additionally, the MEMORY mentions Speaker B's wife's pregnancy, which might relate to the consideration of staying at the cabin as a more comfortable option than camping. However, the connection between Speaker B's wife's pregnancy and Speaker A's expected child is stated in an unnaturally convoluted way, making it difficult to clearly follow the relevant information without confusion. Moreover, not all details, such as Speaker A's car or preferences for Mexican food and women, are directly linked to the context of attending a festival. The MEMORY does provide some context that could be helpful, but the connections could be more clearly articulated to emphasize the relevant points regarding attending the music festival."
