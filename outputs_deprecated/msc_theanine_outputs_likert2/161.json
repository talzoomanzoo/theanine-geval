Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it!\nSpeaker B: I'm glad you liked it. My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to?\nSpeaker A: I recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca. It was super cute and made me want to go visit Italy, but that was too expensive, so instead I booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month. What about you?\nSpeaker B: I have been relaxing with the kids as much as I have. My husband has been busy with work, so we haven't had time for anything big. I would love to visit Italy some day though if we get the chance. Have you ever been to Italy before?\nSpeaker A: I have never gone to Italy because I'm always so busy. If I ever go, I would want to spend a month there, but work has been hectic lately. Would your kids go with you if you went to Italy?\nSpeaker B: Absolutely! I'd love to travel all over the world with my family to see everything. Hawaii sounds like just as much fun though. What are you most excited about doing when you get there?\nSpeaker A: I'm extremely excited about the sunset tour. Each day is at a new location to watch the sunset. It's suppose to be romantic, but I am just going alone, so I see it as more calming than anything.\nSpeaker B: I hope you have a lot fun. It sounds like a nice time to get away from everything. You should eat as much of the local Hawaiian food as you can. Have you had Hawaiian food before? I think it's great.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B's kids enjoy watching Disney movies, which Speaker B also finds good, causing Speaker A to have seen the Disney movie 'Luca' recently. \nSpeaker B enjoys watching movies with her kids, which leads Speaker B's kids to enjoy watching Disney movies and find them good, resulting in Speaker B's kids enjoying watching 'Luca' and saying it was good. \nSpeaker B enjoys watching movies with her kids, leading Speaker A to enjoy watching sunsets and mention seeing a great sunset recently, wanting to experience it more, resulting in Speaker A booking a \"Hawaii Sunset\" tour for next month and being excited about it being their first time.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY has some relevant information, such as the connection between Speaker B's enjoyment of Disney movies with her kids and Speaker A's recent viewing of \"Luca.\" However, it lacks clarity and natural connection in its structure, making it difficult to see direct causality in the way conversations typically progress. The repetition and redundancy in mentioning Speaker B's kids enjoy watching Disney movies make it convoluted. The connection from enjoying movies to Speaker A booking a Hawaii sunset tour is not logically presented in the MEMORY. Overall, MEMORY lacks coherence and doesn't provide structured insight into generating the next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
