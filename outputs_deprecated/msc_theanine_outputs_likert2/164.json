Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it!\nSpeaker B: I'm glad you liked it. My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to?\nSpeaker A: I recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca. It was super cute and made me want to go visit Italy, but that was too expensive, so instead I booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month. What about you?\nSpeaker B: I have been relaxing with the kids as much as I have. My husband has been busy with work, so we haven't had time for anything big. I would love to visit Italy some day though if we get the chance. Have you ever been to Italy before?\nSpeaker A: I have never gone to Italy because I'm always so busy. If I ever go, I would want to spend a month there, but work has been hectic lately. Would your kids go with you if you went to Italy?\nSpeaker B: Absolutely! I'd love to travel all over the world with my family to see everything. Hawaii sounds like just as much fun though. What are you most excited about doing when you get there?\nSpeaker A: I'm extremely excited about the sunset tour. Each day is at a new location to watch the sunset. It's suppose to be romantic, but I am just going alone, so I see it as more calming than anything.\nSpeaker B: I hope you have a lot fun. It sounds like a nice time to get away from everything. You should eat as much of the local Hawaiian food as you can. Have you had Hawaiian food before? I think it's great.\nSpeaker A: No, I acctually haven't. I'm expecting pineapple and ham on everything, but I know they will having some amazing cultural food that is probably going to blow my mind! Is there a specific dish you would recommend\nSpeaker B: I enjoy foods like Spam musubi, loco mocos, and poi. My favorite might be kalua pork. The way they prepare the pig makes it taste so good.\nSpeaker A: That all sounds really good, I will check it out. I saved up a lot of money to splurge on everything. I'm excited to walk the beach, even though I hate the beach.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys spending time with her kids, especially watching movies. Her kids enjoy Disney movies, which Speaker B also finds good. Speaker A recently watched the Disney movie 'Luca' and enjoyed it. \nSpeaker B used to prefer romance and horror movies, but now her kids enjoyed 'Luca' and found it good. \nSpeaker A loves watching sunsets and mentioned seeing a great sunset recently. They have booked a \"Hawaii Sunset\" tour for next month, being excited about it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Walking along the beach during sunset in Hawaii sounds like a dream. I hope you have a fantastic time exploring and enjoying the local cuisine.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY captures several key points from the DIALOGUE CONTEXT that could help a language model in generating a relevant response: Speaker B's enjoyment of spending time with her kids, their shared enjoyment of Disney movies, and Speaker A's recent viewing of \"Luca\" and the upcoming Hawaii Sunset tour. However, the MEMORY also inaccurately states that Speaker B's kids found \"Luca\" good, which wasn't mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the MEMORY lacks some causal or developmental connections, such as mentioning Speaker A's excitement about trying Hawaiian food and exploring the beach. Despite these minor inconsistencies, the MEMORY is overall relevant and provides helpful information about the speakers' interests and experiences."
