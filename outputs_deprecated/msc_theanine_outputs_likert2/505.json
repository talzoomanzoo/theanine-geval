Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive.\nSpeaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price?\nSpeaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music\nSpeaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it.\nSpeaker A: I'll keep trying! Have you had any luck lately?\nSpeaker B: No I haven't! I keep hoping that I will so I can buy my dreamhouse but I know the chances are low.\nSpeaker A: Would you move to the city? It'd be too much for me\nSpeaker B: I would love to be able to have a country house and a city house to be able to come and go to each one as I please. doesn't that sound like a dream come true?\nSpeaker A: It would be convenient for seeing concerts in the city, yes. I'm not used to the business, though\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A, who was born and raised as a preacher's kid in the country and worked on a produce farm, suggests that Speaker B and their family could stay over at the farm after the concert. They discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\n\nAfter a friendly interaction, Speaker A and Speaker B part ways on a positive note, having both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n\nSpeaker A, who has never been to college and values the peaceful life of working on the farm, reacts as Speaker B expresses interest in potentially moving out of the city and enjoying a more peaceful life on the farm. Both speakers dream of having a city and country house or a summer and winter home.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "It sounds like the best of both worlds, being able to enjoy the city life and the peacefulness of the countryside.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context that could be useful for the language model to generate a response. It mentions Speaker A's background, such as being a preacher's kid and working on a produce farm, which may influence their perspective on the conversation about city versus country living. Additionally, it touches on their shared interest in the lotto and the dream of owning a city and country house, aligning with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT's discussion about the lotto and living arrangements. However, the MEMORY also contains repetitive information and does not clearly demonstrate causality or the natural development of the interaction, which limits its helpfulness. Thus, the MEMORY provides some relevant information, but it lacks coherence and depth for a higher score."
