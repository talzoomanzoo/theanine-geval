Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens?\nSpeaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month\nSpeaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.  Where are you going on vacation?\nSpeaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there!\nSpeaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo?\nSpeaker B: Their zoo is pretty good! It's always crowded, of course, but they have pandas so I'm happy. I would say it's bigger than the DC zoo, but I like that the DC zoo has fewer people.\nSpeaker A: That sounds awesome.  I haven't been to the zoo in so long.  I wish I could go.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B enjoy visiting the zoo, with Speaker A preferring exotic birds and enjoying seeing pandas and penguins, while Speaker B's girlfriend also enjoys pandas and penguins and they visit the zoo regularly. Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend, and Speaker A prefers cockatoos over kittens as pets.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information regarding Speaker B's potential adoption of a kitten, which is directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, it mentions the interest of both speakers in visiting the zoo, which is also relevant as it aligns with their upcoming trip to San Diego. However, the MEMORY contains some extraneous details that are not directly relevant to the current conversation, such as Speaker A's preference for exotic birds or Speaker A's preference for cockatoos over kittens. These details do not necessarily aid in generating a more accurate or contextually improved response. Therefore, while partially useful, the MEMORY could be more focused and relevant."
