Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make?\nSpeaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it.\nSpeaker A: I would love to, I enjoy cooking so maybe you can teach me to make it, too?\nSpeaker B: Yeah definitely! I know you like hot foods, so if you learn and can make them fresh it will taste amazing. Have you tried any new foods lately?\nSpeaker A: Not any new foods, but I did try a new food truck near me that was delicious! It was street tacos and you could pick from barbacoa, chicken, and steak for the protein. Do you like Mexican food? \nSpeaker B: Oh god I do love Mexican food. That was be so hard to pick because they're all so good! Did they have al pastor by any chance? I loved marinated pork tacos.\nSpeaker A: unfortunately no, but I can ask them if they plan to get it in the future. I had one of each and they were all good in their own way. Have you ever had Birra tacos? I'd love to try those next.\nSpeaker B: I've never had birra tacos, what are those? They sound intriguing.\nSpeaker A: If I understand it correctly, the tortilla is dipped in the liquid from the braised meat, and then fried on a flat top. Then filled with the meat that was braised and other toppings that you like. I'll let you know if I find a place that serves these tacos in our area!\nSpeaker B: Wow, my mouth is watering. I'll definitely have to try that. It sounds amazing and might be a new favorite. Is it spicy?\nSpeaker A: I'm not sure, but if I had to guess I'd say a little at least. Do you enjoy spicy food?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A wakes up early in the morning to catch waves, while Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe.\nSpeaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe, which reminds them of the good old days.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I do enjoy spicy food, it adds so much flavor! I'm looking forward to trying those Birra tacos, they sound like a delicious twist on traditional tacos.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant background information about Speaker B's interest in cooking and their attachment to their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe, which is mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as a dish they can make. This connection adds depth to the conversation and highlights why the garlic chicken might be special to Speaker B. However, the MEMORY does not provide information directly related to the specific discussion about spicy foods, Mexican food, or birra tacos, which might make it more helpful. Missing direct connections to these topics prevents the MEMORY from scoring a 5."
