Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming.\nSpeaker A knows how to swim since the age of 5 and offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming.\nSpeaker B does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies; looking forward to eating a pizza burger in a pool with punk music playing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information that ties into the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker B's enjoyment of punk music, which aligns with Speaker A's playlist, and Speaker B's interest in learning to swim, as referenced in the dialogue. However, the MEMORY also includes some unrelated or oddly specific details (such as watching swimming movies and eating a pizza burger) that do not strongly contribute to generating a more coherent or relevant next response in the context of the given dialogue. While there is some connection, the MEMORY could have been more focused on meaningful interactions or developments related to their meeting, music, and programming."
