Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\nSpeaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient! \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B's mom being a nurse and busy with work has influenced Speaker B to become a therapist, where they mention the ups and downs of the profession. Speaker B, living in the city, expresses a desire to have a horse in the future, considering the psychological aspects of owning one and relating it to Freudian theories. \n\nWhen Speaker B offers to discuss the absence of Speaker A's mother and suggests lying down on their couch, Speaker B, as a therapist, talks about the profession's challenges and rewards. Additionally, Speaker B reflects on the costs associated with owning horses, such as medical fees and expenses like horse shoes, and explores the psychological aspects of horse ownership in connection to Freudian theories.\n\nBeing both a therapist and a football fan supporting the Chiefs, Speaker B consistently brings up the ups and downs of the therapy profession. Furthermore, Speaker B contemplates the financial implications of horse ownership, including medical costs and expenses like horse shoes, while also delving into the psychological dimensions of owning a horse through a Freudian lens.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's interesting to know, I didn't realize therapy could be completed in a shorter time frame for some. I'll definitely consider reaching out to you for a session.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context that can be relevant to generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives insight into Speaker B's background, such as their mother's influence on their career choice and their perspective on the therapy profession. This can be helpful in understanding why Speaker B enjoys their job, as discussed in the dialogue. Additionally, the MEMORY touches upon Speaker B's interest in horses and their connection to psychology, which somewhat aligns with Speaker A's mention of finding therapy in horseback riding. This can be beneficial in finding common ground for future interactions. However, the MEMORY lacks clear causality and cohesion in the way these topics are presented, as it jumps between different subjects such as football fandom, Freud, and horse ownership costs, which are not directly related to the ongoing conversation. This makes the overall helpfulness limited."
