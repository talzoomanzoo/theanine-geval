Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A recently bought a dress for Easter and is planning for a spring break trip. Speaker A has a daughter and mentions working and having to take time off. Speaker B suggests California as a destination for Speaker A's trip and has tried surfing before but is not very good at it. Speaker B enjoys Greek mythology and did a case study on Poseidon, the God of the Sea, Earthquakes, and Horses. Speaker B does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology. Speaker A is fascinated by the architecture of Italy and enjoys studying history, especially through reading and watching documentaries. Speaker B recently turned 30. Speaker A is going to a hair appointment for their birthday.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response in the context of Greek mythology and Speaker A's daughter. It notes that Speaker B enjoys Greek mythology and has done a case study on Poseidon, which could be used to generate a relevant response about sharing Greek mythology with Speaker A's daughter. However, other parts of the MEMORY, such as details about trips, surfing, and Speaker A's interests, are less relevant to the immediate dialogue context. The memory does not clearly follow a causal or continuous structure, as it covers a variety of topics without direct connections or relevancy to the current dialogue prompt. Hence, the MEMORY is moderately helpful but could be more focused to score higher."
