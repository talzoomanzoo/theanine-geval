Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, as a therapist, discusses the challenges and rewards of the profession. They also express concerns about the costs associated with owning horses and explore the psychological aspects of horse ownership in relation to Freudian theories. \nSpeaker B's mother being a nurse led to their career as a therapist. They express a desire to have a horse in the future and contemplate the psychological aspects of horse ownership through Freudian theories. \nSpeaker A is experienced in horse breeding and care, working at a stable and enjoying being around horses. They transition from their expertise in horses to their lack of knowledge in psychology.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Therapy can definitely have a beginning, middle, and end, and it's great to hear about your positive experiences with your horses. Let me know if you ever decide to give therapy a try, I'd be more than happy to help.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information that connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the profession of Speaker B as a therapist and Speaker Aâ€™s interest in horses. However, the MEMORY seems somewhat fragmented and broad in some places, such as the mention of Freudian theories and the costs associated with horses, which are not directly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. These elements are not central to the current dialogue or the specific topic of becoming a therapist and the benefits of therapy. Still, the MEMORY is moderately helpful for understanding the general background of the speakers and could assist in generating a response by focusing more on these shared interests and the therapeutic aspect."
