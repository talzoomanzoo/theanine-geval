Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \nSpeaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with?\nSpeaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys cooking and baking, possibly considering turning it into a business. This passion is reflected in the way Speaker A primarily cooks Indian food and bakes a lot of rice dishes. Speaker B's husband, who is an avid cook specializing in Asian cuisine with extensive prep work, might find common ground with Speaker A. \nLiving in a rural area with a farm, Speaker B's lifestyle resonates with Speaker A's interest in converting their culinary skills into a business. Speaker B, not a cook, is intrigued by cooking with a pressure cooker, sparking an interest in Speaker A. \nBoth Speaker A and Speaker B share a love for farm life, with Speaker A owning a farm and indulging in cooking and baking. This connection leads Speaker A to explore using a pressure cooker for recipes such as dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great idea! Shrimp fried rice seems like a delicious and easy recipe to begin with. I'll definitely give it a try. Thanks for the suggestion!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information that can help in generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It provides context about the interests and backgrounds of both speakers. For instance, it mentions Speaker A's passion for cooking and baking, Speaker B's husband's expertise in Asian cuisine, and both speakers' shared interest in farm life. These details are helpful in understanding the dynamic between the speakers and can aid in crafting a response about cooking and pressure cooking. However, the details are not directly connected to the immediate dialogue. The connections and causality between events are implicit rather than explicit, which slightly limits the direct applicability to generating the next response. Therefore, while the MEMORY is somewhat helpful, it is not extremely so, warranting a mid-range score."
