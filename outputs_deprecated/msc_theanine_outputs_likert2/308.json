Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you.\nSpeaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them\nSpeaker A: IN MY HOME?! A TREE? That was not at all what I was thinking. Do they grow well indoors? I am intrigued. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is focused on developing renewable energy sources for their inventions, including a teleportation machine and a time machine. Speaker A is interested in nuclear energy and space exploration, mentioning fusion experiments, causing Speaker A to struggle with gardening but find the idea of space plants intriguing. Speaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden, and also expresses concerns about the fuels used for space travel.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "You might want to consider herbs and small plants for an indoor garden. They require less space and can thrive in pots on windowsills or under grow lights.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context regarding Speaker A's interest in space plants and Speaker B's knowledge about plants and gardening, which are somewhat relevant to the current conversation about gardening. However, the MEMORY seems to focus more on themes related to renewable energy, space exploration, and technological inventions like teleportation and time machines. These aspects are not directly helpful or relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A is looking for gardening advice for indoors. The MEMORY does provide an interesting but weak connection in terms of Speaker B's knowledge about plants, which could be useful for further discussions, but the connection is not clear or detailed enough to be considered very helpful. Overall, the MEMORY lacks strong relevance and natural flow in relation to the specific context of indoor gardening."
