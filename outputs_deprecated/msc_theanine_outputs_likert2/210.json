Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships!\nSpeaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!   I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field?\nSpeaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate?\nSpeaker B: I have another year- so this year is really important I get internships and start making connections in the field.   I love going to the beach too.  What happened with your knees that now cause you so much pain?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A mentioning their neighbor John, who loves soccer, leads Speaker B to study sports medicine, play soccer, and aim to join their college team. This interest causes Speaker B to seek internships in sports medicine and enjoy surfing instead. Speaker B's professors being supportive in writing letters for an internship application causes Speaker A to offer advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field. Speaker B, as a college student playing soccer with peers, transitions to looking for internships in sports medicine, asking professors for letters of recommendation. This change results in Speaker B struggling to find internships and feeling disadvantaged compared to those with connections.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I had a few injuries from playing sports when I was younger, and they just caught up with me over the years. It's great that you're focused on internships and making connections in your field. Keep pushing forward, it will pay off in the long run!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided has some information that may seem relevant, such as Speaker B's interest in sports medicine prompted by Speaker A's neighbor and Speaker B's dealings with internships. However, the MEMORY is generally disjointed and lacks a natural flow or clear causality in the context of the current dialogue. The MEMORY jumps between different aspects of Speaker B's life, such as playing soccer, studying sports medicine, and the involvement of professors, without clearly tying these points together or demonstrating how they relate to the current conversation about internships and Speaker A's experiences.\n\nIn the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, the focus is on the internship opportunity related to sports medicine, Speaker B's education, and Speaker A's previous work as a PA which has already been communicated in the context. However, the MEMORY doesn't particularly add new helpful insights into the conversation as it struggles to coherently connect past events or illustrate how these may impact Speaker A's and B's discussion in a meaningful way that could develop the next response naturally. Thus, while the MEMORY might have some related aspects, overall it does not provide essential or clearly connected information for generating the upcoming dialogue response based on the current context."
