Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin!\nSpeaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name? \nSpeaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls! \nSpeaker B: I see what you meant. Plus the color is beautiful orange. I want to see them together, even I am not a cat person they must be cute together at that time. Once the kitten grows up, situation gonna change to me. How are they, they are doing well?\nSpeaker A: Marmalade is orange too but this is better because the baby is sassy and climbs up my leg to sit on my shoulder. I don't understand how you are not a cat person when you have such a large heart for stray kittens.\nSpeaker B: hehe you're right. But i can't explain that why I am not a cat person to you sorry. How's the weather like today, still good weather to have iced tea out there?\nSpeaker A: It's beautiful. I'm sitting outside while the Spice Girls are chasing bugs in the grass. What did your kids name your cats?\nSpeaker B: ohh so nice sounds like you are enjoying the weather. Still we are discussing about that. Did not name them yet. Also I want to put them back since I am not a big fan of cat\nSpeaker A: That would be cruel to do. You need to rehome them properly or otherwise someone may report you to the authorities for animal abuse. My heart is breaking for your poor cats. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys taking their kitten on trips and has a Subaru. Speaker B, who loves dogs, ends up taking care of stray cats brought home by kids even though they are not a cat person.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I won't put them back, don't worry. I'll make sure they find good homes. It's just a temporary situation.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker B's relationship with cats, which is a recurring topic in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It reveals that Speaker B is not a cat person but still takes care of stray cats brought home by their kids, which aligns with the conversation about naming and caring for cats. The fact that Speaker A enjoys taking their kitten on trips and has a Subaru is less directly relevant to the specific dialogue provided. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it included memory that more directly influences the ongoing context, such as past interactions about naming pets or discussions on animal care. Overall, while there is relevant information connecting to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, the connection is not strong enough to provide a higher helpfulness score."
