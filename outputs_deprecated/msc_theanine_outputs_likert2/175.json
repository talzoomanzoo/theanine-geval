Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me?\nSpeaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week?\nSpeaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day\nSpeaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through\nSpeaker A: Actually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to it. Do you think I will need to rent a car when I'm there, or is it possible to walk and bike in the summer? I always picture huge amounts of snow but I'm not sure if it's like that all year round.\nSpeaker A: I would definitely recommend looking for a rental car to have on hand. There is a town within walking distance from me, but it can be dangerous to walk with the wolves and elk around, especially at night.\nSpeaker B: I imagine so!!! I wouldn't want to run into a wolf! Ok. I will add car rental to my plans. Do you get scared with your dogs, that you will run into wildilfe like that?\nSpeaker A: I think I'm more afraid of the wildlife than my dogs are. If I had to, I think I could muster the courage to face the animals out here, but I will happily avoid them when possible. With you around, I'd feel much better, as well. How do you feel about being that close to wildlife?\nSpeaker B: Well I don't have a lot of experience with that but I guess I'd be ok as long as I knew what to do. Most of the wildlife I see is squirrels, pigeons, and the occasional possum. \nSpeaker A: We have plenty of those out here, as well, and you'll see them far more often than you'll see wolves. We will just have to take extra precautions at night and make sure we don't leave any food outside that might attract them.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is interested in visiting Alaska and mentions getting blackout curtains due to the midnight sun.\nSpeaker B found flights that work for their schedule and price and will be visiting Speaker A in a couple of weeks.\nSpeaker B is planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\nSpeaker A suggests going on hikes in Alaska to see wildlife and mentions glaciers as a potential attraction.\nSpeaker A mentioned the wildlife, including elk and wolves.\nSpeaker B is interested in going whale watching and asks about a wolf petting zoo.\nSpeaker A mentions the \"midnight sun\" phenomenon in Alaska where the sun does not set during the summer.\nSpeaker A mentioned making poached eggs for breakfast and taking sleds pulled by dogs.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a plan. I'll make sure to keep that in mind to stay safe. I'm excited to experience the wildlife in Alaska, especially with your guidance.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several relevant pieces of information that could help Speaker B in planning the visit, such as interests in concerts, outdoor activities, and wildlife in Alaska. However, while some elements connect well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, other details lack clear causality or relevance to a natural continuation of the conversation. For instance, the MEMORY mentions a wolf petting zoo, which might be relevant, but this idea wasn't discussed in the current dialogue. Furthermore, the notion of sleds pulled by dogs and poached eggs breakfast doesn't directly connect with the current dialogue's topics and might be less essential for generating the next response. However, the memory does cover the broader context of the trip well, such as the interest in the midnight sun, the idea of getting blackout curtains, and planning around concert dates. These elements can facilitate Speaker B's next response as they align with the ongoing discussion about planning the visit."
