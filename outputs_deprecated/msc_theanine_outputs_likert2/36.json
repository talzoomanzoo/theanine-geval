Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country, while Speaker B is from Sweden and mentioned playing tennis and going to church on Sunday. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip, causing Speaker B to recommend checking out the volcanoes in Sweden for a unique experience.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker A has a cousin in Sweden, which corroborates the dialogue context where Speaker A talks about planning a trip to Sweden with the help of their cousin. It also notes that Speaker A needs to save money for the trip, which is relevant for planning a trip. However, the suggestion of checking out the volcanoes in Sweden is not very helpful for generating a next response since Sweden is not known for having volcanoes, and there is no mention of volcanoes in the dialogue context. Additionally, the fact that Speaker B plays tennis and goes to church on Sunday does not seem to naturally connect or contribute to the context of planning or discussing the trip. Thus, while there are some helpful elements, the lack of cohesion and some irrelevant details limit the overall helpfulness."
