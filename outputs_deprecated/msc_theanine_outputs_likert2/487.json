Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for.\nSpeaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A, a recent high school graduate on a cross-country journey looking for jobs, wants to potentially visit the Columbia Trail and Ken Lockwood Gorge for a camping and hiking trip. In addition, Speaker A plans to leave a hammock by the river for anyone to use at a hidden spot off the main hiking trail. This plan changed as Speaker A now has a portable hammock for the hike and asks if Speaker B will bring theirs.\n\nSpeaker B, who does not vote, wants their neighbor John to know about their stance on group equality. This desire is caused by the fact that Speaker B's neighbor, John, is getting divorced and selling top-of-the-line camping gear. Additionally, Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I applied for a cashier position at the grocery store. It's a start, but I'm hoping to save up for more hiking and camping gear for future trips.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some context about Speaker A's background and future plans, such as being a recent high school graduate and considering camping trips. Additionally, it gives information about Speaker A's relation to outdoor activities, like carrying a hammock for hikes. However, this information is loosely connected to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is primarily concerned with Speaker A receiving a job offer from a grocery store.\n\nThe MEMORY also contains information about Speaker B, including their opinions and personal connections, which have little relevance or direct connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The mention of Speaker B's friend working at the store is somewhat relevant but lacks detail on how it impacts the current conversation.\n\nOverall, while the MEMORY contains some potentially useful background information, it is not naturally connected or causally linked to the immediate context concerning the job offer. More coherence and relevancy are needed for it to be rated higher on helpfulness for generating the next response."
