Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \n\nMEMORY:\n- Speaker A, a runner who dislikes traveling but has visited 20 countries, wants to improve their mile time and train for a marathon. This causes Speaker A to seek advice on marathon training and recovery. As a result, Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and scheduling a beach meeting at 0600.\n\n- Speaker B, who travels frequently for work and misses their wife and kids, wants to work on improving their mile time and train for a marathon like Speaker A. This causes Speaker A to seek advice on marathon training and recovery. Speaker B is considering running a marathon and has mentioned fishing and feeling depressed, which is a similar topic to Speaker A's marathon training.\n\n- Speaker A, a runner who dislikes traveling but has visited 20 countries, wants Speaker B to get into motivational speaking. This change occurred after Speaker B ran a marathon and found it tough but rewarding. Speaker B got into motivational speaking as a way to battle depression and anxiety, a topic they joked about while mentioning fishing and feeling depressed.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that can be useful for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker A is interested in running, marathons, and motivational speaking, which aligns with their request for a motivational speaker to help motivate a friend to run again. Additionally, it notes that Speaker B has an interest in running marathons and motivational speaking as a way to combat depression and anxiety. This shows a connection between their past interactions involving marathon training and motivational speaking, which could be used to respond to Speaker A's query.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY contains some redundancy and extraneous details such as Speaker A's travel history and Speaker B's missing of their family, which are not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Furthermore, some sentences in the MEMORY appear repetitious and don't clearly establish causality or development in their relationship. This limits the overall helpfulness of the MEMORY for generating a focused and relevant response.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY is partially helpful but could benefit from more coherence and focus on the relevant aspects of motivational speaking and marathon training related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
