Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play? \nSpeaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music.\nSpeaker A: ah right, who's your favourite rock band?\nSpeaker B: I'm big fan of aerosmith. When do you learn music.

Still I didn't get right teacher. I'm jealous on you. I don't have like your dad.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is in a band where they play the drums and write music, with 4 members including the singer who is their best friend. Speaker A is in a band and plays music, possibly a musician. Speaker A's band visited Italy, Uzbekistan, and smaller countries in Central and South America. \nSpeaker B was good at writing in school, while Speaker B was bad at math and preferred fishing.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some background about Speaker A and B, but only a small portion of it is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The fact that Speaker A is in a band and plays the drums is connected to the conversation, as Speaker A mentioned playing the drums since childhood. However, details such as band visits to various countries and information about Speaker B's school experiences and hobbies (fishing and surfing) do not contribute to extending the current dialogue about musical interests and capabilities. The MEMORY lacks logical progression or causality relating directly to the conversation topic, making it less effective for informing a natural continuation of the current dialogue."
