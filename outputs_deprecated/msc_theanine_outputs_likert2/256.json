Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\nSpeaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\nSpeaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\nSpeaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.\nSpeaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe?\nSpeaker B: There is some weird chemical mix that I really do not mess with.  It is easy to clean up.  I try to stay away from this part of the movies.  I know what it should look like and that we want to keep everyone safe when using the fake blood.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B's father's involvement in producing horror movies influenced Speaker B's favorite genre, leading them to create horror movies with their dad and come up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\nSpeaker B's government job led them to mention taking a nap during work, while Speaker A's passion for producing horror movies makes them want to create movies with Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's smart to prioritize safety on set. It's great that you have a team that takes precautions seriously.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker B's involvement in producing horror movies, which is directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where they discuss their interest in and experiences with horror movies. The mention of Speaker B's father's influence and their collaboration in creating horror movies adds context to Speaker B's background and motivation in this field, which could aid Speaker A in generating a more informed and engaging response. However, some parts of the MEMORY, such as the mention of Speaker B's government job leading to napping during work or Speaker A's passion for producing horror movies, do not directly correlate with the topics discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. These aspects seem somewhat disconnected from the main focus of the conversation, which is the process and experiences related to making horror movies. Additionally, the connections between Speaker B's father's involvement, their genre preference, and their current experiences could be more clearly structured to enhance the overall coherence and relevance."
