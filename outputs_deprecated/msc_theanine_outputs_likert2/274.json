Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her?\nSpeaker B: Hi there, hope you are wlll and managing to save up for your Italy trip?  Thank for asking about the Greek mythology study, we are doing very well. It helps because i am so passionate about it and hope to get to the Greek islands soon\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has been to Italy in the past and enjoyed the food there. This fascinates Speaker A, who is fascinated by the architecture of Italy and enjoys studying history, especially through reading and watching documentaries.\nSpeaker A is planning for a spring break trip and recently bought a dress for Easter. She wants to share her love of Greek mythology with her daughter. Speaker B, on the other hand, does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology. This interest stems from Speaker B's appreciation for superhuman powers and historical events involving such figures.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's wonderful to hear! The Greek islands would be a fantastic destination for exploring your interest in mythology. I'm sure you both would enjoy it.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be helpful in generating a response for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives context about Speaker B's interest in Greek mythology and history, which connects to the ongoing conversation about Speaker B's daughter and Greek mythology. It also notes Speaker A's interest in Greek mythology, which is a relevant detail for understanding the conversation.\n\nHowever, not all pieces of information in the MEMORY are directly related to the current topic of conversation. For instance, details about Speaker A's fascination with Italian architecture and history, or Speaker B's past visit to Italy, are less relevant and do not contribute to the next turn in the dialogue. The MEMORY, while providing some useful background information, contains additional details that do not aid in the direct development of the dialogue about Greek mythology study. Thus, while there are natural connections made within MEMORY, the relevancy to the specific DIALOGUE CONTEXT is moderate, leading to a score of 3."
