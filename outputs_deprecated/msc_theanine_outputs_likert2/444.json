Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast.\nSpeaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project.\nSpeaker A: Quite a few, but it wasn't too crowded. It was a nice change of scenery. What kind of project are you working on?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is a college student who teaches jiu-jitsu, is lactose intolerant, and is enrolled in a class on the history of martial arts while majoring in athletic training. Both Speaker A and Speaker B are interested in martial arts and enjoy learning new things. Speaker A is planning to take summer courses soon and is very active, enjoying martial arts, while Speaker B is busy debugging software and is a runner. Speaker A and Speaker B have not booked any holidays recently.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights relevant personal details about both speakers: Speaker A's interest and involvement in martial arts, including jiu-jitsu and a history class, and Speaker B’s involvement in software debugging. This background aligns with the current discussion about a martial arts class and Speaker B's project. However, while the MEMORY includes shared interests and some potentially relevant context, it lacks direct connection or causality with the current dialogue. The mention of not booking holidays does not add value to the conversation, and more connection between Speaker B’s software work and the project discussed would improve natural flow and relevancy. Thus, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful but could be improved for clarity and direct application to the conversation."
