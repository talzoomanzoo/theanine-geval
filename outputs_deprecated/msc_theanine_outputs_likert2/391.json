Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I was able to get the aluminum sheeting for my garbage. I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. \nSpeaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, who works as a zoo keeper and enjoys it, has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it. Speaker B also considers raccoons intelligent and funny, and believes they can make good pets if cared for properly. Additionally, Speaker B's garbage has a lock to prevent animals from getting into it, especially during windy weather. Speaker B has a dog named Bandicoot and is willing to bring him over for extra company.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm a bit hesitant to befriend them. I'll see how the sheeting works first. By the way, how is Bandicoot adjusting to being at the zoo with you?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT in several ways. It highlights Speaker B's experience with raccoons, indicating that Speaker B is knowledgeable about them and considers them intelligent and capable of being trained. This background supports Speaker B's suggestion to Speaker A about befriending raccoons. Additionally, the MEMORY mentions a dog named Bandicoot who is related to the conversation, aligning with the context where Speaker B talks about Bandicoot's intelligence. The mention of Speaker B's job as a zookeeper adds credibility to their views on raccoons. Overall, the MEMORY is relevant to the context and the information is naturally connected, aiding the generation of a coherent and contextual response. However, there is a small amount of extraneous detail about the garbage lock that isn't directly relevant to the current dialogue context."
