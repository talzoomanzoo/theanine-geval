Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it!\nSpeaker B: I'm glad you liked it. My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to?\nSpeaker A: I recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca. It was super cute and made me want to go visit Italy, but that was too expensive, so instead I booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month. What about you?\nSpeaker B: I have been relaxing with the kids as much as I have. My husband has been busy with work, so we haven't had time for anything big. I would love to visit Italy some day though if we get the chance. Have you ever been to Italy before?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has seen the Disney movie 'Luca' recently, which made them want to go visit Italy, but instead, they booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month.\nSpeaker B's kids enjoy watching Disney movies, which Speaker B also finds good. They all enjoyed watching 'Luca', and her husband loved it too.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY does provide some relevant information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It confirms that Speaker A has recently seen the movie \"Luca\" and was inspired to want to visit Italy, opting for a Hawaii sunset tour instead. This is relevant as it aligns with Speaker A's dialogue about their recent activities and plans. However, the MEMORY inaccurately states, \"They all enjoyed watching 'Luca', and her husband loved it too,\" which did not happen in the current context. This incorrect reference to watching 'Luca' as an activity enjoyed by both families may confuse the language model, as the conversation primarily centers on 'Miracle' and not 'Luca'. While parts of the MEMORY are connected to the CONTEXT, this confusion reduces its helpfulness, pulling it down from a higher score."
