Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play? \nSpeaker B: I don't know play instrument.

    "raw_prediction": "You should definitely give surfing a try, even if your friends aren't interested. It's such a great way to relax and have fun in the water.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker A's surfing interest and daily life desire for escape, which aligns slightly with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT mentioning surfing. However, the majority of the MEMORY consists of information that does not assist in generating a proper next response based on the current dialogue. The fishing and cooking information about Speaker B or Speaker A's writing skills are not connected to the ongoing conversation about music, instruments, and surfing. The piece about Speaker B potentially getting surf lessons is slightly useful but not directly connected to the dialogue's progression. Overall, the MEMORY lacks clear causality or relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, and the events seem disjointed."
