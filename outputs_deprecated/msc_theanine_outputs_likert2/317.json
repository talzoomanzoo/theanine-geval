Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company? Do you build computers or work on programming?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys reading books about ice cream, Disney World, and computers, which causes Speaker A to be open to meeting for lunch and flexible with food choices. Speaker B works for a computer company and is unable to change careers until their child graduates. This makes Speaker B want to speak to their mother, who is a dentist with her own practice. Speaker A, who works for a small local business with a demanding schedule, is hindered by this schedule but remains open to meeting for lunch and flexible with food choices.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information regarding Speaker B, specifically that they work for a computer company, which aligns with the question they ask in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY also contains unrelated information about reading preferences, lunch flexibility, and familial details, which do not directly contribute to the development of the dialogue or help Speaker B generate a relevant response. The details are loosely connected and do not provide a strong causality or relevancy to the conversation at hand, which reduces the overall helpfulness of the MEMORY."
