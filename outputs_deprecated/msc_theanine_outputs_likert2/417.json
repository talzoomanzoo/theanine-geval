Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin!\nSpeaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name? \nSpeaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls! \nSpeaker B: I see what you meant. Plus the color is beautiful orange. I want to see them together, even I am not a cat person they must be cute together at that time. Once the kitten grows up, situation gonna change to me. How are they, they are doing well?\nSpeaker A: Marmalade is orange too but this is better because the baby is sassy and climbs up my leg to sit on my shoulder. I don't understand how you are not a cat person when you have such a large heart for stray kittens.\nSpeaker B: hehe you're right. But i can't explain that why I am not a cat person to you sorry. How's the weather like today, still good weather to have iced tea out there?\n\nMEMORY:\n- Speaker A recently visited a hair salon and now has a kitten from their cat, enjoying taking them on trips. Speaker A used to leave their cats with a friend while traveling, but now they bring the kitten along.\n- Speaker B loves dogs, yet Speaker A and Speaker B have a light-hearted and humorous conversation about their pets and travels. Speaker A used to leave their cats with a friend while traveling, but now they bring the kitten along.\n- Speaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten and mentions having a Mini car, smaller compared to Speaker B's Subaru. Speaker A changed from having a Subaru and a cat named Ginger to considering naming a new kitten Marmalade.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "The weather is perfect for iced tea, not too hot or too cold. I might just enjoy a glass with Pumpkin lounging by my side.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes details about Speaker A's recent kitten, which ties into the conversation about naming the kitten and their affection for their pets. The MEMORY also mentions the humorous dynamic between Speaker A and Speaker B regarding pets, which aligns with the conversational tone in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Furthermore, the note about the Mini car and the change from having a Subaru is relevant as it reflects changes in Speaker Aâ€™s lifestyle, akin to the decision-making nature seen in naming the kitten. However, the repetitiveness in parts of the MEMORY, such as mentioning the friend taking care of the cats while traveling, could be streamlined for improved coherence. Overall, the MEMORY connects well to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but lacks some unique elements or narrative depth that would make it perfectly seamless or more comprehensive."
