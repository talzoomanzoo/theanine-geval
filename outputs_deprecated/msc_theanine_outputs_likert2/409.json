Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read.\nSpeaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting? \nSpeaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far.\nSpeaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes. \nSpeaker A: why don't you like books like that?\nSpeaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading?\nSpeaker A: Not yet.  I think Netflix is going to make it into a movie soon.  They might finally convince me to pay for a subscription haha.\nSpeaker B: Well if it's any good I know you'll be watching the whole thing.\nSpeaker A: you know it.  And I know that you would just fall asleep during it whether it's any good or not.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A's energetic grandchildren have grown old enough to entertain themselves with technology or TV, allowing Speaker A to suggest taking naps during quiet times and mentioning watching her grandkids.\n2. After running out of things to watch, Speaker A, tired from spending time with their energetic grandchildren, turns to Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars.\n3. Speaker A, with 8 grandchildren, finds solace in reading books and watching Netflix, suggesting taking naps during quiet times and mentioning watching her grandkids.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant context regarding Speaker A's time with their grandchildren and their interest in Netflix, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A mentions considering a Netflix subscription. However, the details about the star ratings and the number of grandchildren are not directly connected or necessary to respond to Speaker B's inquiries about the crime drama book. Additionally, the MEMORY does not mention the specific genre interest of Speaker A (crime drama) noted in the dialogue, which could be a relevant piece of information. Overall, the MEMORY somewhat supports the generation of a response, but with room for clearer relevancy and connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
