Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \nSpeaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!).\nSpeaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol\nSpeaker B: I am up for the challenge! I have a few tricks up my sleeve to deal with people like you.\nSpeaker A: Oh geez that makes me sound difficult.lol  Do you have any new speeches coming up?\nSpeaker B: Nope, I just cleared my schedule until the Alps marathon that you're training for. It's just you and me until you break that finish line. I'm going to start sending you a motivational quote every morning at 4 am when I want you to wake up.\nSpeaker A: Wow 4 am.  Is it too late to change my mind?lol\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys fishing and the outdoors, while Speaker B has run a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding. Speaker A is training for marathons and seeking advice on how to recover, and Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600. \nSpeaker A dislikes traveling but has visited 20 countries, and Speaker A is working on improving their mile time and training for a marathon, which causes Speaker A to seek advice on recovery. Speaker A invited Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600. \nSpeaker A dislikes traveling but has visited 20 countries, and Speaker B has run a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding.

    "raw_prediction": "Nope, no turning back now! You're in this for the long run, pun intended. You won't regret it!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A training for marathons and seeking motivational support, which aligns with Speaker B's offer to motivate them during their training for the Alps marathon. Additionally, the fact that Speaker B has run a marathon before and found it rewarding is consistent with their role as a motivational figure. However, there are several redundant statements and repetitions in the MEMORY, and the connections between certain elements (such as fishing and being depressed) and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT are not clearly established. This reduces the overall coherence and helpfulness."
