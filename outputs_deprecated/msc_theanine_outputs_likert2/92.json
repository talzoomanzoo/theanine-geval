Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing?\nSpeaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from?\nSpeaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there.\nSpeaker B: That's great. I have gotten my pets from the shelter and they seem happy I brought them home. I have a hard time saying no to them which is why I have so many pets. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs. Do you have a name in mind for your cat? \nSpeaker A: I've thought of a lot of  names, but in the end it will probably depend on the breed and the sex.  \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals and discovered their love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets. Speaker B thinks pit bulls are lovely and has one that is kind and sweet. Speaker B likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions.\n\nSpeaker B has 5 dogs of different breeds and has rats as pets but didn't include them in the portrait. Speaker B thinks pit bulls are lovely and has one that is kind and sweet. Speaker A is considering getting kittens and thinks rats can be smart.\n\nSpeaker B has 5 dogs of different breeds and has rats as pets but didn't include them in the portrait. Speaker A is interested in getting a dog and likes Akitas. Speaker A prefers adopting pets from shelters rather than from breeders.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "That makes sense, the name can really suit the personality of the cat. I can't wait to see what you choose!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it also contains some repetitive or slightly off-topic details. The MEMORY reveals that Speaker B has a collection of pets and an appreciation for pet paintings, which ties into their plan to paint a portrait featuring their pet rat and great dane. The information that Speaker A prefers adopting shelter animals reinforces their stated intention of visiting a shelter for a new cat. However, some elements, like the specific preference for painting regular people or certain breeds, and repetitive mentions about Speaker B's pit bull, are less directly connected to the ongoing conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY could be better if streamlined to focus more closely on the details that pertain directly to the conversation about getting a new cat and painting portraits."
