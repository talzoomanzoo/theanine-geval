Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys being outside and reading Star Wars novels. Speaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian. Speaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five. Speaker B and their kids are excited about their upcoming trip to Greece. Both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy reading and are librarians.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's fantastic! The Acropolis is an iconic historical site in Athens with breathtaking views. You'll love exploring it.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful context that may help generate a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT: both Speaker A and B are librarians and have a shared interest in reading, which they might connect over. Additionally, Speaker B's excitement about visiting Greece and their admiration for Athena, whom they consider a fitting goddess for a librarian, could be relevant in shaping a response about the Acropolis and its historical and cultural significance. However, some details (such as Speaker B's outdoor preferences or reading habits) are less directly relevant to the specific topic of the Acropolis excursion and don't clearly contribute to generating a more informed or contextual response. There may be a mild indication of relevancy but not a strong or direct connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
