Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A, being an inventor fascinated with teleportation and currently developing a time machine, used to foster puppies but now focuses on caring for dogs and cats at the animal shelter, especially enjoying the arrival of new puppies.\n   \n2. Speaker A's passion for science contrasts with Speaker B's love for music, particularly Black Sabbath, and grilling meat. This has led Speaker B to get involved in volunteering and show a preference for cats, especially kittens, over dogs.\n\n3. Speaker A, an animal lover who adores puppies and frequently visits shelters during their teleportation travels, is now primarily involved in caring for dogs and cats at the shelter, experiencing joy when new puppies arrive.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides background information about Speaker A and Speaker B's interests and activities, which helps to understand the context of their conversation. Both Speakers are involved with animal shelters, and this context helps to understand Speaker A's comparison between the cuteness of cats and puppies in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Moreover, the memory provides overlapping information which reiterates their roles and preferences. However, the focus on teleportation and time machine, as well as the contrasting passion for music and grilling, seems less relevant to the immediate context of the new cat at the shelter. The sentences describing their activities are structured clearly and naturally connected, which benefits generating a contextually appropriate response but it could be more concise and focused on the central theme of animal care to improve score."
