Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me?\nSpeaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week?\nSpeaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day\nSpeaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A plans to retire down south on a beach for warm weather. Speaker B is interested in visiting Alaska and mentions getting blackout curtains due to the midnight sun. Speaker B found flights that work for their schedule and price and will be visiting Speaker A in a couple of weeks. Speaker A has invited Speaker B to visit them and is excited about the trip. Speaker A plans to take Speaker B on tours and attend folk concerts during the visit.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains helpful information that can aid in generating an appropriate response in the current dialogue context. It reflects the development of Speaker A and B's interactions, such as Speaker B's plan to visit Speaker A. It also provides insights into Speaker Aâ€™s plans for the visit, such as attending concerts. This is relevant to the ongoing discussion about potential concerts. However, the memory could slightly improve by more closely elucidating the connection between past interactions and immediately preceding conversations in the context, such as prior concert discussions. Despite this, the information is mostly naturally connected and relevant to the context at hand."
