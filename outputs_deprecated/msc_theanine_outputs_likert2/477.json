Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \nSpeaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!).\nSpeaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A wants to seek advice on how to recover from marathon training, so Speaker B, who has run a marathon before, offers guidance. Speaker A then invites Speaker B to train together for the Alps marathon. \nSpeaker B, a motivational speaker who travels to give pep talks, joked about combining fishing with feeling depressed. \nSpeaker A, who sprained their ankle while training for marathons, now has a healing ankle injury.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context that could be useful for Speaker B's response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly the detail that Speaker B gives motivational speeches, which aligns with their response expressing enthusiasm about being a motivational speaker. The information about Speaker A's ankle injury and invited Speaker B to train together is somewhat relevant but not directly connected to the current conversation about motivation and dealing with the heat. Additionally, some parts of MEMORY lack a clear connection or flow, like the inclusion of fishing and depression, which do not seem relevant to the current conversation. To be more helpful, the MEMORY could have more directly aligned with the current topic by emphasizing the connection of how Speaker B's motivation could assist Speaker A specifically in dealing with the weather-related lack of motivation."
