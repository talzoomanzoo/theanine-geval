Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\nSpeaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A knowing how to swim since the age of 5 has led to their plan of doing snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination. This has sparked a desire in Speaker A and Speaker B to consider getting on a cruise ship together.\nSpeaker B's enjoyment of cruising in their car while listening to punk music has inspired Speaker A to plan a cruise to the Caribbeans, changing Speaker A's travel plans for their next trip.\nSpeaker A's love for cruising and having a favorite club in school has influenced their decision to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination. This has also fueled a discussion between Speaker A and Speaker B about the possibility of going on a cruise together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is not perfectly aligned or connected. The memory touches on key topics like Speaker A's swimming and their plans for a cruise to the Caribbean, as well as the idea of them going on a cruise together. These topics are relevant and could be useful in formulating a response. However, the descriptions in MEMORY are somewhat repetitive and lack strong logical flow or causal links, leading to an unclear understanding of the events. While they mention activities planned for the cruise and a shared interest in a cruise, the connections between memories and the current dialogue context are not entirely seamless. Therefore, while MEMORY has elements of helpfulness, it lacks a coherent and clear linkage of past events to current discussions, which could enhance the generation of an appropriate next response in the context."
