    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\nSpeaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car?\nSpeaker B: Yes, there are several. Hope we could meet and You possibly teach me about computer programming.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Speaker A offering to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming because Speaker A knows how to swim since the age of 5.\n- Speaker A planning to travel to the Caribbean for their next trip because Speaker B enjoys cruising in their car while listening to punk music.\n- Speaker A planning to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination because Speaker A knows how to swim since the age of 5.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a plan! I can definitely help you with computer programming as well during our meetup this weekend.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides partial but some relevant information for generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memory that Speaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and that they are planning to travel to the Caribbean aligns with the conversation topics in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT regarding swimming lessons and Caribbean travel. However, the mention of Speaker B enjoying cruising in their car while listening to punk music does not seem directly relevant to Speaker A's plan to travel. Additionally, the information about Speaker A planning to do snorkeling is related to swimming but not entirely necessary for the mentioned meetup plans or the conversation flow. While some connections between MEMORY and DIALOGUE CONTEXT are present, coherence and relevance could be improved."
