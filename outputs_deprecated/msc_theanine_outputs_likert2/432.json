Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\nSpeaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout. \nSpeaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat. \nSpeaker B is considering attending a local community college for the first couple of years.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great way for kids to learn important life skills while having fun outdoors. I'll look into signing them up for Boy Scouts.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information but lacks strong relevancy or direct connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The mention of Speaker B's involvement with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years and that they are currently a Life Scout is beneficial as it establishes credibility and experience regarding their knowledge of survival skills, which is relevant to the conversation. However, the mention of Speaker A appreciating Speaker B's involvement and inviting them to a youth retreat, as well as Speaker B considering attending a local community college, does not directly relate to the context of the survival skills discussion. Additionally, while the MEMORY contains relevant background information about Speaker B, it doesn't provide information that directly aids in generating a continuative or responsive dialogue in the current context. The sentences are somewhat connected but lack clear causality or relevance to the primary topic of the dialogue."
