Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country. This has led Speaker A to consider visiting their cousin in Sweden and the need to save money for the trip. As a result, Speaker A and Speaker B are planning to travel to Sweden together. \nSpeaker B, who is from Sweden, mentioned playing tennis and going to church on Sunday. This has sparked Speaker A's consideration of visiting their cousin in Sweden and the need to save money for the trip. Speaker A, having a flexible job, is contemplating taking a second part-time job to save money for travel. \nSpeaker A, who likes playing badminton, has a cousin who recently moved to Sweden. This has resulted in Speaker A considering visiting their cousin in Sweden. Additionally, both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy exploring local music and coffee shops when traveling.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm hoping to visit Sweden again soon, maybe this summer. I miss playing tennis and going to church on Sundays there.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some relevant information, such as Speaker A having a cousin in Sweden and considering visiting them. However, it seems somewhat repetitive and disjointed, mentioning aspects like playing tennis and church that do not directly connect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT or aid in forming a response. The mention of Speaker A's job flexibility and exploring local music and coffee shops also feels out of place given the current context, where the focus is on planning a trip to Sweden and potential sightseeing locations. Overall, while there is some relevant information about Speaker Aâ€™s link to Sweden, the MEMORY could be streamlined and more connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT to be more helpful."
