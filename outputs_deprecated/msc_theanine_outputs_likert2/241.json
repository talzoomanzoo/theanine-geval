Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not!\nSpeaker B: Have you been hiking lately?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys camping and hiking as free activities, which has led to them planning several camping trips for the summer and doing a part of the Appalachian Trail. Speaker A, who works as a personal trainer leading hikes, is nervous about the Appalachian Trail hike as they don't usually do full day hikes. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it, which is similar to Speaker A's love for camping and hiking.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Not lately, but I'm planning a few camping trips for the summer.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that can help Speaker A generate a suitable response in the dialogue. It contains details about Speaker A's interest in hiking and camping, their plans for a summer hiking trip, and their work as a personal trainer leading hikes. This information is directly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A mentions preparing for outdoor activities with mosquito repellent. It also references Speaker B's recent hiking experience, which aligns with the current conversation topic about hiking. The sentences in MEMORY are structured in a way that demonstrates a clear connection and causality between their past interactions and current conversation, making it highly helpful for generating a response."
