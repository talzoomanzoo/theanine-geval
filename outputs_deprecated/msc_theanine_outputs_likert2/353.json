Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: I've been teaching my kids how to make my grandmothers jello recipe, it's time to pass it on!\nSpeaker B: Family traditions are important.  Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar.\nSpeaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general?\nSpeaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts.\nSpeaker A: How's learning to bake going in general, especially now that you're off desserts?\nSpeaker B: I one of those people how have to fail a couple of times before I get the hang of it, but I'm getting there.  Have you and the kids had any chance to go skiing lately?\nSpeaker A: Water skiing? Yes, last weekend. It was so much fun!\nSpeaker B: (sorry my typing sucks)  That's awesome. I wish had access to a boat, but who knows, maybe one day. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B recently quit their job at Cisco to pursue snowboarding. This change has led Speaker B to enjoy snowboarding but will focus on wakeboarding as summer approaches. As a result, Speaker B is excited to join Speaker A's family for a water skiing trip and wants to learn from Speaker A's kids.\n\nSpeaker A has two moms who are not meat eaters. This has caused Speaker A to have a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners. Additionally, Speaker A has a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes.\n\nSpeaker A is eating their favorite jello. Learning how to make jello from their grandma has transformed it into a family tradition for Speaker A. Additionally, Speaker A's grandmother teaches them various jello recipes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Maybe you could start by looking into renting a boat for a day. It could be a fun way to try out water skiing and see if it's something you enjoy!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The memory contains information that has some relevance to the dialogue context, such as the emphasis on family traditions involving jello and the mention of water skiing. However, the memory also introduces disconnected points like Speaker B quitting their job to pursue snowboarding and having aspirations toward wakeboarding, which are not directly relevant to the current dialogue about jello, baking, or skiing. Additionally, while there are repeated mentions of Speaker A's connection to jello through their grandmother, which moderately aligns with the context, the memory fails to clearly connect these details with the ongoing dialogue or provide a contextual causality/relevancy that would aid in generating the next response. The presence of extraneous details and lack of seamless connection reduces the helpfulness of the memory."
