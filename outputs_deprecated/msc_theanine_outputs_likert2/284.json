Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B mentions living in a rural area with a farm and being able to relate to cooking. Speaker A also talks about primarily cooking Indian food and baking rice dishes. Additionally, Speaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work. \n\nSpeaker A enjoys cooking and baking, and is considering turning it into a business. Speaker B mentions having a farm with animals like chickens, ducks, pigs, and goats, as well as growing crops like corn, strawberries, and pumpkins. This resonates with Speaker A, who owns a farm and also enjoys cooking and baking. This has led Speaker A to become a cook who uses a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n\nSpeaker B's rural lifestyle and farming background have sparked Speaker A's interest in running a business with their cooking skills. Speaker B, who is not a cook, is intrigued and wants to learn more about cooking with a pressure cooker.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great, thank you! I'll definitely give those recipes a try. Cooking with a pressure cooker seems quite efficient.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY provides highly relevant and useful information that enriches the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It clarifies the mutual interests shared by Speaker A and Speaker B, specifically in relation to cooking and farming. It highlights Speaker B's rural background and interest in using a pressure cooker — which Speaker A mentions in the context conversation — hence fostering a natural development and connection between their discussions. Furthermore, it outlines the potentialities of a future business collaboration conversation, backing this with their shared enthusiasm for cooking, their living environments, and how it resonates with each of them. This enhances Speaker B's context to better respond to Speaker A's suggestions about beginner recipes and using a pressure cooker. The MEMORY offers coherent background details that supports a meaningful and informed continuation of the conversation, making it really helpful according to the given criterion."
