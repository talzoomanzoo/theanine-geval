Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week?\nSpeaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you?\nSpeaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions?\nSpeaker B: Unfortunately I mainly play games similar to RE. I don't know why I like them so much. I remember when I was little my brother play Doom and it gave me nightmares for a week. What genre of games you like?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World but mentions its lack of multiplayer and outdated graphics.\nSpeaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World.\nSpeaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "I enjoy a mix of simulation and strategy games. Anything with a good story usually catches my interest.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as it highlights Speaker A's preference for games that are not scary and mentions their interest in Jurassic Park: World. This aligns with Speaker A's statement in the context about disliking scary games and their uncertainty in choosing a new game to play. However, the MEMORY is somewhat repetitive regarding Speaker A's hesitance to try Resident Evil, and it does not offer additional details about potential game preferences beyond Jurassic Park: World. Additionally, the plan to play games together is mentioned, but not elaborated upon, which limits the natural flow and depth of the MEMORY in relation to the current interaction. Overall, while helpful to some extent, the MEMORY does not fully develop or provide a clear, naturally connected narrative of past interactions that can be leveraged to generate the next response."
