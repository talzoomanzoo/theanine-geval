Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: We watched Miracle at the weekend like you suggested, we all really enjoyed it!\nSpeaker B: I'm glad you liked it. My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to?\nSpeaker A: I recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca. It was super cute and made me want to go visit Italy, but that was too expensive, so instead I booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month. What about you?\nSpeaker B: I have been relaxing with the kids as much as I have. My husband has been busy with work, so we haven't had time for anything big. I would love to visit Italy some day though if we get the chance. Have you ever been to Italy before?\nSpeaker A: I have never gone to Italy because I'm always so busy. If I ever go, I would want to spend a month there, but work has been hectic lately. Would your kids go with you if you went to Italy?\nSpeaker B: Absolutely! I'd love to travel all over the world with my family to see everything. Hawaii sounds like just as much fun though. What are you most excited about doing when you get there?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A recently watched the Disney movie 'Luca' and found it super cute, which made them want to visit Italy.\nSpeaker B used to enjoy watching movies with her kids, but now prefers romance and horror movies. However, their kids really enjoyed watching 'Luca' and thought it was good.\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both enjoy sunsets and movies, with Speaker A preferring the beach for watching sunsets. Speaker A has booked a \"Hawaii Sunset\" tour for next month and is excited about it being their first time.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm most excited about watching the beautiful sunsets on the beach in Hawaii. It's going to be a magical experience.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a lot of relevant information that can aid in generating a proper response in the dialogue context. It clearly mentions that Speaker A recently watched the Disney movie 'Luca,' which aligns with the dialogue where they talk about wanting to visit Italy. The MEMORY also accurately reflects Speaker A's excitement about booking a \"Hawaii Sunset\" tour, which is pertinent to the discussion about travel. Furthermore, it captures the shared interest between Speaker A and Speaker B in movies and sunsets, which can be used to generate a conversational response.\n\nHowever, there is some minor information in the MEMORY that is not directly mentioned in the dialogue context, such as Speaker B's preference for romance and horror movies, which might not be immediately relevant to the current flow of conversation. Despite this, the MEMORY still contains helpful and naturally connected information that demonstrates the relevancy and potential development of the speakers' past interactions."
