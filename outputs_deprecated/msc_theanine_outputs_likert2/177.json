Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know. \nSpeaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys going to bars and loves the ladies. They also like Mexican food and women. \nSpeaker B's wife is pregnant and currently in the second trimester, still working. They are considering attending a local festival for just a day. \nSpeaker A is not sure if they will ever settle down with a partner and have kids. \nSpeaker B, a mechanic, is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy. They discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Sounds like a plan! I'll talk to my friend about it and let you know the details.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker Bâ€™s wife is pregnant and currently in the second trimester, which aligns with the offer of a more comfortable stay at a cabin for the festival, indicating consideration for her comfort. It also clarifies that Speaker B is considering attending a local festival, which connects to the dialogue's topic about a Bluegrass show and the logistics around it. Furthermore, the MEMORY information about Speaker B's jealousy relates to the potential tension in considering such activities. However, some parts of the MEMORY, such as Speaker A's personal preferences and thoughts on settling down, do not directly contribute to generating a helpful response in the current conversation context. Overall, the MEMORY is quite helpful but not perfectly aligned throughout."
