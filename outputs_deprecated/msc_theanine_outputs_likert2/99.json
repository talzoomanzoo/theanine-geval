Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is going to Alaska for a vacation in two weeks and has some experience with flying on airplanes. Speaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together. Speaker A and Speaker B share a sense of humor and make each other laugh during the conversation. Speaker B is unsure about what else there is to do in Alaska besides hiking. Speaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet. Speaker B mentions that southern Alaska has warmer temperatures in the summer.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information to help generate a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about the Alaskan trip. It highlights that Speaker B is planning a vacation to Alaska and is unsure about activities aside from hiking, which is directly related to Speaker A's question about trip ideas. However, the details are somewhat basic and scattered, with some information not directly contributing to generating a new, insightful response. For instance, references to Speaker A's knowledge of Alaska do not contribute directly but could be useful if further integrated into a more focused narrative. Additionally, humorous interactions are mentioned, but not in a way that directly ties into planning the trip. Overall, the information is partially helpful but lacks a clear connection or development narrative to make it highly beneficial."
