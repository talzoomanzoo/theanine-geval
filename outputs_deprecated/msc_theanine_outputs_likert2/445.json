Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast.\nSpeaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project.\nSpeaker A: Quite a few, but it wasn't too crowded. It was a nice change of scenery. What kind of project are you working on?\nSpeaker B: I'm sure the student appreciate that. You teach as a group as apposed to one-on-one right? And one of the companies I work for had their system hit with a virus so I've been upgraded their software to debug the system.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is planning to take summer courses soon and is very active, enjoying martial arts. Speaker A is enrolled in a class on the history of martial arts and is majoring in athletic training. Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class and enjoys it. Speaker B is involved in software work and recently signed up for an online class about the history of martial arts.\nSpeaker A is a college student who teaches jiu-jitsu and is lactose intolerant. Speaker A is taking a history of martial arts class and enjoys it. Both Speaker A and Speaker B are interested in martial arts and enjoy learning new things.\nSpeaker A is planning to take summer courses soon and is very active, enjoying martial arts. Speaker A has never been out of the United States and thinks it would be nice to visit England. Speaker A and Speaker B have not booked any holidays recently.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Teaching in a group setting allows for more interaction among students. Upgrading software can be time-consuming, but it's rewarding once everything runs smoothly.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information regarding Speaker A and B's interests, particularly in martial arts, which aligns with the Dialogue Context. However, it lacks strong connections or causality between sentences that could truly enhance the language model's ability to generate a responsive reply in the context. There is redundancy in the information about Speaker A's enjoyment and education in martial arts, without expanding on how these interests intersect with the current conversation about martial arts classes and software debugging. Additionally, there is a mention of Speaker B's involvement in software work but no direct connection to the specific project they're working on, which would have been more helpful. Overall, while there are some useful tidbits, the memory does not fully capitalize on its potential to provide a detailed backdrop for the current dialogue scenario."
