Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\nSpeaker B: How is the trip to Sweden going anyways?\nSpeaker A: I am still in the planning stages, since my cousin lives over there, she is helping me to plan it. Any must sees while I am there?\nSpeaker B: It really depends! Personally, I love the castles! Visby is probably my favorite spot. \nSpeaker A: Okay, I will see if there are any castles near where we will be. Do you have any plans to go back to sweden?\nSpeaker B: Not in the near future, but I'm hoping to get back next summer. I love hitting up all the local beach spots with my old friends.\nSpeaker A: That sounds nice! So how is your job going?\nSpeaker B: Always interesting, that's for sure! I have been training to nurse on a new floor, so that'll give me a change of scenery.\nSpeaker A: Does that add a lot of extra work to your plate?\nSpeaker B: At the moment, yes. I'll be in Pediatrics, which has always been my passion. It's a completely different environment than the ER.\nSpeaker A: Oh wow! That is so exciting for you. Will you get to stay in pediatrics after the training is complete?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a cousin in Sweden but has not visited the country. Speaker B has not visited Sweden for a long time due to the high expenses. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together. Speaker B is from Sweden and mentioned playing tennis and going to church on Sunday. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant details such as Speaker A having a cousin in Sweden and the idea of planning a trip. However, there are inaccuracies and repetitions within the MEMORY that detract from its helpfulness. For instance, it repeats that Speaker A and Speaker B plan to travel to Sweden together, which is not aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where no such plan is discussed. Additionally, Speaker B's background information, such as being from Sweden and tennis mention, are not referred to in the dialogue, making the information less relevant. These inconsistencies and lack of coherence with the dialogue context lower the score, as they could hinder generating a natural and connected next response."
