Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company?

How long have you worked for your company?\nSpeaker B: For about four years. It's an industry in flux which is stressful. I need stability for my family at this point. It has changed my focus, which I'm not used to yet. Are you considering any other options for work?\nSpeaker A: Yes I am considering going back to school for dentistry. I am trying to get grants for the money I need. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A's father was in the military, and Speaker B's mother is a dentist.

    "raw_prediction": "That's a big decision. Dentistry is a great field. Have you always been interested in teeth?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant background information about Speaker A and their career considerations, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A mentions going back to school for dentistry. It elaborates on the reasons behind Speaker A considering dentistry and their age, which can influence future dialogue. Additionally, it mentions Speaker A's interest in Disney and Speaker B's enjoyment of Disney World, providing a personal connection that may be explored in the conversation. While the MEMORY contains useful details, some sentences are somewhat repetitive regarding Speaker A's career decisions. Overall, it offers relevant context that can be leveraged for a more informed response by Speaker B."
