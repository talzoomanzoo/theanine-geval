Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing?\nSpeaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha!\nSpeaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes?\nSpeaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe. \nSpeaker A: You make them sounds so fascinating. Will you take them with you to your college dorm? \nSpeaker B: I'll be living off campus, so absolutely. How about you? Are you staying in the dorms?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is interested in scuba diving because Speaker B loves to scuba dive in Hawaii when not working. This interest is further fueled by Speaker A's friend who is a professional scuba diver and plans to go diving with them. Speaker A also plans to work with humans in neuroscience to help cure neurological diseases, and once Speaker B finishes their studies, Speaker A intends to compare humans and animals.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nThe MEMORY provided does not have any direct or relevant connection to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on Speaker B's pet snakes and living arrangements for college. The MEMORY discusses scuba diving, neuroscience, and curing neurological diseases, which are unrelated topics and offer no useful information for generating a response to the current dialogue. Additionally, there is no indication of how these memories are causally or contextually linked to the ongoing conversation."
