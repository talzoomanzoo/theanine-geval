Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is involved in horse breeding and taking care of horses, which has caused Speaker B to work in their own therapy practice for about six years. \nSpeaker B, a therapist and football fan supporting the Chiefs, mentions the ups and downs of the profession, and wants to live in the city and have a horse in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I've always been interested in helping others and psychology, so becoming a therapist felt like a natural fit for me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some background information about Speaker B, such as their profession as a therapist and their interest in horse ownership and football. However, it lacks a clear connection or causality between Speaker A's question about becoming a therapist and the information provided. The MEMORY does not offer much insight into why Speaker B decided to become a therapist, which is the topic of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The details mentioned in the MEMORY are not directly relevant to the question posed and do not help generate a well-informed response. The information is somewhat disjointed and does not demonstrate a clear development or relevance to past interactions between the speakers."
