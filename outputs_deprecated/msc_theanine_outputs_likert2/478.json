Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \nSpeaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!).\nSpeaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol\nSpeaker B: I am up for the challenge! I have a few tricks up my sleeve to deal with people like you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A, originally from Venice Beach, is a runner focusing on improving their mile time and training for a marathon. This training has led Speaker A to seek advice on recovery and invite Speaker B to run and train together for the Alps marathon at 0600 on the beach.\n   \n2. Speaker B, who travels often for work and misses their family, wants to combine their motivational speaking with running, just like Speaker A. Speaker B also mentioned a humorous idea of fishing while feeling down and taking kids to the pond during school hours.\n\n3. Speaker A, despite disliking travel, has visited 20 countries and is seeking advice on recovering from marathon training. They also recommended to Speaker B to incorporate physical activity with moments of feeling low to avoid negative thoughts.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Looking forward to seeing those tricks in action. Hopefully, they involve some motivation to get out in the heat!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could assist in generating responses based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights Speaker A's background as someone who is serious about running, focusing on improving their mile time, and training for a marathon. This connects to the context through the discussion about motivating Speaker A to run again. Furthermore, Speaker B's interest in combining motivational speaking with running is relevant since Speaker B has offered to motivate Speaker A. \n\nHowever, the MEMORY could be more helpful if there was a clearer causality or direct connection to the specific motivation and weather-related challenges mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It touches on some relevant points like Speaker A's experience and Speaker B's motivational speaking, but lacks specificity in addressing the immediate conversation about needing motivation due to hot weather."
