Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin!\nSpeaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name? \nSpeaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls! \nSpeaker B: I see what you meant. Plus the color is beautiful orange. I want to see them together, even I am not a cat person they must be cute together at that time. Once the kitten grows up, situation gonna change to me. How are they, they are doing well?\nSpeaker A: Marmalade is orange too but this is better because the baby is sassy and climbs up my leg to sit on my shoulder. I don't understand how you are not a cat person when you have such a large heart for stray kittens.\nSpeaker B: hehe you're right. But i can't explain that why I am not a cat person to you sorry. How's the weather like today, still good weather to have iced tea out there?\nSpeaker A: It's beautiful. I'm sitting outside while the Spice Girls are chasing bugs in the grass. What did your kids name your cats?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A recently visited a hair salon and drives a Mini Cooper. They also have a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, but now considering naming a new kitten Pumpkin. Speaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten and enjoys taking them on trips. Speaker B went on a trip to San Diego with kids and struggled with parking for the Subaru.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "They named them Luna and Milo. They are totally different characters but they get along well most of the time.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly around the context of naming the new kitten and the existing cat named Ginger. These elements are directly connected to the current conversation about the kittens and their names. However, the information about Speaker A visiting a hair salon, driving a Mini Cooper and a Subaru, and Speaker B's trip to San Diego do not directly contribute to any themes or topics present in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While these details are a part of the speakersâ€™ backgrounds, they do not help Speaker B to formulate a response that connects to the conversation about the cats, their names, characteristics, or activities. Therefore, the relevancy and connectivity could be improved to warrant a higher score."
