Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college?\nSpeaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket while majoring in Humanities, but now plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week. They are a member of a soccer team and enjoy playing in tournaments. \nSpeaker A enjoys playing soccer but is not into music, and as a result, they are a fan of Arsenal and enjoy watching international teams play. \nSpeaker A enjoys playing soccer but is not into music, and as a result, joked about treating Speaker B to lunch, indicating Speaker B is currently low on cash. Speaker B is considering asking for a raise at work and works as a clerk for a law firm. They enjoy the work but wish it paid better.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information about Speaker A's current soccer-related activities and interests, which can be contextually relevant to the ongoing dialogue about soccer. Speaker A's position as a striker and their enthusiasm for soccer tournaments and teams can offer direction for responses focusing on soccer-related topics. However, there is an overlap and redundancy in the description concerning Speaker A's dislike for music, which is repeated twice without adding value to the context. There is also a lack of clarity or direct connection between some of the MEMORY content (such as Speaker B's work situation or considering the raise) and the current dialogue about soccer. As a result, while there is valuable information that could be used by the language model, the memory could benefit from more clear and directly relevant connections to the ongoing conversation."
