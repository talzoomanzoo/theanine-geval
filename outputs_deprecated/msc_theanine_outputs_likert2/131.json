Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well?\nSpeaker B: I haven't! Just karate! Have you been thinking of taking some classes?\nSpeaker A: I want to take some martial art classes at school next year. What do you sggest I try?\nSpeaker B: I mean I always recommend Karate since that's what I study! I can bring you by the dojo sometime if you want to see what it is like. \nSpeaker A: OMG!! That would be so awesome, Yes please.  When is a good time for you?\nSpeaker B: Awesome! Tomorrow afternoon anytime between 3-6 would work for me!\nSpeaker A: Perfect. I will meet you at the Dojo at 3pm. I really appriciate it, and I will buy you lunch after too. \nSpeaker B: That's great! I can bring some guest passes to the pool I lifeguard at as well! I'm working this weekend if you want to come when I am working. Where do you want to eat?\nSpeaker A: I defiantly will. As well a bucket of sunscreen, safety in the sun first.  I was thinking that new sandwhich shop by the collage that just opened, what do nyou think? \nSpeaker B: Oh yeah gotta bring that SPF 100! The new deli sounds great. I have been craving cold cuts! \nSpeaker A: I personally use SPF Vampire HAHA! Fantastic. Yeah they have this Italian sub im dying to try.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, who used to be the captain of a football team and is currently a lifeguard, has transitioned to signing up for classes at the local college. They have a background in football and karate, and now they are considering a career change to the IT sector due to their computer skills and the demand for employees in that field. Speaker B also practices karate and holds a green belt, while attending football games at their old high school and finding that their football background helps in karate footwork.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several pieces of information about Speaker B that could be helpful in generating a response. It tells us that Speaker B has a background in football and karate and is currently a lifeguard, which is relevant since they mentioned working as a lifeguard during the weekend in the dialogue. The detail about Speaker B's potential career change to the IT sector and their computer skills is somewhat extraneous given the context, but it could be useful if the conversation moves towards discussing career aspirations. The information about Speaker B's karate background, including their green belt status, could be relevant to continue the conversation about karate classes. However, not all the sentences in the MEMORY demonstrate a clear and direct connection to the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT or are necessary for generating a focused response. Thus, the score reflects the balance between relevant and less relevant information."
