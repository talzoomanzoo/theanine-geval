Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A and Speaker B both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot, hoping to change their luck.\n2. Speaker A bought 50 lotto tickets with different numbers to increase their chances of winning, despite Speaker B's belief that luxurious items distract from the value of their family.\n3. Speaker B leads a hectic life but is interested in attending the concert with their kids during winter break, even though they believe that luxurious items distract from the value of their family. This interest may have been influenced by Speaker B's children being sick and Speaker B having a fever, leading them to buy 20 lotto tickets.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY does not directly relate to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A has bought an expensive new iPhone. The memory provides background on both speakers buying lotto tickets, with details about their beliefs on luxury items and some mention of Speaker B's hectic life and desire to attend a concert. However, these details do not offer direct causality or relevance to Speaker A's recent purchase of an expensive item. The connection between the new phone and the memory is tenuous at best. While the MEMORY has some coherence in the narrative about speakers' past lottery activities, it doesn't clearly aid in generating a response to the iPhone purchase scenario. The helpfulness is limited as it lacks a clear link to the current dialogue."
