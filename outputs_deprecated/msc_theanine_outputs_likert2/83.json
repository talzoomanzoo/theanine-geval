Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\nSpeaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call!\nSpeaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip? \nSpeaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery\nSpeaker B: Yes I think that's a great idea, how is work at the library? \nSpeaker A: Busy, and demanding because we are short staffed. While there seems to be little need for a library these days, I find that we have less staff to get everything done\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has a lot of kids, all grown up now and with kids of their own, which is why Speaker B mentions having grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park. This causes Speaker B to like the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature. \n\nSpeaker A is a librarian and loves kids, mentioning having 3 children. As a result, Speaker A is busy with work and unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. This also leads to Speaker A's other children being addicted to tablets and phones, unlike the youngest one who is interested in music.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information for generating a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It clarifies that Speaker B has a large family with grown-up children and grandchildren, explaining Speaker B's fondness for spending time with them and the motivation for wanting to start an annual fishing trip. This directly relates to the discussion in the dialogue about spending time with grandkids and planning the fishing trip. \n\nAdditionally, the MEMORY states that Speaker A is a librarian who loves kids, has three children, and is busy at work, which affects the time spent with their children and the children's use of technology. This complements the context provided when Speaker A mentions their busy work life and difficulty in keeping in touch with family through phone calls, enriching the ongoing dialogue about work demands and family interactions.\n\nHowever, the mention of Speaker A's children's technology habits is not directly connected to the current dialogue context but rather serves as background information. The MEMORY structure is mostly coherent, with relevant information, though it could be slightly more concise. Overall, the MEMORY successfully aids the generation of contextually appropriate responses."
