Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not!\nSpeaker B: Have you been hiking lately?\nSpeaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me.\nSpeaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway?\nSpeaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day! I'll make it as fun as possible.\nSpeaker B: I will someday. just not in the summer when all the bugs are out! Where do you go hiking the most?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it, causing Speaker A to be nervous about the Appalachian Trail hike, as they don't usually do full day hikes.\nSpeaker A has never been on a cruise, but may consider trying one in the future. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking as free activities, and also enjoys camping trips while looking for wild animals in the woods. Speaker B, on the other hand, dislikes bugs and is not a fan of camping, hiking, or the outdoors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I usually go hiking in the state parks nearby. There are some great trails with beautiful views.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker A's interest in hiking and camping, which is helpful given the dialogue context where hiking and outdoor activities are being discussed. The details about Speaker B's dislike for bugs and the outdoors also align with the context where Speaker B mentions not being a fan of hiking. However, the MEMORY includes information that is not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, like Speaker A's consideration of trying a cruise or being nervous about the Appalachian Trail hike, which doesn't add to the current interaction. Additionally, the MEMORY lacks a directly connected causality or progression between the past interactions mentioned and the current dialogue context, making it somewhat disconnected. Therefore, while there are relevant details, the MEMORY could be more focused and cohesive to fully support the dialogue generation."
