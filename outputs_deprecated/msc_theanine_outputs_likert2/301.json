Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome.

    "raw_prediction": "I do enjoy sushi, but I haven't tried sea urchin yet. Maybe I'll have to be adventurous like you and give it a shot!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some potentially relevant information such as Speaker B's preference for local holidays with their brother, and the fact that Speaker B enjoys Brazilian food and houseboat activities. However, the MEMORY largely consists of disparate pieces of information without clear connections or causality to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It does not provide any specific details that directly relate to the conversation about the Black Widow movie, Avengers, or the specific Brazilian food Speaker A mentioned they enjoyed. Therefore, the MEMORY's helpfulness in assisting Speaker B in generating the next response is limited."
