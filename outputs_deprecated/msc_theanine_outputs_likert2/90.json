Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing?\nSpeaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from?\nSpeaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A wants a family portrait from Speaker B, who is an artist, did a painting for Elton John, and has student debt from art school. Speaker B is currently working on a portrait for Speaker A and also working on other portraits while taking care of a sick dog.\n\n2. Speaker B's prices for a portrait have changed to starting at $5000 to pay for college tuition. Speaker B prefers painting regular people over professionals, discovered love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets, thinks pit bulls are lovely, and has a kind and sweet pit bull. Speaker B also likes Persian cats and imagines their pets having interesting interactions. Speaker A is considering getting kittens and thinks rats can be smart.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's wonderful! Shelter cats are the best. I can't wait to see which one you choose for your family portrait.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that can assist in generating an appropriate response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It effectively mentions Speaker A's and Speaker B's interests and activities concerning pets, art, and potential interactions with pets, which are directly linked to the ongoing conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Speaker A's plans to get a new cat from a shelter align well with Speaker B's interest in pets. Furthermore, the details about Speaker B's preferences for painting pets, the prices, and the connection with a painting for Elton John can serve as additional background information to build natural and engaging responses. However, some parts of Memory might not be directly essential to the conversation, giving it a slight disconnect and preventing a perfect score."
