Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing?\nSpeaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha!\nSpeaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B recently divorced their wife and loves to scuba dive in Hawaii when not working. Speaker A does not have any pets and expresses an interest in scuba diving. Speaker B has an interest in diving and is planning to take neuroscience classes using the GI Bill. Speaker B is a veteran who went to the army after high school, interested in neuroscience and seeking advice on studying it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided gives background information about Speaker B, such as their recent divorce, interest in scuba diving, plans to study neuroscience using the GI Bill, and their status as a veteran. While this context might help in general character understanding, it does not directly relate to the dialogue context, which is focused on Speaker B's pet snakes, Hensel and Gretel. The MEMORY contains multiple pieces of information, but there is little to no direct connection between these past interactions or interests and the current conversation topic about pets, making it not very helpful for generating a proper next response in the given dialogue context. The memory doesn't provide information relevant to the dialogue's current focus, nor does it offer insights that would naturally guide or enhance the continuation of the conversation."
