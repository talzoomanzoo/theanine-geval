    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\nSpeaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach?\nSpeaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option.\nSpeaker A: Yes I think history is interesting, too! Both of those subjects would be great because there are probably lots of teaching jobs. What kind of history do you like?\nSpeaker B: I love all sorts of history. Right now I am really getting into the weeds of World War II. There's so much to unpack.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, majoring in linguistics and aspiring to turn it into a practical job, causes Speaker A to be interested in teaching computer science, particularly in the field of robotics.\nSpeaker B, living with their mom and currently in college, wants to pursue a masters degree after finishing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. This leads Speaker B to feel limited in job opportunities but also sparks an interest in studying linguistics.\nSpeaker B, majoring in linguistics and hoping to turn it into a practical job, wants Speaker A, who is studying computer science and aims to develop apps for differently abled youth, to be interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "World War II is such a fascinating period to study. The impact it had on the world is immense. Have you considered specializing in a particular aspect of history for your teaching career?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's major in linguistics and interest in turning it into a practical job, which aligns with their consideration of teaching as a stable career. However, much of the MEMORY is repetitive, lacks clear causality and relevancy to the ongoing conversation, and some details, such as Speaker A's intention to develop apps for differently abled youth, are not directly connected to the main topic of teaching. The MEMORY does not significantly expand on the development of the dialogue or provide insights that would aid in generating a targeted response in the context presented."
