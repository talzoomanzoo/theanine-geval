Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the speech go? Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \nSpeaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!).\nSpeaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol\nSpeaker B: I am up for the challenge! I have a few tricks up my sleeve to deal with people like you.\nSpeaker A: Oh geez that makes me sound difficult.lol  Do you have any new speeches coming up?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, originally from San Francisco, enjoys fishing and the outdoors, and has experience running a marathon which they found tough but rewarding. Speaker A, on the other hand, is from Venice Beach, is a dedicated runner working on improving their mile time and training for a marathon. Speaker B, known as a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks, joked about combining fishing with feeling depressed. Additionally, Speaker B's job involves motivating people to be successful and follow their dreams, which was inspired by their past marathon experience.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I do actually! I have a big conference next month where I'll be speaking about overcoming obstacles and achieving your goals. It's going to be powerful, I can't wait.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about Speaker B's role as a motivational speaker, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B considers motivating Speaker A and their friend. The mention of Speaker B's motivational speaking job and their past marathon experience ties back to their ability to inspire others, which is pertinent to the conversation. However, the MEMORY also includes information that doesn't directly connect with the current dialogue, such as specifics about the past marathon or the location details of the speakers. The MEMORY could be more focused on elements that would help Speaker B generate a response in line with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Thus, while it contains helpful information, it could be more directly connected to the current interaction."
