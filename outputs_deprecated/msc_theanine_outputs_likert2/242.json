Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not!\nSpeaker B: Have you been hiking lately?\nSpeaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks, and has planned several camping trips for the summer. She will also be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail for 10 days.\n2. Speaker A has a pet parrot named Tasha and works as a personal trainer leading hikes. This led to Speaker A becoming a personal trainer who loves camping in remote areas. Recently, Speaker B went on a long hike and enjoyed it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information that can help Speaker B generate a relevant response. It offers insights into Speaker A's outdoor interests and activities, which relates to the current conversation about hiking and using repellent. It also mentions specific plans like the Appalachian Trail hike, which could be relevant to discuss in response to recent hiking experiences. However, the connection between certain pieces of information is somewhat unclear, such as the relevance of Speaker B having gone on a long hike and enjoying it. Additionally, the sentence about Speaker A becoming a personal trainer could be better structured to relate to the current hiking topic. Overall, while there are relevant pieces of information, the memory could benefit from clearer connections and more focused relevance to the current context."
