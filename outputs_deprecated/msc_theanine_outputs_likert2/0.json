Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I forgot to ask if you've purchased your plane tickets yet?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is excited about Easter weekend and spring break. They want to go on a trip but have not started packing yet. Speaker B recently got a new blue hair color and a new Easter dress. This changed to Speaker B's new car being black, which is their first new car after driving pre-owned cars before. This change caused Speaker B to receive a new car from their mom and plan to drive during spring break. Speaker A is worried about gas mileage and asks about the fuel efficiency of Speaker B's car.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker B's excitement for Easter weekend and spring break, which can potentially tie into the discussion initiated by Speaker A's question about plane tickets. Speaker B's plan to drive during spring break could be directly relevant to the conversation, expounding on whether they have considered plane travel. However, much of the MEMORY is disjointed or focused on details (e.g., hair color, new dress, car color) that do not directly support the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Information about Speaker A being concerned about gas mileage could help guide the conversation, albeit indirectly by discussing travel plans, but it lacks clear connection to the context of buying plane tickets."
