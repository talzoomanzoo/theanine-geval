Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet? \nSpeaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name?\nSpeaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \nSpeaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along!\nSpeaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them.\nSpeaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me!\nSpeaker A: Hahaha. Yes I agree its too hot to get a long hike in. I've been on some short ones, but the bugs eat me alive. I like to hike in the fall when the bugs are dying off and its a little cooler.\nSpeaker B: Ah yes, that's my favorite time of year. Oh and speaking of Tasha, I'm still amazed she knows Mandarin. Have you been learning more of the language?\nSpeaker A: I've been learning a little more. I try to learn a few things a day. Tasha's reactions to my talking to myself in Mandarin is funny, she looks confused most of the time.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a pet parrot named Tasha who speaks Mandarin and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten. \nSpeaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities. \n\nSpeaker B lives in the city they grew up in, loves animals, and has a cat that recently had a kitten. \nSpeaker A has a pet named Tasha who speaks Mandarin and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "It's impressive how quickly animals adapt to different languages. Tasha must keep you entertained with her reactions to your Mandarin practice.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides partially helpful information for generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes relevant details such as Speaker A having a pet parrot named Tasha who speaks Mandarin, which is discussed in the context, and Speaker Aâ€™s interest in adopting a rescue kitten, also mentioned in the context. These points demonstrate a connection between past and present interactions. However, some parts of MEMORY, such as Speaker B filling out adoption paperwork, considering naming kittens with Mandarin names, Speaker B's residing city, and their cat having kittens, are not directly referenced or necessary for the CONTEXT. While the relevant pieces of MEMORY are useful, the additional information does not appear to contribute significantly to the natural flow or development of interactions between speakers regarding the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
