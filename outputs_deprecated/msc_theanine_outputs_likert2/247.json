Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not!\nSpeaker B: Have you been hiking lately?\nSpeaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me.\nSpeaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway?\nSpeaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day! I'll make it as fun as possible.\nSpeaker B: I will someday. just not in the summer when all the bugs are out! Where do you go hiking the most?\nSpeaker A: I like to go hiking in the local trails here. I am familiar with them and there's so many routes that I can take. Sadly, the bugs are as bad here as they are anywhere else.....\nSpeaker B: They can't be that bad in the fall right? I hope? Do you camp most every weekend?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks, which has led to them planning several camping trips for the summer and will be doing a part of the Appalachian Trail. They also lead hikes for the group they camp with, which are usually an hour or two long, but Speaker A is now nervous about the Appalachian Trail hike, as they don't usually do full day hikes. Additionally, Speaker A is a personal trainer who loves camping in remote areas and is comfortable around animals in the woods, although they admit a bear would make them jumpy.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I wish I could camp every weekend! But with my schedule, I usually try to go at least once a month. It's a great way for me to unwind and recharge.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker A's interest in hiking and camping, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A discusses hiking with friends, the use of mosquito repellent, and their familiarity with local trails. However, the MEMORY introduces new information (such as planning to do a part of the Appalachian Trail and being a personal trainer) that is not directly connected to the dialogue context's conversation. The causality or progression from past interactions to the current context is not strongly developed in some parts of MEMORY, though it contains some useful details about Speaker A's hiking habits and preferences. To achieve a higher score, the MEMORY should focus more specifically on aspects of hiking and outdoors experiences that directly relate to the ongoing dialogue's direction or topics."
