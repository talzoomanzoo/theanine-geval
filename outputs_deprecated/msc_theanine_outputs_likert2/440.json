Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\nSpeaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it.\nSpeaker A: Cool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot. What is your favorite part about camping?\nSpeaker B: I love being out in the wilderness and sleeping under the stars in the fresh air. It makes you realize how beautiful life is and how small we really are in comparison to the universe.\nSpeaker A: I miss doing that! I have done lots of picnics with my family but it's been a long time since I've slept in a tent! Looking forward to it again when the kids are older. Where was the last place you went?\nSpeaker B: We went up to an island in the middle of nowhere in Canada. There were lots of bears and huge moose!\nSpeaker A: Wow, that sounds like such an adventure! I love to visit Canada. I have seen moose but never a bear! That must have been scary!\nSpeaker B: Yes, it is quite scary. We could also hear the wolves howling at night, luckily we didn't come across them though. One thing to note about bears, is they just want to come and scrounge for our food, so we learned to safely pack it away and hang it up high in a tree.\nSpeaker A: Yes, I've heard that it's important to be careful in bear country! I would love to see one in person though. Do you take lots of photos on your trips?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I took quite a few. The scenery was stunning. Would you like me to send you some photos? I know they are uninteresting to some people.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B's involvement with the scout troop and work at a fast food place leads Speaker A to appreciate it and invite Speaker B to a youth retreat. As a result, Speaker B, who has been in Boy Scouts for 7-8 years and is currently a Life Scout, wants to attend the retreat. \nSpeaker B's aspiration to become an Eagle Scout and not being in college yet is related to Speaker A's involvement in church activities and mentioning a church retreat. This connection leads Speaker A to appreciate Speaker B's scout involvement and invite them to a youth retreat, which Speaker B wants to attend. \nSpeaker B's desire to become an Eagle Scout and having saved vacation days, along with being busy with various activities, makes them willing to use the saved vacation days for the retreat. This decision is influenced by considering attending a local community college for the first couple of years.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information regarding Speaker B's involvement in the Boy Scouts, which is a key topic in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY clearly explains Speaker B's aspiration to become an Eagle Scout, their level of experience in scouting (7-8 years), and their current life stage as someone who is not yet in college but considering attending a local community college, which can be a natural background for someone involved in scouting activities like camping. \n\nHowever, the connection drawn between Speaker B's scouting activities and a church retreat, along with their work at a fast food place, muddies the focus a bit as those aspects do not directly relate to the main topic of the ongoing dialogue about camping, survival skills, and appreciation for the wilderness. Thus, the MEMORY does not fully align with the ongoing discussion and the flow of topics in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\nOverall, while some relevant insights are provided about Speaker B, the contextual and causal connections in MEMORY could be clearer and more focused to better support generating a next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
