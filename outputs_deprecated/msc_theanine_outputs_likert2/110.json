Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys the interaction with people at work and the variety of experiences that come with it, which causes Speaker A to work at a restaurant and invite Speaker B to visit.\n2. Speaker A wants to go rock climbing with Speaker B, and Speaker A also enjoys the interaction with people at work and the variety of experiences that come with it.\n3. Speaker A owns a restaurant and recently experienced a fire incident but managed to put it out, which led to Speaker A working at a restaurant and inviting Speaker B to visit.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information that is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it lacks clarity and natural connection. For instance, it repeatedly mentions Speaker A's enjoyment of interacting with people and variety at work, but does not link this clearly to the addition of Speaker A's favorite dish to the menu. Additionally, the mention of a fire incident and rock climbing do not seem relevant to the current context, making the memory less helpful for generating a coherent and context-specific response. Overall, the MEMORY doesn't provide a strong causality or direct relevance needed to guide the next response effectively."
