Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read.\n\nMEMORY:\n- [Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix.] - (SameTopic) - [Speaker A enjoys watching movies with their grandchildren.] \n- [Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix.] - (SameTopic) - [Speaker A enjoys watching Jeopardy with their grandchildren and cooking for them, with the busiest time being the weekend.]\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant background information about Speaker A, including their interest in reading books, which relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT of checking out a new book to read. This indicates a thematic connection and offers insight into Speaker A's hobbies and family activities. However, the MEMORY does not directly enhance the ability to generate the next response in a specific or detailed manner regarding the new book or specific plans for Speaker A's day. The information aligns with the context but lacks dynamic or nuanced interaction hints that would be more beneficial for generating a response."
