Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive.\nSpeaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B have a friendly interaction and part ways on a positive note. Speaker A mentions that Speaker B's kids could try milking cows on the farm, which Speaker B finds amusing. This causes Speaker A to work on a family farm and will be using the new truck for farm work. \nSpeaker B believes that luxurious items distract from the value of their family. As a result, Speaker B leads a hectic life but is interested in attending the concert with their kids during winter break. This leads to Speaker B's children being sick, and Speaker B also had a fever, possibly influencing their decision to buy 20 lotto tickets.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some information that could be tangentially relevant or add context to the dialogue, such as Speaker A's involvement in farm work, Speaker B's hectic lifestyle, and their philosophy on luxurious items. However, these details are not directly connected to the dialogue about the new iPhone, and their relevance to creating an appropriate response is limited. The connections between the events in the memory feel disjointed and don't establish a clear causality or relevance to the conversation at hand, which is about the satisfaction with a new purchase. Overall, the MEMORY does not provide strong, direct information that would help generate a more informed or contextually accurate response in the dialogue context."
