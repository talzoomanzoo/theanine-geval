Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week?\nSpeaker B: I sure did.

    "raw_prediction": "I haven't played Resident Evil yet, but I've been enjoying some other games. How was your experience with it during the storm?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that is helpful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that Speaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically mentioning Resident Evil, which is directly connected to the question asked by Speaker A about playing Resident Evil. It also highlights that Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy playing video games, and that they plan to play together, potentially with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil, which provides context for further conversation. The MEMORY notes Speaker A's hesitation towards horror games like Resident Evil, and Speaker B's tips for playing the game, which could be relevant for Speaker B's response.\n\nHowever, there is some repetition of information (like Speaker B playing League of Legends) that is not directly relevant to the immediate topic of Resident Evil. Despite this, the MEMORY is generally well-structured and provides useful context and connections for the continuation of the dialogue."
