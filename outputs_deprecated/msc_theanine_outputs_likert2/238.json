Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet? \nSpeaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name?\nSpeaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \nSpeaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along!\nSpeaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them.\nSpeaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me!\nSpeaker A: Hahaha. Yes I agree its too hot to get a long hike in. I've been on some short ones, but the bugs eat me alive. I like to hike in the fall when the bugs are dying off and its a little cooler.\nSpeaker B: Ah yes, that's my favorite time of year. Oh and speaking of Tasha, I'm still amazed she knows Mandarin. Have you been learning more of the language?\nSpeaker A: I've been learning a little more. I try to learn a few things a day. Tasha's reactions to my talking to myself in Mandarin is funny, she looks confused most of the time.\nSpeaker B: That is funny. And impressive that you're learning. The closest I can get to another language is doing a bad New York accent LOL\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B loves animals, lives in the city they grew up in, and has a cat that recently had a kitten. This led Speaker B to have two sick kitties and recently receive a rescue. Speaker A, on the other hand, has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten. Speaker B recently filled out adoption paperwork for rescue kittens and is considering giving them Mandarin names based on their personalities.\n\nSpeaker A, a country girl who loves animals and is a lacto-ovo vegetarian, now has a pet named Tasha who speaks Mandarin. As a result, Speaker A has been learning Mandarin, and Tasha has started saying Chinese phrases instead of English ones. This has led Speaker A to be interested in adopting a rescue kitten, similar to Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Haha, well, at least a New York accent adds some flair! I'm sure Tasha finds your Mandarin quite entertaining.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but lacks clarity in some places. It tells us about Speaker B's love for animals and their connection to the kittens, mentioning Speaker B's cat and kittens. This aligns with the dialogue where Speaker B names their black and white kitten Oreo. It also notes Speaker A's interest in adopting rescue kittens, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Furthermore, it links Speaker A's Mandarin learning and their pet, Tasha, who speaks Mandarin, which is discussed in the dialogue.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY could be more clearly structured to demonstrate the connection between these events. It mentions that Speaker B filled out adoption paperwork, a detail not mirrored in the dialogue, which may not be directly helpful for generating a response. Additionally, the mention of Speaker B considering giving kittens Mandarin names adds some context but isn't directly referred to in the dialogue.\n\nTo summarize, the MEMORY is helpful to an extent but could benefit from clearer connections and relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
