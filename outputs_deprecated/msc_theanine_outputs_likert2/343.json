Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it! Thank you for the recommendation.\nSpeaker B: Of course. I recommend that movie to everyone I meet. I think I've watched it over one hundred times. So what is the next movie on your list to watch soon?\nSpeaker A: Yeah it was great and I will also recommend to people when they ask what movie is good. So next is another one you recommended which is coming to America. What’s the next movie your going to watch? \nSpeaker B: There is a horror genre movie that was released just this week which I'm going to watch tonight. It is called \"Girl Next.\"\nSpeaker A: Oh that sounds interesting, I will look into that and put it on my list. How has your job been going? Is there where you get all these great ideas for what to watch?  \nSpeaker B: My Film Studies professor job has been going absolutely great lately. I love all my students, because they really get into the lectures and ask lots of questions. Yes, my job requires me to watch movies all the time, so that is how I find the best ones. Is your programmer job going all right lately?\nSpeaker A: That sounds amazing. Super lucky to have students that really enjoy what they are learning about and I’m sure that’s down to the way you teach and what you teach them. I’m so glad it is all going well for you. Yeah it is going much better now, I’m really getting in the swing of things thank you for asking. \nSpeaker B: You're welcome. So, returning to the subject of Pulp Fiction, did you think it was funny? Did you think it was too violent for kids to watch?\nSpeaker A: Yeah there was some funny parts in that movie. I kinda think it may be a little to violent for kids, but I would just allow it to each parent to decide I would probably let my grandkids watch. What is your opinion? \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys programming and plans to go for a long run after work. Speaker B enjoys watching suspense films, action, SF, horror, westerns, drama, and occasional good comedy. Speaker A is interested in watching movies, mentioned Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman. Speaker B used to teach Film Studies and carefully chooses what movies to watch. Speaker B is knowledgeable about movies and provides recommendations based on Speaker A's preferences. Speaker B has a sister who shares the same opinion about age as Speaker A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I agree, Pulp Fiction definitely has some funny moments, but I also think it's too violent for kids. Parents should have the final say on what their children watch.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information that could aid in generating a proper response. It establishes Speaker A's interest in movies and their role as a programmer, which relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where movies are the primary topic of discussion. The MEMORY also highlights Speaker B's Film Studies background and expertise in movies, which aligns with their character traits in the conversation. Information on Speaker B's preferences in movie genres and their connection to a sister with similar age opinions is adequately linked to the ongoing dialogue, adding depth that may influence the response about age-appropriateness of \"Pulp Fiction.\" However, the mention of Speaker A planning to go for a long run feels somewhat unrelated to the main movie discussion, preventing a perfect score."
