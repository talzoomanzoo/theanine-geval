Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A recently got a Subaru and has a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Marmalade. Speaker A enjoys taking their kitten on trips. Speaker A usually leaves their cats with a friend while traveling.\nSpeaker B went on a trip to San Diego with kids, struggled with parking for the Subaru. Speaker B is not a cat person but ends up taking care of stray cats brought home by kids.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about Speaker A's and Speaker B's lives, but it lacks a strong, direct connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The mention of Speaker A considering a new kitten named Marmalade is relevant, but the ultimate decision to name the kitten Pumpkin is not reflected in the MEMORY. Additionally, although Speaker B's struggle with parking the Subaru and their interaction with cats is mentioned, these don't directly relate to the current conversation about naming a kitten. The MEMORY has useful details about pets and cars which can be tangentially related, but it does not have a clear causality or relevance to the specific context of naming the kitten Pumpkin. Therefore, it only somewhat helps in generating a meaningful response."
