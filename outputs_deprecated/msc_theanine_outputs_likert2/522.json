Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer?\nSpeaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July.

    "raw_prediction": "No, I haven't seen the fireworks at the Disney castle, but it sounds magical. I hope to experience it someday.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that can be useful for generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it connects Speaker B's enjoyment of live music and city living to the context where a music concert and fireworks were discussed. It also provides context about Speaker A's interest in art and museums, which aligns with the discussion about the art museum in the dialogue. However, there are a few redundancies (such as repeated sentences about Speaker B's driving and city living preferences) and some disconnected elements (like planning a trip to Sao Paulo and shopping) that lack clear relevance to the ongoing conversation. While the MEMORY includes some helpful points, it doesn't fully integrate or demonstrate clear causality between the events mentioned and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
