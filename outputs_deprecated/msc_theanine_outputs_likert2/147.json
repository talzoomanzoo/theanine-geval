Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?\nSpeaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping?\nSpeaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp?\nSpeaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer?\nSpeaker A: I've only camped in a tent so far, but would like to try out a camper trailer. What do use for camping?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A mentions starting their own zoo, comparing it to being a grandparent. This leads Speaker B's child to express interest in visiting the zoo, especially to see the monkeys. This topic continues as Speaker B, a parent, advocates for a school field trip to the zoo for their daughter.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nThe MEMORY provided does not offer any relevant information or context that would assist in generating a response for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses on a conversation about camping preferences and experiences, while the MEMORY offers unrelated information about a zoo and a school field trip. The MEMORY lacks any details about camping or related topics, making it unhelpful for the conversation at hand. Additionally, the content in the MEMORY is not connected to the current dialogue, lacking causality or relevancy to the camping topic being discussed."
