Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science, and wants to develop apps for differently abled youth. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics. \nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science. Speaker B is considering getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities. \nSpeaker B majoring in linguistics causes Speaker A to be interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you! I'm lucky to have supportive parents. How about you, do your parents support your decision to pursue teaching?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe memory provides some helpful information but also includes some redundant and repetitive details. It contains relevant background about Speaker A's interest in teaching computer science and specifically in the field of robotics, which is directly connected to the Dialogue Context where Speaker A expresses a desire to teach robotics someday. This connection is clear and helpful in understanding Speaker A's career aspirations.\n\nHowever, the memory could be better organized and more concise. Some sentences repeat information unnecessarily, such as mentioning Speaker A working at a pizza shop and studying computer science in separate places. Additionally, the mention of Speaker B's consideration of further education or a career in linguistics is not very connected to the current Dialogue Context, which focuses more on career choices and teaching as a stable job option. Speaker B's feeling of limited job opportunities is relevant but should be more concisely linked to their future considerations or decisions. Overall, the memory has useful parts but could benefit from more coherence and focus on the context at hand."
