Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "San Diego Zoo is amazing! You'll have a great time there.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information for Speaker A in generating a next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It touches on Speaker B's enjoyment of visiting the zoo, which is directly mentioned in the context where Speaker B is looking forward to visiting the San Diego Zoo. Furthermore, it mentions that Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten, connecting with the opening question of the context. However, the MEMORY also contains redundant information and does not provide a complete, naturally flowing narrative since much of the information is repeated or not directly useful for continuing the specific conversation about adopting a kitten or going on vacation to San Diego. More coherent and specific detail regarding the kitten adoption plans or vacation specifics would improve its helpfulness."
