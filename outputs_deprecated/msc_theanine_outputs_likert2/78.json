Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\nSpeaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has a lot of kids, all grown up now and with kids of their own, causing Speaker A to have kids and be busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. Speaker B wants to spend time with their grandkids at the park, reacting to their grandkids being more interested in phones and tablets than musical instruments. \nSpeaker A, a librarian who loves kids, mentioned having 3 children, which changed to Speaker B mentioning having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own. Speaker B enjoys spending time with their grandkids at the park, reacting to taking them fishing once with mixed reactions. Speaker B's kids do not go to work by boat like Speaker A, but now Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park, reacting to their interest in technology over musical instruments.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great, it's important to stay connected in whatever way works best for you!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker B's relationship with their children and grandchildren, which offers context to their preference for traditional communication methods like phone calls. The MEMORY also emphasizes Speaker B's interest in spending time with their grandchildren at the park, which is relevant to the discussion about technology vs. traditional activities. However, the MEMORY is somewhat repetitive and not all the details (like fishing or going to work by boat) are directly connected or necessary for generating a next response to the provided DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The logical connection between some sentences is not very strong, and the usefulness of this information for continuing the dialogue is somewhat limited."
