Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well?\nSpeaker B: I haven't!

Similarly, Speaker A is studying marketing and enjoys it. They also want to explore the world of martial arts like Speaker B, who practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work.

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds great! I'm looking forward to it. Let's plan for tomorrow at 3 pm at the Dojo. Lunch after sounds perfect too!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response, particularly related to Speaker B's familiarity with karate, as this topic aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY mentions Speaker B's karate practice, which supports their recommendation of karate and offer to bring Speaker A to the dojo. However, some details, such as Speaker Bâ€™s interest in switching careers to IT, professional background, and other personal habits, are less relevant to the current dialogue context. While these details provide depth to Speaker B's character, they do not contribute directly to the interaction or decisions being made in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, some elements, like redundant information or unrelated details about sun care, could be improved or omitted to maintain focus on the conversation about martial arts.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY could be improved by offering more direct causality or follow-up details specific to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as previous interactions about martial arts, without redundant or tangential information."
