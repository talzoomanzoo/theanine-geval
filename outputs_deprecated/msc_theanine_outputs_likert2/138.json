Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\nSpeaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach?\nSpeaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option.\nSpeaker A: Yes I think history is interesting, too! Both of those subjects would be great because there are probably lots of teaching jobs. What kind of history do you like?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job. This has led Speaker A to be interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics. \nSpeaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job. This has led Speaker B to consider getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. This decision has made Speaker B feel limited in job opportunities.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker B's background and career aspirations, which aids in generating a contextually appropriate next response. It highlights Speaker B's major in linguistics and their interest in pursuing a practical job related to that field. Additionally, it mentions their consideration of further education and the potential pursuit of becoming a college professor, reflecting the conversation about career options. However, the MEMORY contains redundant sentences and lacks a clear connection or causality between Speaker B's aspirations and Speaker A's interests in teaching robotics. More concise and cohesive sentences would better demonstrate the development and relevancy of past interactions, enhancing the helpfulness for generating responses to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
