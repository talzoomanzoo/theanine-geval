Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends?\nSpeaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do.\nSpeaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars.\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I think they go dark for a couple months and then have daylight for a couple months! I actually like night time, but having daylight all the time will make me crazy lol. Yeah I kind of hope it's dark for the camping but it will be very cold. I have heard Alaska has delicious ice cream. I want to try that while I'm there, \nSpeaker A: You'd have to get some serious blackout curtains for when it was daylight lol! You'll have to stock up on some warm essentials before heading out. You definitely don't want to get stuck in a bad situation in the cold, especially if you're alone. I bet they have great ice cream! You'll have to tell me about it when you get back!\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I need to call my friend and find out what season they are in so I can pack accordingly. I will take pictures of the ice cream too so I can tell you about it. I wonder if there are a lot of bears there? I don't like bears either.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Speaker A and Speaker B are discussing their upcoming trip to Alaska and planning activities together.\n- Speaker B is going to Alaska for a vacation in two weeks and has some experience with flying on airplanes. Speaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking. Speaker A mentions the outdoor activities they plan to do in Alaska, such as hiking.\n- Speaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet. Speaker A has the impression that Alaska is cold and snowy, wondering if there are ski slopes there.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a generally relevant overview of the ongoing conversation, mentioning the trip to Alaska, planning activities, and familiarity with the destination's outdoor activities. However, it lacks specific details that directly correlate to the current dialogue context, particularly the discussion of daylight and darkness in Alaska, dog sledding, and camping. While there is some mention of planning and the cold climate, the MEMORY could be more directly helpful if it included details about lighting conditions or specific seasons in Alaska, given Speaker B's concerns about packing and the different daylight hours. Additionally, the mention of the friend and experiences with planes are not crucial points in the current context. The MEMORY does not fully capture the specific topics discussed, such as ice cream or fear of bears. Overall, it is partially relevant but not as cohesive and specifically connected as it could be."
