Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college?\nSpeaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position. \nSpeaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it?\nSpeaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \nSpeaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living.\nSpeaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime?\nSpeaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with.\nSpeaker A: Sounds great! Now the tough question: when do you have time?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket but now plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week. They are a member of a soccer team and enjoy playing in tournaments. \nSpeaker A is a college student majoring in Humanities, not currently employed but used to work part-time at a supermarket. Lately, Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information in that it mentions Speaker A's involvement in soccer, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where soccer is a topic of discussion. It notes that Speaker A plays as a striker and enjoys playing in tournaments, which could be relevant to the conversation about playing soccer games. However, the memory does not provide any direct causality or connection between past interactions and the current dialogue context. Furthermore, it includes information, like Speaker A's previous job at a supermarket and their college major in Humanities, which is extraneous to the current context where they are discussing playing soccer and arranging casual games. While the MEMORY is somewhat relevant, it lacks natural connectivity and doesn't fully demonstrate causality or relevance to substantially enhance the language model's response generation for this dialogue context."
