Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies!\nSpeaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?  \nSpeaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere!\nSpeaker B: You have a point.  It is nice to see puppies wagging their tail and just following you!  Changing topics, do you have any recipes with asparagus?  You know, it's such a popular vegetable, but I just don't know how to prepare it.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Speaker A used to foster puppies but no longer does because they are busy with work, and now mainly cares for dogs at the animal shelter, but also cats, and loves when new puppies are brought in.\n- Speaker A's interest in science over music contrasts with Speaker B's love for Black Sabbath and grilling meat, but they both share a passion for animals, especially puppies, and visiting shelters in every city they go to.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I love asparagus! One of my favorite ways to prepare it is by roasting it with some olive oil, garlic, and parmesan cheese. It's simple and delicious!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about Speaker A's past interactions, such as fostering puppies and their shared passion with Speaker B for animals and shelters. However, it does not provide any information relevant to the current topic of asparagus recipes, which is a major part of the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Also, the information about their contrasting interests in science and music is not directly connected to the ongoing conversation, making it less helpful. While the MEMORY includes information about animals, it is not specific enough to guide the conversation based on the current dialogue. Overall, the MEMORY's utility in assisting with generating the next response is limited."
