Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok? \nSpeaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish?\nSpeaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus!\nSpeaker B: Oh that sounds absolutely fabulous. Are you going to get a free dessert, as well?\nSpeaker A: Yes, I am thinking about trying either the new eclairs, or their tres leches cake with fresh raspberry jam sauce and lemon drizzle! I have too many good options to pick from! What one would you pick?\nSpeaker B: Hands down, I would pick the tres leches. Ever since I tried it a few years ago, it has always been my favorite dessert.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit. Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule. Speaker A gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I think I'll go with the tres leches then. It's always good to have a favorite dessert!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful background information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker A works at a restaurant, which is pertinent to the discussion about menu items and desserts. Moreover, the MEMORY includes details about Speaker A getting free meals and leftover baked goods, which aligns with the part of the context where Speaker A talks about trying dishes for free. This connection helps clarify why Speaker A can easily try different dishes and desserts. However, the MEMORY does not directly mention the specific food items being discussed in the context, such as Chicken parmesan or the desserts, which slightly limits its usefulness in enhancing the continuation of this specific conversation. Overall, the MEMORY is well-structured and almost provides a complete and natural connection to the development of the dialogue."
