Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys watching swimming movies and wants to listen to punk music while swimming and learning programming.\nSpeaker B is looking forward to eating a pizza burger in a pool with punk music playing. \nSpeaker A enjoys cruising in their car while listening to punk music. Speaker A enjoys the food and the adventure of cruises and wants to discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together with Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information about Speaker B's preferences for punk music and swimming, which connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT of planning a meetup with a punk music playlist. However, the MEMORY includes some details that are less directly relevant to the context, such as Speaker A's enjoyment of car cruises and cruise ships, which are not immediately pertinent to the planned meetup activities. Additionally, the MEMORY mentions Speaker B's desire to eat a pizza burger in a pool with punk music, which provides some insight into Speaker B's personality and interests but doesn't clearly connect to the conversation about programming studies or the meetup. Overall, the MEMORY provides some helpful context for generating a response, but it includes extraneous details that are not as connected to the current dialogue."
