Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The garlic chicken sounds delicious. Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make?\nSpeaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it.\nSpeaker A: I would love to, I enjoy cooking so maybe you can teach me to make it, too?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe because Speaker B's grandmother was the matriarch of the family, known for cooking large meals for family gatherings. \nSpeaker A likes cooking new dishes and following recipes occasionally as a change from preferring surfing and growing up in a beach town.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful information that can help Speaker B build a relevant and connected response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights Speaker B's enjoyment of cooking and their sentimental value attached to their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe, which aligns well with the discussion about cooking and trying new recipes. Additionally, it provides context about Speaker A's interest in cooking new dishes, which can naturally lead Speaker B to propose cooking together or sharing more about their cooking traditions. However, the MEMORY could be even more helpful if it included more details about the connection between the specific dishes mentioned in the context (e.g., spicy fried rice) and Speaker B's personal experiences."
