Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons\nSpeaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use.\nSpeaker B: I am a little scared of needles though. Were your tattoos painful?\nSpeaker A: Most of them were not.  It really depends on where on your body you get them.  Most of mine are on areas that didn't hurt.  The one on my foot and the one behind my ear did hurt a good bit.  Where were you thinking about getting it?\nSpeaker B: I hadn't really thought about it! Maybe upper arm or upper back? But I'm no tattoo expert. And I'd have to get permission from my wife first, LOL\nSpeaker A: Definitely talk to her first.  I had a friend that didn't talk to his wife and just came home with a tattoo one day.  It led to a huge fight - both about the money he spent and not discussing it with her.  He slept on my couch for over a week!\nSpeaker B: Oh no! Yeah, you don't want to spring something like that on your spouse. I don't think you mentioned before, are you married?\nSpeaker A: No.  I haven't found anyone that could deal with me or that I could deal with for more than a few months.  At this point, I have given up on the idea of getting married and want to focus on my artwork.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A plans to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest. They enjoy getting tattoos and have 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father. They work at a coffee shop and are saving up for their next tattoo. Their favorite tattoo is the one dedicated to their late father, saying \"for you I shall live.\"\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's understandable. Focusing on your artwork sounds like a great way to channel your energy and creativity.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information about Speaker A's tattoos, particularly the sentimental value and meaning behind them, which ties into the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where they discuss tattoo ideas to honor parents. It reveals that Speaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has a specific one dedicated to their late father, providing context to their enthusiasm in the conversation. However, the MEMORY doesn't connect well with the ongoing dialogue where they discuss marriage or relationships, as it focuses solely on the tattoos aspect. Additionally, it lacks information about any conversations or interactions they had previously, making the causality and relevance of certain details less apparent. Thus, while some parts are helpful, the overall connection to the full dialogue context isn't as strong."
