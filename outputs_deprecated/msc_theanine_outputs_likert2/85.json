Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\nSpeaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call!\nSpeaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip? \nSpeaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery\nSpeaker B: Yes I think that's a great idea, how is work at the library? \nSpeaker A: Busy, and demanding because we are short staffed. While there seems to be little need for a library these days, I find that we have less staff to get everything done\nSpeaker B: Well if you ever need someone to come and help for a couple of hours here and there, give me a call, you know how much I love to be in the library anyway\nSpeaker A: I will keep that in mind as we do have volunteer hours available. How is your family doing these days?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A used to be a librarian and loves kids, mentioning having 3 children. This is similar to Speaker B mentioning having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own. Speaker B also has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park, which is why they took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.\n\nSpeaker B's mother was also a librarian like Speaker A, which causes Speaker A to be a retired librarian who enjoys implementing creative activities in their library.\n\nSpeaker B has a lot of kids, all grown up now and with kids of their own. This causes Speaker A to have kids and be busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. Speaker B wants to spend time with their grandkids in the park, while Speaker A has children and grandchildren, with at least one child interested in learning the flute.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "My family is doing well, thank you for asking. How are your kids and grandkids holding up with everything going on?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be helpful for generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights the shared experiences of Speaker A and Speaker B, both having children and grandchildren, and mentioning Speaker B's interest in spending time with family. These elements align with the ongoing conversation about family, technology, and work-life balance. However, the information is somewhat scattered, with some sentences not clearly linked to the specific dialogue context, such as the details about Speaker A being a retired librarian, which do not directly contribute to the current interaction. Furthermore, the causality and relevance between events and statements are not always clearly established, which affects the natural flow and coherence of the MEMORY. Therefore, MEMORY provides moderate usefulness for informing Speaker B's next response but could be improved by better linkage and emphasis on directly relevant details."
