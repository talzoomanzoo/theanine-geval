Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it! Thank you for the recommendation.\nSpeaker B: Of course. I recommend that movie to everyone I meet. I think I've watched it over one hundred times. So what is the next movie on your list to watch soon?\nSpeaker A: Yeah it was great and I will also recommend to people when they ask what movie is good. So next is another one you recommended which is coming to America. What’s the next movie your going to watch? \nSpeaker B: There is a horror genre movie that was released just this week which I'm going to watch tonight. It is called \"Girl Next.\"\nSpeaker A: Oh that sounds interesting, I will look into that and put it on my list. How has your job been going? Is there where you get all these great ideas for what to watch?  \nSpeaker B: My Film Studies professor job has been going absolutely great lately. I love all my students, because they really get into the lectures and ask lots of questions. Yes, my job requires me to watch movies all the time, so that is how I find the best ones. Is your programmer job going all right lately?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys watching a variety of movie genres with their kids and provides recommendations based on Speaker A's preferences. Speaker B used to teach Film Studies and now carefully chooses what movies to watch. Speaker A is interested in watching movies, mentioned Pulp Fiction, and Uma Thurman. Speaker B's sister shares the same opinion about age as Speaker A and they both used to teach Film Studies. Speaker A was disappointed with the movie \"Showtime\" starring Eddie Murphy and DeNiro.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: MEMORY includes some information that might be relevant to generating a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It provides insight into Speaker B's interests and background as a former Film Studies teacher, which aligns with Speaker B's mention of teaching Film Studies in the dialogue. It also notes Speaker A's interest in films, including \"Pulp Fiction,\" which is relevant as it was recently discussed. However, there are other parts of the MEMORY that are not directly relevant to the current conversation, like Speaker B watching movies with their kids or Speaker A's disappointment with \"Showtime.\" Additionally, some connections in the MEMORY, such as Speaker B's opinions aligning with Speaker A's or mentioning Uma Thurman, are not directly tied to the present conversation. Overall, while there is some useful context, other parts are less relevant or connected."
