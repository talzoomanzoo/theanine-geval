Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin!\nSpeaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name? \nSpeaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls! \nSpeaker B: I see what you meant. Plus the color is beautiful orange. I want to see them together, even I am not a cat person they must be cute together at that time. Once the kitten grows up, situation gonna change to me. How are they, they are doing well?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B loves dogs which is a reason Speaker A has a kitten from their cat and enjoys taking them on trips. Speaker A has a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Marmalade.\n2. Speaker A drives a Mini Cooper and recently visited a hair salon, leading to Speaker A having a kitten from their cat and enjoying taking them on trips. Speaker B is excited for the trip and looking forward to trying the best iced tea.\n3. Speaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten, prompting Speaker A to have a kitten from their cat and enjoy taking them on trips instead of leaving their cats with a friend while traveling. Speaker A and Speaker B have a light-hearted and humorous conversation about their pets and travels.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "They're doing great! Pumpkin is full of energy and Ginger is adjusting well to being a new mom. It's been quite the adventure having them around.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some fragments of information that could help in generating a response, but it is mostly disjointed and lacks clear relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n1. While point 1 mentions the potential kitten names and the fact that Speaker A has a cat named Ginger, the reasoning behind these choices is not clearly connected, and it does not add much to the current conversation about changing the kitten's name to Pumpkin. Additionally, the mention of Speaker A's Subaru feels irrelevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\n2. Point 2 talks about a Mini Cooper and a hair salon visit, which seem unrelated to the conversation about pets. The excitement for a trip and iced tea forms a separate thread, disjointed from the kitten naming discussion.\n\n3. Point 3 gives a vague context about the kitten's birth and enjoyable trips with the pets, but it doesn't directly align with the current dialogue development about renaming the kitten. It introduces ideas that are unconnected to what's being discussed.\n\nOverall, though there are sentences that briefly touch on past interactions, the MEMORY fails to provide a coherent narrative or clear causality that directly relates to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The disconnect between the MEMORY and the ongoing conversation means it lacks helpfulness, earning it a low score."
