Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do your sons like ice skating as well?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both have two sons, and Speaker A enjoys spending time with their sons despite worrying about them traveling far away. Speaker B is trying to encourage one of their sons to get into programming or writing, but the son is more interested in gaming with friends. Speaker A's sons play video games and listen to music in their rooms. Speaker B is good at ice skating and suggests going to an ice skating rink during winter break.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "Yes, they enjoy ice skating too. It's a fun activity we all like to do together during the winter.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides pertinent information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions both Speaker A and Speaker B having two sons, which is relevant since Speaker A is asking about Speaker B's sons. Additionally, since Speaker B is good at ice skating and suggests going to an ice skating rink during winter break, this connects to Speaker A's question about ice skating and indicates potential follow-up questions or topics related to shared activities. The MEMORY also provides insight into the interests and activities of both pairs of sons, although not all of it is directly related to ice skating, it still creates a contextual background for understanding their dynamics and potential interests. The causality and relevance of events are fairly well demonstrated, allowing for a continuation of the conversation in a natural and meaningful way."
