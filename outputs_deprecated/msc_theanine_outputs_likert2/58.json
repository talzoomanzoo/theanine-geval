Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\nSpeaker B: That's great! Where did you go on your walk?\nSpeaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous.\nSpeaker B: That sounds amazing! Did you bring a pet? I love doing the harder trails with my dog. Sometimes, it's very peaceful to get away from everything.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys reading fantasy books and recommends \"A Game of Thrones\" by George R. R. Martin. Speaker A also enjoyed reading 'Redwall' growing up and keeps an eye out for similar books. Speaker B enjoys reading the Odd Thomas and Dark Tower series and finds inspiration for their artwork during nature walks. Speaker A recommends the new album by Highly Suspect to Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I didn't bring a pet this time, but I can imagine how peaceful it must be to have a furry companion on the trail with you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some background information about Speaker A and B's reading preferences and Speaker B's interest in nature walks, which could be slightly relevant to the dialogue context where Speaker A describes their nature walk. However, the focus on book and music recommendations does not provide direct relevance or causality to the current dialogue about the nature walk, making it less helpful for generating an appropriate next response. The MEMORY lacks a natural connection to the dialogue context and does not enhance the understanding of their previous interactions regarding walks or related topics significantly."
