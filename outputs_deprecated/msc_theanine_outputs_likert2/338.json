Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it! Thank you for the recommendation.\nSpeaker B: Of course. I recommend that movie to everyone I meet. I think I've watched it over one hundred times. So what is the next movie on your list to watch soon?\nSpeaker A: Yeah it was great and I will also recommend to people when they ask what movie is good. So next is another one you recommended which is coming to America. What’s the next movie your going to watch? \nSpeaker B: There is a horror genre movie that was released just this week which I'm going to watch tonight. It is called \"Girl Next.\"\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B, who just turned 40 and considers themselves too old for certain activities, used to teach Film Studies and carefully chooses what movies to watch. Speaker A, interested in watching movies, mentioned Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman.\n2. Speaker B, who has kids and enjoys watching movies with them, used to teach Film Studies and carefully chooses what movies to watch. Speaker B, knowledgeable about movies, provides recommendations based on Speaker A's preferences.\n3. Speaker A enjoys programming and plans to go for a long run after work. Speaker B enjoys watching suspense films, action, SF, horror, westerns, drama, and occasional good comedy. Speaker B highlighted Eddie Murphy's success in cop roles in movies like Beverly Hills Cop trilogy and \"I-SPY.\"\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant background information that can be helpful in generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives context to Speaker B's expertise and interest in movies, specifically mentioning their background in teaching Film Studies and preference for certain movie genres, all of which relate to the ongoing conversation about movie recommendations. However, the MEMORY includes some unrelated information, such as Speaker A's interest in programming and running, which do not directly contribute to the dialogue context about movie recommendations. Although the information about Eddie Murphy could tie into a broader movie-related conversation, it doesn't connect directly to the immediate discussion or the movies mentioned (Pulp Fiction and Coming to America). Therefore, while parts of the MEMORY are helpful, others are less relevant to the current context, which limits its overall helpfulness."
