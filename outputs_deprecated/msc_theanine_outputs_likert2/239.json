Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought of any names for the kittens yet? \nSpeaker B: I was considering naming one of them Oreo because she's black and white, what do you think of that name?\nSpeaker A: Very fitting. Great name for a black and white cat. I looked in adopting some kittens like you recommended. \nSpeaker B: Rescuing animals is a great thing to do. But I wonder if the cats and your parrot would get along!\nSpeaker A: They might not get along but Tasha can hold her own. Plus I think she would get a kick out of watching them.\nSpeaker B: Haha. So have you been hiking lately? It's been a hot summer, I think it'd kill me!\nSpeaker A: Hahaha. Yes I agree its too hot to get a long hike in. I've been on some short ones, but the bugs eat me alive. I like to hike in the fall when the bugs are dying off and its a little cooler.\nSpeaker B: Ah yes, that's my favorite time of year. Oh and speaking of Tasha, I'm still amazed she knows Mandarin. Have you been learning more of the language?\nSpeaker A: I've been learning a little more. I try to learn a few things a day. Tasha's reactions to my talking to myself in Mandarin is funny, she looks confused most of the time.\nSpeaker B: That is funny. And impressive that you're learning. The closest I can get to another language is doing a bad New York accent LOL\nSpeaker A: I can't wait to go to New York and hear that accent. It's a great accent, always makes me laugh a little though.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has a cat that recently had a kitten, and this causes Speaker A's neighbor to look after Tasha while Speaker A is away. Speaker A has been learning Mandarin, which results in Tasha starting to say Chinese phrases instead of English ones. Speaker A is now learning Mandarin as a reaction to this. \nSpeaker B lives in the city they grew up in, loves animals, and has a cat that recently had a kitten. Speaker A also has a pet named Tasha who speaks Mandarin. Speaker A has a parrot named Tasha and is interested in adopting a rescue kitten. Speaker A is interested in training tips for the kittens and is open to adopting one despite having a parrot. \nSpeaker A, a country girl who loves animals and is a lacto-ovo vegetarian, has transitioned to having a pet named Tasha who speaks Mandarin. This change leads to Speaker A wanting to visit China and planning to travel somewhere in the US first, likely New York City.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm sure you'll have a blast in New York with all the different accents you'll hear. Do you have any specific plans for your trip yet?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides several key pieces of information that are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It accurately reflects Speaker B's interest in animals and provides details about Speaker A's pet Tasha, who speaks Mandarin. This is particularly useful given that the conversation mentioned Tasha and the language learning aspect. The MEMORY also captures Speaker A's interest in adopting rescue kittens, which aligns with the context where adopting kittens was discussed.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY does contain some extraneous details, such as the mention of Speaker A being a country girl and a lacto-ovo vegetarian, and it incompletely represents the context around Speaker A's plans to travel. Additionally, some sentences are repetitive, specifically about Speaker B's cat having kittens. While this doesn't detract heavily from the MEMORY's usefulness, it prevents it from getting a perfect score. Overall, the MEMORY provides helpful and relevant context that can aid in generating a continuation of the dialogue."
