Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies!\nSpeaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?  \nSpeaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A loves animals, especially puppies, and visits shelters in every city they go to. Speaker B is interested in volunteering and prefers cats over dogs, especially kittens.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I guess that's true, puppies do have that adorable and energetic charm about them.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant background information that can help a language model generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It clearly states that Speaker A loves puppies and visits shelters, which aligns with Speaker A's comments about puppies in the dialogue. Additionally, it conveys Speaker B's interest in volunteering and preference for cats, offering a context for why Speaker B might question Speaker A's preference for puppies. This MEMORY is well-structured, relevant, and naturally connected to the conversation, making it highly helpful."
