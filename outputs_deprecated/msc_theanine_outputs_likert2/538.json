Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: A new cat arrived at the shelter. He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies!\nSpeaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?  \nSpeaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere!\nSpeaker B: You have a point.  It is nice to see puppies wagging their tail and just following you!  Changing topics, do you have any recipes with asparagus?  You know, it's such a popular vegetable, but I just don't know how to prepare it.\nSpeaker A: I don't have recipes but I know how to make a good grilled asparagus. Are you looking to bolster your chef book?\nSpeaker B: I sure am!  Grilled asparagus does sound good.  Do you pair the grilled asparagus with your fajitas?  What do you prefer, chicken or beef fajitas?\nSpeaker A: I prefer chicken to beef. I pair it with beef fajitas andI think it's great to have with a glass of merlot. Do you like wine?\nSpeaker B: You're making me hungry!  Yes, I do love wine.  As a matter of fact, I used to live in the Bordeaux region in France, so my favorite wine is Bordeaux wine.  But I also love champagne and cognac.\nSpeaker A: Haha, I know right? I lived in the Champagne region for a bit! Always wanted to go to Bordeaux. How was it there?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys cooking, especially making fajitas, and also volunteers at animal shelters. Speaker B is interested in trying different careers and is considering becoming a chef for Speaker A who loves Mexican food and seafood. Speaker A and Speaker B are excited about the idea of traveling the world and trying different cuisines.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Bordeaux was amazing, so many beautiful vineyards and the wine is just exquisite. It's definitely worth a visit!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information that can relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It notes Speaker A's interest in cooking and making fajitas, which parallels the conversation about asparagus and pairing it with fajitas. Both speakers' interest in traveling and trying different cuisines could also align with their discussion on food and wine. However, MEMORY does not specifically mention Speaker B's liking for wine or their experience living in the Bordeaux region, which would be directly relevant. Additionally, some information in MEMORY, such as Speaker A volunteering at animal shelters or Speaker B considering becoming a chef, is not directly connected to the current topics of discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, MEMORY provides some background relevance but lacks specific connections or causality that strongly support generating the next response based on the context of the conversation."
