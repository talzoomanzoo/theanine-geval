Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer?\nSpeaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to?\nSpeaker A: The museum has all sorts of galleries.  It has a sculpture garden outside.  I mostly like the impressionist paintings.  I like Van Gogh.  Was your concert outdoors?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys living in the city for the accessibility to food, live music, and museums. They are planning a trip to Sao Paulo and will visit the Museum of Art of São Paulo with their boyfriend next week. \nSpeaker B enjoys living in the city for the accessibility to food, live music, and drove over 1000 miles to see their favorite band, Three Dog Night.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response. It mentions Speaker A's interest in museums and live music, which relates to the current dialogue context about concerts and art museums. However, the MEMORY lacks direct causality or relevance to the specific conversation about the concert on the fourth of July or the impressionist paintings Speaker A likes. While it indicates Speaker A's general interests and plans, it does not connect strongly to the specific questions asked by Speaker A or the particular concert experience mentioned by Speaker B. More detailed and specific connections would increase the helpfulness of the MEMORY."
