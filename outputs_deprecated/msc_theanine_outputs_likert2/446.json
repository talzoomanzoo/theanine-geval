Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went to another martial arts class and had a blast.\nSpeaker B: That's great, were there a lot of students today? I've been at home working on a project.\nSpeaker A: Quite a few, but it wasn't too crowded. It was a nice change of scenery. What kind of project are you working on?\nSpeaker B: I'm sure the student appreciate that. You teach as a group as apposed to one-on-one right? And one of the companies I work for had their system hit with a virus so I've been upgraded their software to debug the system.\nSpeaker A: I teach group classes and one on one, but I was the student today. I specialize in jiu-jitsu but today I got to be the student in a taekwondo class. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is a college student who teaches jiu-jitsu and is lactose intolerant.

    "raw_prediction": "That's great that you got to experience a different style of martial arts as a student today. How was the taekwondo class compared to your usual jiu-jitsu sessions?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant context about Speaker A and Speaker B's interests and activities, which pertains to their martial arts involvement and educational pursuits. This is somewhat useful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as it establishes common ground and interests between the speakers, such as martial arts and learning. However, the information is largely repetitive and does not offer much new or contextual insight that significantly contributes to the current conversation, where Speaker B is focusing on a technical software issue. Therefore, while there is some helpful information regarding their shared interest, it does not deeply enrich the dialogue context provided."
