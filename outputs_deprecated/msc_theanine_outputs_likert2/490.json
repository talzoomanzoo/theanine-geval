Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for.\nSpeaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for?\nSpeaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\nSpeaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise? \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs. Speaker A plans to potentially visit the Columbia Trail and Ken Lockwood Gorge for a camping and hiking trip. Speaker A and Speaker B have gone hiking together before and plan to meet up for another hike. Speaker B is not in the best hiking shape and jokes about needing to recharge their energy.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about Speaker A and Speaker B's relationship and interests, which can be relevant to generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker A's recent high school graduation and their plans for a camping and hiking trip, which aligns with the casual and future-oriented tone of the conversation. Additionally, it highlights past interactions between Speaker A and Speaker B, specifically their shared hiking experience, which can be useful if the conversation takes a turn towards discussing outdoor activities or future plans. However, the memory does not directly address Speaker B's current employment situation or their thoughts on a career, which is the immediate topic of interest in the dialogue. The connection between MEMORY and the current conversation is somewhat indirect, hence the score of 3."
