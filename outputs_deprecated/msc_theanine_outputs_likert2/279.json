Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her?\nSpeaker B: Hi there, hope you are wlll and managing to save up for your Italy trip?  Thank for asking about the Greek mythology study, we are doing very well. It helps because i am so passionate about it and hope to get to the Greek islands soon\nSpeaker A: Yes I have been saving up for another trip to Italy! I can't wait. It's planned for next Spring. Do you have any plans to go back to Italy in the future?\nSpeaker B: I would love to get back to Italy but need to save up and the hopeful priority is to Greece this year.  You have friends in Europe are you in contact to see what plans you can make?\nSpeaker A: Yes I've been talking to them quite a bit so they know what's going on. I'll be staying with some of them while I'm over there. I have never been to Greece....I'd like to go though. Maybe I'll add it to my itinerary! Maybe we could plan to be in Greece at the same time?!\nSpeaker B: That would be so good.  There is so much history and the roman statues i take my daughter to see in the museums and through our local resources is fab.  She is building up the passion which is lovely to see.  Have you still got your hair blue or has it grown out now?\nSpeaker A: That's awesome! Maybe you can teach me a little about all the mythology. I think I've never liked it before only because I didn't understand it. My hair is back to being its natural brown - lol I'm being boring for the moment.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has been to Italy in the past and enjoyed the food there, while Speaker A is fascinated by the architecture of Italy and enjoys studying history, especially through reading and watching documentaries. \nSpeaker A is planning for a spring break trip and recently bought a dress for Easter, and Speaker B does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology. Speaker B enjoys Greek mythology and did a case study on Poseidon, the God of the Sea, Earthquakes, and Horses. \nSpeaker A is planning for a spring break trip and recently bought a dress for Easter, and Speaker B does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology. Speaker B appreciates the idea of superhuman powers and is interested in historical events that involve such figures.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear about your plans and your natural hair color! I'm sure you'll enjoy Greece with its rich history and mythology. Maybe we can exchange some Greek mythology stories before your trip.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly regarding Speaker B's interest in Greek mythology and their desire to visit Greece. This information can be helpful in understanding Speaker B's motivations and interests, which are reflected in the dialogue. However, certain details are either redundant, such as Speaker A's plans for a spring break trip and buying a dress for Easter, which are not directly relevant to the ongoing conversation in the dialogue. Moreover, while the MEMORY mentions Speaker B's interest in Greek mythology and history, it lacks strong connections or specific events that could enrich the dialogic interaction or enhance the grasp of the overall context. Consequently, while the MEMORY provides some useful context, it could be more organized, relevant, and directly connected to the ongoing dialogue."
