Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \nSpeaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys cooking and baking, possibly considering turning it into a business. Speaker A primarily cooks Indian food and bakes a lot of rice dishes. Speaker A owns a farm and enjoys cooking and baking. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\nSpeaker B's husband is an avid cook who enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work. Speaker B's husband is a great cook and Speaker B is not skilled in cooking. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker. Speaker B also mentions having a farm with animals like chickens, ducks, pigs, goats, and growing crops like corn, strawberries, and pumpkins.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "I would recommend starting with a simple and delicious recipe like a chicken curry or a vegetable stir-fry. It's a great way to get comfortable using the pressure cooker.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant background information that could be useful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives a clear understanding of Speaker A's interest and expertise in cooking and baking, particularly with Indian food and pressure cooking, which aligns with the discussion about beginner recipes and pressure cookers in the dialogue. It also highlights Speaker B's limited cooking skills and interest in learning, as well as her husband's proficiency in Asian cooking.\n\nWhile the MEMORY does provide relevant insights, such as Speaker A's cooking style and Speaker B's interest in using a pressure cooker, the connection between these pieces of information and the dialogue could be more tightly demonstrated. The mention of the farm and animals, although shared interests, doesn't directly relate to the immediate dialogue about cooking.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY contains helpful information that contributes to understanding the speakers' past interactions and context, but it could better connect the details with the current conversation for a more precise score of 5."
