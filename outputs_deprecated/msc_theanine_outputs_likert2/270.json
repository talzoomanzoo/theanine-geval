Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go?\nSpeaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \nSpeaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on?\nSpeaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study?\nSpeaker B: Ah, English should be easier than History. Sure, I can help you. What do you need to do exactly? Write an essay?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, we have to write an essay and we have a spelling component towards the end of the exam, I sure could use a little help!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is studying sports medicine in college, while Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring. Speaker B feels overwhelmed by their mother's strictness and looks forward to finishing school to escape it.\nSpeaker A believes that sports demonstrate how everyone can work together equally. Speaker B, who is training in sports medicine, feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother, who is in charge of the school.\nSpeaker B plays soccer and is an only child, while Speaker A hopes to improve their grades and aims for a soccer scholarship. Speaker B realizes the necessity of discussing the pressure they face with their mother.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Of course, I'd be happy to help you with studying for your English final. Just let me know when you're free to go over everything.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful background information that could inform Speaker B's responses in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives context about Speaker B's studies in sports medicine and the pressure they feel due to their mother's strictness and authority in the school. This could explain why Speaker B empathizes with Speaker A's situation with their history teacher and offers to help with studying English, as Speaker B understands academic pressure.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY could be more connected to the current dialogue. The information about Speaker B's involvement in soccer and Speaker A's aim for a scholarship could be seen as loosely related but are not directly relevant to the dialogue context. Additionally, there is no direct link or causality between the events or sentiments in MEMORY and how the conversation unfolds in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which affects its overall helpfulness."
