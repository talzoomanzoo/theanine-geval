Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons\nSpeaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use.\nSpeaker B: I am a little scared of needles though. Were your tattoos painful?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a total of 5 tattoos, one of which is dedicated to their late father. They are now planning to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest. Additionally, their favorite tattoo is the one dedicated to their late father, with the message \"for you I shall live.\"\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for the language model to generate a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives context about Speaker A having multiple tattoos and highlights a specific tattoo dedicated to their late father. This information is relevant since Speaker A mentions planning to get a new tattoo for their mother to match the one for their dad, suggesting a sentimental and meaningful approach to their tattoos. The MEMORY also provides details on Speaker Aâ€™s favorite tattoo and their plans for a new tattoo, which can be used to continue the conversation on personal experiences with tattoos and the symbolism behind them. While the MEMORY could improve by offering additional context or specificity on Speaker A's feelings towards tattoos in general (e.g., the pain aspect that Speaker B brought up), it still offers substantial relevant information connected to the current conversation. The sentences in MEMORY are logically connected, demonstrating causality and providing significant context."
