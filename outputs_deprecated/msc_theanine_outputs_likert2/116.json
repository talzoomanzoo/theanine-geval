Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok? \nSpeaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish?\nSpeaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus!\nSpeaker B: Oh that sounds absolutely fabulous. Are you going to get a free dessert, as well?\nSpeaker A: Yes, I am thinking about trying either the new eclairs, or their tres leches cake with fresh raspberry jam sauce and lemon drizzle! I have too many good options to pick from! What one would you pick?\nSpeaker B: Hands down, I would pick the tres leches. Ever since I tried it a few years ago, it has always been my favorite dessert.\nSpeaker A: Okay, I will try that! I've heard the can be made with different fruits. Did you have fruit with yours?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule. This is because Speaker A works at a restaurant and enjoys the interaction with people at work and the variety of experiences that come with it. Additionally, Speaker A gets two free meals per week at the restaurant, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, when I had the tres leches cake, it was served with fresh strawberries. I loved the combination of the moist cake and the juicy fruit. It was a perfect balance of flavors.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant background information about Speaker A's job at the restaurant, which is pertinent as the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is centered around the new dish offered at their workplace. It explains that Speaker A enjoys their job due to the interaction and the perks of getting free meals, which supports the excitement demonstrated in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY lacks a direct connection to the specific conversation about the chicken parmesan and dessert options. More specific details related to these topics would increase its helpfulness. Overall, the memory provides useful context but does not directly enhance the immediate conversation."
