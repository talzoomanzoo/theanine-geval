Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\nSpeaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call!\nSpeaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip? \nSpeaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery\nSpeaker B: Yes I think that's a great idea, how is work at the library? \nSpeaker A: Busy, and demanding because we are short staffed. While there seems to be little need for a library these days, I find that we have less staff to get everything done\nSpeaker B: Well if you ever need someone to come and help for a couple of hours here and there, give me a call, you know how much I love to be in the library anyway\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is a librarian and loves kids, mentioning having 3 children. Speaker B's mother was a librarian, which seems to have influenced their perspective on the job. Speaker A is a retired librarian who enjoys implementing creative activities in their library. \n\nSpeaker B's kids do not go to work by boat like Speaker A. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park. Speaker B took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids. \n\nSpeaker B has a lot of kids, all grown up now and with kids of their own. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park. Speaker B likes the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you, that's very kind of you to offer. I might take you up on that sometime, it would be nice to have the extra help.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides quite a bit of relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and does so in a way that is naturally connected. It helps in understanding the background of both speakers, which is relevant for generating further dialogue responses. For example, it reinforces Speaker A's identity as a librarian and their love for kids, and provides details about Speaker B's perspective on libraries due to their mother's influence. It also elaborates on Speaker B's relationship with their grandkids, supporting their ability to plan an annual fishing trip. However, some information, like the fact that Speaker A's kids donâ€™t go to work by boat, is not directly relevant to the current dialogue. Overall, the MEMORY is mostly helpful, with a clear connection and relevance to their discussion, but could be improved by focusing more on directly relevant and evolving aspects of the conversation."
