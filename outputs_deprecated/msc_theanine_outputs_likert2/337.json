Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it! Thank you for the recommendation.\nSpeaker B: Of course. I recommend that movie to everyone I meet. I think I've watched it over one hundred times. So what is the next movie on your list to watch soon?\nSpeaker A: Yeah it was great and I will also recommend to people when they ask what movie is good. So next is another one you recommended which is coming to America. What’s the next movie your going to watch? \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is interested in watching movies, mentioned Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman. Speaker B enjoys watching suspense films, action, SF, horror, westerns, drama, and occasional good comedy. Speaker B is knowledgeable about movies and provides recommendations based on Speaker A's preferences.\nSpeaker A enjoyed the movie \"Coming to America\" and expressed interest in watching its sequel.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains useful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It correctly identifies that Speaker A is interested in watching movies and has previously mentioned Pulp Fiction, which aligns with the context where Speaker A thanks Speaker B for recommending it. Furthermore, the MEMORY notes that Speaker B is knowledgeable about movies and provides recommendations according to Speaker A's preferences, relevant because Speaker A is considering watching another recommended movie, \"Coming to America.\" However, the MEMORY mistakenly states that Speaker A enjoyed the movie \"Coming to America,\" which hasn't been watched yet according to the dialogue context. This discrepancy slightly lowers the helpfulness score, but overall, the MEMORY provides valuable insights that assist in crafting a connected and relevant response by Speaker B."
