Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read.\nSpeaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting? \nSpeaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far.\nSpeaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes. \nSpeaker A: why don't you like books like that?\nSpeaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading?\nSpeaker A: Not yet.  I think Netflix is going to make it into a movie soon.  They might finally convince me to pay for a subscription haha.\nSpeaker B: Well if it's any good I know you'll be watching the whole thing.\nSpeaker A: you know it.  And I know that you would just fall asleep during it whether it's any good or not.\nSpeaker B: Is there a lot of violence in your book? I couldn't stand to read it if there was. \nSpeaker A: There's a little bit.  Mostly just when describing how the crimes occurred though.  There are also some fight scenes between the cops and the criminals.  It's not too bad.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B enjoys reading books about animals. Speaker A watches Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars after running out of things to watch.\n2. Speaker B has a son and enjoys reading books about animals. Speaker B is looking forward to having more time to themselves once their son starts preschool next year. Speaker B wants to volunteer at an animal shelter when her son starts school.\n3. Speaker A has 8 grandchildren and enjoys reading books and watching Netflix. Speaker B is a mother to a son who is going to start going to school soon, which causes Speaker B to plan to buy school supplies and check local stores or order online.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains some information that is relevant and could be helpful in generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is not particularly strong in demonstrating causality or relevance. \n\n1. Memory sentence 1 mentions Speaker B's preference for animal books, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B expresses a preference for animal books over crime dramas. This particular detail is relevant and helpful.\n2. In memory sentence 2, information about Speaker B's anticipation for more personal time when their son starts preschool is included. Although this detail is about Speaker B's life, it is not particularly tied to the current conversation about books and movies.\n3. Memory sentence 3 describes Speaker A having 8 grandchildren and interests in books and Netflix. While Speaker A's love for books is evident in the context, the number of grandchildren and details about school supplies are not relevant to generating the next response in the conversation. \n\nOverall, while the MEMORY contributes some relevant information, it could be more tightly connected to the ongoing dialogue to provide clearer context and helpfulness."
