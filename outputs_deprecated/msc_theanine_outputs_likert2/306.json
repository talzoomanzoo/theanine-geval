Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, an inventor working on a teleportation machine and a time machine, is currently focused on developing renewable energy sources for their inventions. This change in focus leads Speaker B to mention weight gain from spending time at the computer and express plans to work in the garden more. As a result, Speaker B wants to become more knowledgeable about plants and gardening, aiming to have a thriving garden.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great! I'd be happy to help you with gardening tips and suggestions. What kind of plants are you thinking of growing in your garden?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker B's interest in working in the garden more and becoming knowledgeable about plants and gardening, which directly relates to Speaker A's request for gardening suggestions. This shows a connection between the past interaction (Speaker B's intentions about gardening) and the present dialogue (Speaker A seeking advice). However, the part about working on renewable energy and machines is not particularly relevant to the current gardening discussion, which slightly reduces the overall helpfulness. Nonetheless, the MEMORY overall helps in understanding Speaker B's motivation and interest in gardening, making it mostly relevant."
