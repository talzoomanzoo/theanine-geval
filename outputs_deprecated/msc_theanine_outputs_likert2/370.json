Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains a lot of repetitive information about past discussions between Speaker A and Speaker B regarding their hobbies and interests. Most of the details, such as Speaker A enjoying gardening and reading, and Speaker B visiting the zoo, along with his girlfriend's interests and their frequent zoo visits, do not directly relate to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about potentially adopting a kitten and vacation plans. \n\nThe only relevant piece of information in the MEMORY is that Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten from a friend, but this is repeated multiple times and adds little substance overall. The repetition and unrelated details fail to form a coherent or naturally connected narrative relevant to the ongoing conversation, which limits its usefulness in generating a meaningful response."
