Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did you decide to become a therapist?\nSpeaker B: I've always loved the thought of helping people, and I love to listen and talk to people, so for me it always seemed like a perfect job!\nSpeaker A: That sounds really great. Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\nSpeaker B: People can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient! \nSpeaker A: Wow, that gives me a completely different perspective. You'd really be ok with seeing me? You don't think it would be a conflict of interest since we're friends?\nSpeaker B: No not at all but if you didn't feel comfortable talking to me I can recommend a couple of my colleagues who are just as brilliant\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has a passion for horse breeding and taking care of horses, working at a stable and enjoying being around them.\nSpeaker B, living in the city, is interested in having a horse in the future and considers the psychological aspects of owning one, relating it to Freudian theories.\nSpeaker B's profession as a therapist is influenced by their mom being a busy nurse, causing them to discuss the challenges and rewards of being a therapist and the restrictions on relationships with clients.\nSpeaker B, a therapist and a football fan supporting the Chiefs, reflects on the profession's ups and downs, while Speaker A mentions the potential medical costs of horses hurting themselves during exercise.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate the offer, and I'll definitely think about it. It's good to know that therapy can have an endpoint for some people.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for the language model to generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is not optimally connected or fully relevant. \n\n- The MEMORY mentions Speaker B's profession as a therapist and the challenges and rewards of the job, which aligns with the dialogue's focus on Speaker B's role and their perspective on therapy. \n- It also touches on the restrictions on relationships with clients, which could indirectly relate to the conversation about potential therapy sessions between friends (Speaker A and B).\n- Speaker A's passion for horses is relevant as it was mentioned in the dialogue (\"find therapy in riding my horses\") and connects to the conversation about personal therapies.\n  \nHowever, some parts of the MEMORY seem less connected or unnecessary for this specific dialogue context, such as Speaker B considering owning a horse in the future based on psychological theories and reflections on medical costs of horses, which aren't directly discussed in the dialogue. There is also no mention currently in the dialogue about Speaker B's mom or the Chiefs, which makes those points less relevant or helpful for generating a next response. \n\nOverall, although the MEMORY contains relevant elements that align with certain aspects of the dialogue, its content and structure could be more focused to better support the generation of a natural and contextually relevant response."
