Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for.\nSpeaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for?\nSpeaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys camping, hiking, and is kind, caring, and hopeful for group equality. Speaker A plans to potentially visit the Columbia Trail and Ken Lockwood Gorge for a camping and hiking trip. Speaker A applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail.\nSpeaker B does not vote and wants their neighbor John to know about their stance on group equality. Speaker B's neighbor, John, is getting divorced and selling top-of-the-line camping gear. Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.\nSpeaker A is a recent high school graduate, shy, and on a cross-country journey looking for jobs. Speaker A plans to potentially visit the Columbia Trail and Ken Lockwood Gorge for a camping and hiking trip. Speaker A plans to leave a hammock by the river for anyone to use at a hidden spot off the main hiking trail. There is a lake at the hiking trail, and Speaker A suggests swimming in it, warning that the water may be cold.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for Speaker B to generate a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It offers context about their mutual interests in outdoor activities, particularly hiking and camping, which could serve as a basis for Speaker B to relate to Speaker A's enthusiasm for the location of their new job. Additionally, the MEMORY contains seemingly relevant details, such as Speaker B having a friend who worked at the same store and found the people there enjoyable, which aligns with Speaker A's positive impression of the store staff. However, the MEMORY also contains extraneous information about Speaker B's political beliefs, their neighbor's marital situation, and Speaker A's future hiking plans, which may not be immediately useful or contextually relevant to generating the next response in this specific conversation. The information's connection and causal relationship to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT are somewhat fragmented, reducing its overall helpfulness."
