Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?\nSpeaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping?\nSpeaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities. Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys. Speaker A is offering advice and seems to have experience with children. \n\nSpeaker A compares having a kitten to being a grandparent and mentions starting their own zoo. Speaker B expresses concern about leaving a kitten alone during their family camping adventures. \n\nSpeaker A suggests taking the pets to the zoo and mentions that most major cities have good zoos. Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nThe MEMORY provided does not offer relevant or helpful information for generating Speaker B's next response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context is focused on camping and does not mention the zoo, which is a recurring topic in the MEMORY. Additionally, the MEMORY is disjointed, with no clear causality or connection to camping, which limits its helpfulness for generating a natural continuation of the conversation about camping preferences."
