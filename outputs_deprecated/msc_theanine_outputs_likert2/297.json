Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods.\nSpeaker B: Oh that sounds fun! What is it about?\nSpeaker A: Black Widow is one of the character in the Marvel Avengers movies. Like Thor and Captain America. Have you seen any of those movies?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys hot latina salsa and mentioned it while talking about Brazilian foods with their brother.\nSpeaker B prefers to keep holidays local with their brother instead of having big family gatherings, after expressing interest in trying healing methods mentioned by Speaker A.\nSpeaker A enjoys salsa dancing and is planning to go out dancing, which causes Speaker B to express interest in trying healing methods mentioned by Speaker A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY contains some potentially relevant information, such as Speaker A's interest in salsa and their mention of Brazilian foods, which ties back to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A talks about enjoying Brazilian foods. However, MEMORY also introduces details that are disconnected or irrelevant to the current context, like Speaker B's preference for local holidays and interest in healing methods. The connections between these memories and the present dialogue context are weak, as they don't strongly relate to the conversation about the Black Widow movie or specifically aid Speaker B in generating an appropriate response. The causality and relevancy of events in MEMORY are not clearly demonstrated in relation to the current dialogue."
