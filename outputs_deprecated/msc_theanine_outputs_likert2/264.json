Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go?\nSpeaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B is dedicated to studying sports medicine on the way to college, resulting in all A's in the sports medicine class, while Speaker A struggles with maintaining good grades and excels only in gym.\n2. Speaker B is focused on sports medicine training and is preparing for an exam in that subject, feeling pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother who runs the school.\n3. Speaker B is studying sports medicine in college, while Speaker A finds history class boring and challenging, both feeling overwhelmed by external pressures and expectations.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Nice job on getting a B! Studying more always helps. Just keep pushing through, you got this.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful context regarding Speaker B's academic situation, mentioning their dedication to sports medicine and the pressure to maintain straight A's, which may be relevant to Speaker B's current preparation for upcoming exams as mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY focuses heavily on Speaker B's sports medicine studies, which isn't directly relevant to the immediate context of preparing for multiple exams or discussing a history exam. Additionally, the MEMORY includes information about Speaker A, which is less pertinent to crafting a response for Speaker B in this scenario. Overall, the MEMORY contains some relevant information but could be more directly connected to the specific exams and academic pressures discussed in the dialogue context."
