Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy playing video games in their free time. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil. Speaker B mentions that Resident Evil can be scary and provides some tips for playing it. Speaker B is interested in playing Jurassic Park: World but has not played it yet. Speaker B is interested in trying the Jurassic Park game.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides several useful pieces of information that can help Speaker B generate a response. It confirms that Speaker B plays video games and recently acquired Resident Evil VIII, which aligns with the topic of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Moreover, the MEMORY clarifies that both Speaker A and B have a shared interest in gaming and plan to play games together, which gives relevant background for any potential suggestions or insights they might exchange about Resident Evil. Additionally, the MEMORY mentions that Speaker B finds Resident Evil potentially scary and has given tips for playing it, which could be topical for discussing gameplay experiences. However, the MEMORY contains some extraneous information regarding Speaker B's interest in a Jurassic Park game, which is not directly related to the current dialogue topic and may not provide immediate useful context. Despite this, the MEMORY is largely cohesive and well-connected."
