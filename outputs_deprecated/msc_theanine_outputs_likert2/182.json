Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know. \nSpeaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like.\nSpeaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too.\nSpeaker B: Nice! Is anyone coming with you?\nSpeaker A: Just my doggy Drunky.  You never know,  I might meet a nice lady out there. \nSpeaker B: Totally.  There will be a bunch of women there and it'll be easy to strike up conversations.  Just be confident and I'm sure you could walk away with a bunch of numbers.\nSpeaker A: Oh, I definitely will. Thanks for the motivation. Is this going to me your first festival?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys Mexican food and drinks, and plays music for fun. Speaker A enjoys going to bars and loves the ladies. Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n\nSpeaker B is a mechanic who enjoys working on cars. Speaker B is not going out drinking much due to their wife's pregnancy. Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day. Speaker B's wife is pregnant and has three more months to go until the due date.\n\nSpeaker A owns a Subaru Legacy and mentions having a baby on the way. Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "No, I've been to a few festivals before, but this will be the first one with a baby on the way.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information that is helpful for generating a proper response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It indicates that Speaker A enjoys music and going out, which aligns well with Speaker A's interest in attending the festival and possibly meeting new people. The MEMORY also notes that Speaker B has a wife who is pregnant, which may influence their participation in the festival, as discussed in the context. Additionally, the MEMORY points out that both speakers enjoy bluegrass music, which is contextually relevant since the conversation revolves around attending a bluegrass festival. However, some details, like Speaker A mentioning having a baby on the way, are not directly discussed in the context and don't seem to have an immediate connection to the current dialogue. Despite this, the MEMORY maintains enough relevance and causality to support the conversation, hence not scoring a full 5."
