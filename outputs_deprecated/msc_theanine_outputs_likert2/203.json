Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college?\nSpeaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position. \nSpeaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it?\nSpeaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \nSpeaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living.\nSpeaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime?\nSpeaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket but now plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week. Speaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United. \nSpeaker A enjoys playing soccer and joked about treating Speaker B to lunch, indicating Speaker B is currently low on cash. Speaker B is considering asking for a raise at work and works as a clerk for a law firm, enjoying the work but wishing it paid better.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides useful context for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes some background information about both speakers' interest in soccer, which is relevant to the ongoing conversation about soccer roles and activities. Although the detail about Speaker A working part-time at a supermarket and the joke about lunch are not immediately pertinent, they do add depth to Speaker A's character, showing a friendly rapport between the speakers. The mention of Speaker B's affinity for Manchester United and desire to re-engage with playing soccer ties nicely with the dialogue where they consider casual soccer meetups. However, some information about Speaker B's job concerns is not directly related to the soccer conversation, diluting the overall relevance slightly. The memory provides several useful points to inform a response, hence a score of 4."
