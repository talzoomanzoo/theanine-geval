Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college?\nSpeaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position. \nSpeaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it?\nSpeaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \nSpeaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living.\nSpeaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime?\nSpeaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with.\nSpeaker A: Sounds great! Now the tough question: when do you have time?\nSpeaker B: It would have to be sometime when I'm off work, maybe on the weekend. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket and is a member of a soccer team, enjoying playing in tournaments. \nSpeaker A played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United. \nSpeaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week, being a fan of Arsenal and enjoying watching international teams play.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that may be helpful for generating a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives background about Speaker A's connection to soccer, which is pertinent given the discussion about playing soccer and potentially playing again with Speaker B. The MEMORY states that Speaker A is a member of a soccer team, plays as a striker, and enjoys playing in tournaments. This information adds context to Speaker A's enthusiasm about playing and can be used to support and inform their engagement in the proposed activity. However, the sentences in the MEMORY aren't strongly connected in terms of causality or a cohesive narrative, as it primarily lists facts without clearly showing how they relate or led to the current conversation."
