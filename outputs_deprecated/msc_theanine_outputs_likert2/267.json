Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How did the exam go?\nSpeaker B: Well, I have a few coming up. It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \nSpeaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is studying sports medicine in college, which causes Speaker A to wish for better grades and hope for a soccer scholarship. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and excels only in gym class.\n\nSpeaker B, who is studying sports medicine in college, finds history class boring just like Speaker A. Both of them are dealing with the challenges of school. Speaker B, feeling overwhelmed by their mother's strictness, is eager to finish school to escape it.\n\nSpeaker B's dedication to studying sports medicine in college has resulted in getting all A's in the class. This success puts pressure on Speaker B to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother, who happens to run the school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some relevant context for Speaker B's academic life, particularly their dedication to studying sports medicine and the pressures they face due to their mother's expectations. This information could be helpful for understanding Speaker B's perspective in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically regarding their upcoming finals and the difficulties they face in school. However, the MEMORY also includes details about Speaker A's wish for a soccer scholarship and excel in gym class, which are not directly relevant to the current dialogue about exams and might not contribute significantly to generating a next response. Additionally, some parts of MEMORY, such as Speaker B finding history class boring, have a weak connection to the conversation. Thus, the MEMORY is somewhat fragmented in terms of relevancy and natural progression but contains useful context about Speaker B."
