Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?\nSpeaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping?\nSpeaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp?\nSpeaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer?\nSpeaker A: I've only camped in a tent so far, but would like to try out a camper trailer. What do use for camping?\nSpeaker B: We usually do tents but we have camped in yurts too. Did you go to the zoo last weekend?\nSpeaker A: I see. Yes, I did make it to the zoo.  Have you gone to your local zoo?\nSpeaker B: I went to the Bronx zoo it was amazing! Did you get to see Joshua?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A, who enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities, suggests taking the pets to the zoo and mentions that most major cities have good zoos. Speaker B, interested in finding family discounts for the zoo, wants to take their daughter's school on a field trip to the zoo.\nSpeaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys, which is the same topic where Speaker A mentions taking the pets to the zoo. Speaker B's daughter likes monkeys and is starting to assert her independence.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about both speakers' interest in zoos, which ties into the zoo topic mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY is not clearly structured to show the full development of events and interactions between the speakers. Although it highlights Speaker A's interest in visiting the zoo, there is less emphasis on Speaker B's overall camping experience or their specific past conversations on this topic. The mention of Speaker A's regular zoo visits and love for certain animals offers some useful context to generate responses related to zoos, but the connection to the current conversation isn't very strong. Moreover, the MEMORY mixes information about zoos and pets, and the family-related aspects could be clearer for more coherent and helpful context continuity."
