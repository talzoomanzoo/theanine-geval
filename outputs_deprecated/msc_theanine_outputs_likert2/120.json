Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty excited! They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok? \nSpeaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish?\nSpeaker A: It's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus!\nSpeaker B: Oh that sounds absolutely fabulous. Are you going to get a free dessert, as well?\nSpeaker A: Yes, I am thinking about trying either the new eclairs, or their tres leches cake with fresh raspberry jam sauce and lemon drizzle! I have too many good options to pick from! What one would you pick?\nSpeaker B: Hands down, I would pick the tres leches. Ever since I tried it a few years ago, it has always been my favorite dessert.\nSpeaker A: Okay, I will try that! I've heard the can be made with different fruits. Did you have fruit with yours?\nSpeaker B: I like it best with fresh strawberries. And then it is even better with some fresh whipped cream and chocolate drizzle. Just thinking about it is making me want to have some right now!\nSpeaker A: Ooh, that sounds delicious! It's a rich and moist cake, so I don't think it should have too much chocolate. I've seen brown sugar and caramel versions too!\nSpeaker B: Oh I've never seen that version. That sounds scrumptuous. Tonight I'm going to bake some oatmeal raisin cookies.\nSpeaker A: That sounds great! I love a good oatmeal raisin cookie with the right amount of cinnamon! My brothers don't like them though, haha. They call them the \"vegetable of cookies\" :)\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is interested in going rock climbing with Speaker A. Speaker A enjoys the interaction with people at work and the variety of experiences that come with it. Speaker A works at a restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\nSpeaker A works at a restaurant and invited Speaker B to visit. Speaker A owns a restaurant and recently experienced a fire incident but managed to put it out. Speaker A is a restaurant worker who enjoys working there but finds it very busy. Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Haha, that's a funny way to describe oatmeal raisin cookies! Everyone has their own tastes.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information, like Speaker A working at a restaurant and getting free meals, which connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about trying a new dish at work. However, much of the MEMORY content is not directly relevant to the current context, such as the interests in rock climbing or the fire incident, and it is somewhat redundant with repeated points about Speaker A's enjoyment of work and interactions. The lack of clear, specific connections and causality between events in the MEMORY and the current dialogue limits its helpfulness in generating responses."
