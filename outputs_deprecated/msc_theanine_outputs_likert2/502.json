Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive.\nSpeaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price?\nSpeaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music\nSpeaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it.\nSpeaker A: I'll keep trying! Have you had any luck lately?\nSpeaker B: No I haven't! I keep hoping that I will so I can buy my dreamhouse but I know the chances are low.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B have a friendly interaction and part ways on a positive note. They discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\n\nSpeaker A and Speaker B have a friendly interaction and part ways on a positive note. They both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n\nSpeaker A, who has never been to college and values the peaceful life of working on the farm, suggests that Speaker B and their family could stay over at the farm after the concert. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\n\nSpeaker A, who has never been to college and values the peaceful life of working on the farm, is open to moving to the country to be further away from neighbors. Speaker B, in turn, bought 20 lotto tickets with the same numbers, aiming to get a bigger share of the jackpot if they win.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some potentially useful information that could be incorporated into the current dialogue context, particularly regarding the discussion of lottery strategies and potential outcomes. This could help Speaker A continue the conversation about the lottery with Speaker B. However, the MEMORY includes extraneous information such as details about Speaker A's lifestyle and college background, which are not directly relevant to the ongoing conversation about the iPhone and lottery. Additionally, the MEMORY entries are somewhat repetitive and disjointed, leading to a lack of natural flow and causality between them, which reduces their helpfulness in generating a coherent response."
