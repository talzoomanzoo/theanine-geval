Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \nSpeaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with?\nSpeaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B lives in a rural area with a farm and can relate to cooking. Speaker B's husband is a great cook and enjoys making Asian food with lots of prep work. \nSpeaker B lives in a rural area with a farm and can relate to cooking. Speaker A is interested in running a business with their cooking skills. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker. \nSpeaker B lives in a rural area with a farm and can relate to cooking. Speaker B also mentions having a farm with animals like chickens, ducks, pigs, goats, and growing crops like corn, strawberries, and pumpkins. Speaker A owns a farm and enjoys cooking and baking. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "raw_prediction": "Yes, shrimp fried rice typically includes eggs. That's perfect since you have your own fresh eggs from your farm. It's great to use ingredients you already have on hand.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful insight into the background and interests of both Speaker A and Speaker B that can aid in generating a relevant response. Notably, Speaker B's interest in cooking, the fact that her husband enjoys making Asian food, and that they have access to fresh eggs due to owning chickens are relevant to the current conversation about recipes. However, the MEMORY contains some repetitive information about Speaker B living in a rural area and having a farm. Additionally, there is some extraneous information included about Speaker A that doesn't directly connect to the current conversation's topics, such as Speaker A's interest in running a business with their cooking skills, which might not be as helpful. Overall, the MEMORY provides a mixed level of relevancy, contributing helpful context but also including repetitive and slightly irrelevant details."
