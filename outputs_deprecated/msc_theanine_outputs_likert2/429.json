Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: How are your pet snakes doing?\nSpeaker B: Not too bad. One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha!\nSpeaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes?\nSpeaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe. \nSpeaker A: You make them sounds so fascinating. Will you take them with you to your college dorm? \nSpeaker B: I'll be living off campus, so absolutely. How about you? Are you staying in the dorms?\nSpeaker A: I'm glad your taking them with you. My mum wants me to stay in dorms. But I think I just want my own place, less drama and more freedom that way.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is a student planning to go to college next year and wants to study neuroscience. Speaker B mentions studying Neuroscience classes next year, hinting at being a student. Speaker A plans to work with humans in neuroscience to help cure neurological diseases. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies. \nSpeaker A is working on becoming an Eagle Scout and volunteers at a research lab. Speaker B mentions studying Neuroscience classes next year, hinting at being a student. Speaker B is excited about taking neuroscience classes next year. Speaker B's classes related to neuroscience will start next year. \nSpeaker B recently divorced their wife and loves to scuba dive in Hawaii when not working. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "Living off campus does sound like a great way to have your own space. Plus, you can have your snakes with you!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains several pieces of information about Speaker A and Speaker B, some of which are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, MEMORY mentions that Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel, which aligns with the context about snakes being low maintenance and Speaker B's enthusiasm for reptiles. However, there is repetitive information about Speaker A's and Speaker B's plans to study neuroscience and Speaker A's volunteer work, which does not directly contribute to the specific dialogue focused on Speaker B's snakes and college housing plans. Additionally, while there is some relevant information, the memory lacks a strong narrative or causal connection between the past interactions and the current conversation, detracting from its overall helpfulness."
