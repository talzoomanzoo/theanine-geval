Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay I made a playlist for our meetup this weekend. It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B, who does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies, reacted positively when Speaker A offered to teach them how to swim and programming. Speaker A's plan to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination changed as they signed up for several trips. This led to Speaker A planning a snorkeling trip and looking forward to traveling to the Caribbean for their next trip. Additionally, Speaker B expressed their enjoyment of cruising in their car while listening to punk music, which sparked a conversation about the potential of Speaker A and Speaker B getting on a cruise ship together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I'll definitely let you know how it goes. It's going to be a fantastic experience for sure.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information that could potentially help Speaker A in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights the connection that Speaker B does not know how to swim and their openness to learning from Speaker A, which is relevant to the conversation about swimming lessons and future cruises. It also captures Speaker A's excitement about the Caribbean trip and Speaker B's interest in potentially joining. However, there are discrepancies, such as the mention of programming, snorkeling plans, and past trips that were not addressed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Although these points offer some context, they do not align seamlessly, and the structure could be improved for coherence. Overall, the MEMORY provides a mix of relevant and partly irrelevant information, with some lack of natural connection between events."
