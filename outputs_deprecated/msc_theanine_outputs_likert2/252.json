Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\nSpeaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A has recently received a call for a job interview and is excited about it. Speaker A wants to pursue a career in producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them. Speaker B creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\nSpeaker B mentioned taking a nap during work and is not entirely satisfied with their job, wishing it was more rewarding. Speaker B has a government job that pays the bills but wishes they could work in interior design.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear that producing horror movies is more enjoyable for you! It's important to pursue what you're passionate about. Have you considered exploring more opportunities within the film industry to further develop your skills and interests?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but lacks clarity in showing the natural development of events or causal connections. Speaker B's enthusiasm for producing horror movies is confirmed in both the MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which helps support the ongoing conversation about creative careers. However, there are inconsistencies, such as the MEMORY mentioning Speaker B's interest in interior design, which contradicts them dismissing it as not a good fit in the context. Additionally, while Speaker A's excitement about a job interview and interest in horror movies could inform potential dialogue, these aspects aren't directly addressed or connected in the current conversation. The MEMORY isn't completely unhelpful; it aligns partially with the conversation but lacks comprehensive causality or continuity."
