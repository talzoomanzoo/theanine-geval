    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week?\nSpeaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you?\nSpeaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions?\nSpeaker B: Unfortunately I mainly play games similar to RE. I don't know why I like them so much. I remember when I was little my brother play Doom and it gave me nightmares for a week. What genre of games you like?\nSpeaker A: I like all kinds of games. I like party, fighting, RPGs, shooters, action, adventure, and puzzle games. I enjoy playing Jurassic Park: World but I'd like to find another game to play. The storm means I'll be inside for a bit, so I think I'll curl up with some pizza and just zone out. Do you like to do anything else besides game when it's rainy?\nSpeaker B: Well, I might help around the house with cleaning or laundry, but not that much. Mostly gaming. If I feel I sat too long, I'll switch to Nintendo Switch's Ring Fit Adventure to get my body moving a bit. Do yo know that game?\nSpeaker A: I've heard of it. I think I need to get some exercise, so that might be a good idea. I'd like to stay in shape as much as I can. I guess games are the best way to do that! That's a good suggestion. How about you? Do you only like games like RE? What other genres do you like?\nSpeaker B: I like fighting too, but not RPG types. I tried racing games before, but clearly not good at it so I'm not enjoying them that much. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker B and Speaker A both enjoy playing video games in their free time. They plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\n2. Speaker A prefers tamer video games and is not a fan of horror movies. Despite being hesitant to try playing Resident Evil, Speaker A enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World. Speaker B is interested in trying the Jurassic Park game.\n3. Speaker B enjoys playing video games, specifically League of Legends and recently bought Resident Evil VIII. This change makes Speaker A hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World, mentioning its lack of multiplayer and outdated graphics.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I understand, racing games can be tricky. Have you ever tried playing any sports games? They can be a fun way to mix things up.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information regarding Speaker A and Speaker B's gaming interests, which can be useful for generating a response. For example, it notes Speaker A's preference for tamer games and mentions Jurassic Park: World, which appears in the dialogue. It also highlights Speaker B's enjoyment of games and mentions their purchase of Resident Evil VIII. However, the MEMORY is not particularly well-structured as it includes some irrelevant or repetitive details, such as the outdated information that Speaker B recently bought Resident Evil VIII, which is not mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the MEMORY contains information about Speaker A's supposed plan to try Resident Evil, which does not align with the context, creating potential confusion for generating a coherent response. Therefore, while the MEMORY includes some helpful elements, it lacks clarity and precision, revealing connections in the current dialogue."
