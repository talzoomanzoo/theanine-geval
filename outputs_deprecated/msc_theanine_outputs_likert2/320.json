Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company? Do you build computers or work on programming?\nSpeaker B: I do like my job. My job is to troubleshoot issues between the hardware and software, so I get to work with both.\nSpeaker A: That sounds interesting. That's great that you love your job, not many people do.\nSpeaker B: Love is a strong word! I do like it though. There have been jobs I hated and I'm great full not be in that place. Hows you job going?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys reading books about ice cream, Disney World, and computers, and is open to meeting for lunch and is flexible with food choices. \nSpeaker A is considering a career in dentistry but is also interested in working at Disney for happiness, and is open to meeting for lunch and is flexible with food choices. \nSpeaker A works for a small local business with a demanding schedule, which hinders them, but is open to meeting for lunch and is flexible with food choices.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information about Speaker A's interests and current job situation, which could indirectly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT since both speakers discuss their jobs. However, the details in the MEMORY (such as reading preferences, interest in Disney, and lunch flexibility) are not directly relevant to the ongoing dialogue about Speaker B's job and particularly the aspect of loving or hating jobs. There is a lack of causal or relevant connections between the MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, and the MEMORY seems more focused on unrelated personal preferences rather than job-related experiences or opinions. Therefore, it only vaguely supports generating a meaningful response in the context provided."
