Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: The portrait you ordered is coming along swimmingly! How are the little furries doing?\nSpeaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from?\nSpeaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there.\nSpeaker B: That's great. I have gotten my pets from the shelter and they seem happy I brought them home. I have a hard time saying no to them which is why I have so many pets. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs. Do you have a name in mind for your cat? \nSpeaker A: I've thought of a lot of  names, but in the end it will probably depend on the breed and the sex.  \nSpeaker B: That's true. Is pilates hard? I've always wanted to try it but I don't know if it will be too difficult.\nSpeaker A: No, I don't think it's hard.  I actually enjoy it.  It's more fun than work, at least to me. You should give it a try!\nSpeaker B: Maybe I will. Do you think I can start at home by watching Youtube videos, or do I need to go to a Pilates class?\nSpeaker A: You can probably start with Youtube just to see if you like it.  Much better to go to a class I think though.  Of course, I'm biased. I'm in love with my instructor! haha\nSpeaker B: Lol, okay I will definitely try it at home first. If I can get the hang of it, I will sign up for a class. Hopefully I can get an instructor as good as yours lol! \nSpeaker A: Well, getting some individual responses to questions and individual attention at times, I think makes a difference. But there is nothing wrong with going to youtube first!  I did!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has 5 dogs of different breeds, has rats as pets, and thinks pit bulls are lovely.\nSpeaker B discovered love for portraits through a self-portrait with pets and prefers painting regular people over professionals.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "I'll give it a shot and see how it goes. Who knows, maybe I'll end up loving Pilates just like you!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant and useful information for a potential continuation of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker B's love for portraits and pets, which directly connects with the ongoing conversation about painting portraits of pets. The MEMORY mentions Speaker B's experience with multiple pets, which aligns with the dialogue's mention of the number of pets Speaker B has. However, MEMORY could be improved by explicitly tying Speaker B's love for portrait painting to the current discussion about trying pilates, which is not directly connected in the current dialogue. Overall, the information is connected, but some linkage or more specific causality between portrait painting and the pilates conversation is slightly lacking."
