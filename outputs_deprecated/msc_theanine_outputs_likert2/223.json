Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself!\nSpeaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food?\nSpeaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too?\nSpeaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also?\nSpeaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways?\nSpeaker B: They've been better as I left my previous job so I'm spending more time with them, how do you manage to work full time and still keep those animals happy?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A works as a zookeeper and loves animals, especially white tigers. Speaker A works at a zoo and has tried playing music for the white tigers and home concerts for their pets. Speaker B is looking for a new job and is excited about the opportunity at the zoo. Speaker B has elderly terriers and is planning to leave their part-time job for a break before starting a new one. \n\nSpeaker B has two terrier dogs as pets. Speaker A has penguins at the zoo and enjoys working with animals, offering Speaker B a chance to help out. Speaker A mentions having dogs and Speaker B admires them for their peaceful nature. Speaker B asks Speaker A if they have had a pet raccoon before. \n\nSpeaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid. Speaker A has a pet raccoon and has a friend who found baby raccoons.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides pertinent information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly on the animals being discussed, such as Journey the pet raccoon and Sid the bearded dragon. This information helps in understanding the context of the conversation about pets and their behaviors regarding food. It also gives background on Speaker A's profession and their affection for animals, which is relevant to the ongoing dialogue about managing pets while working full-time. Speaker B's transition in jobs and their time with their terriers provide additional context that could influence their responses. The MEMORY contains naturally connected sentences, establishing relationships and relevancies between the events and conversations. However, slight redundancy and mixed information regarding Speaker B's job transitions and affinity for zoo opportunities could be more closely related to the immediate conversation."
