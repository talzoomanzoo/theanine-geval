Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \nSpeaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with?\nSpeaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point.\nSpeaker A: Yes, it contains eggs.  I think you would do well with the fried rice. It's best to cook the rice the day before.  \nSpeaker B: I didn't know that. Why cook the rice beforehand? Is it better to age rice or something?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B lives in a rural area with a farm and can relate to cooking. Speaker A enjoys cooking and baking, possibly considering turning it into a business. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker.\nSpeaker A enjoys cooking and baking, possibly considering turning it into a business. Speaker B's husband is a great cook and Speaker B is not skilled in cooking. Speaker A primarily cooks Indian food and bakes a lot of rice dishes. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Cooking the rice beforehand helps to dry it out slightly, resulting in better texture and preventing it from becoming mushy in the fried rice. It's a little trick to achieve that perfect fried rice consistency.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some pieces of relevant background information that could aid Speaker A in generating a response. Specifically, it informs us that Speaker B is not skilled in cooking but is interested in learning, which aligns with the current context of Speaker B asking questions about cooking rice. Additionally, Speaker A's enjoyment of cooking, baking, and using a pressure cooker aligns with the recommendations being given, such as the shrimp fried rice recipe, and suggests they could provide more advice or recipes in this particular domain. However, parts of the MEMORY could be more directly relevant or better connected to the current dialogue context to enhance its helpfulness, such as the information regarding Speaker A's potential business interest or Speaker B's rural living situation, which doesn't directly tie into the immediate conversation. The MEMORY lacks a clear causality or development between past interactions that can drive the context further."
