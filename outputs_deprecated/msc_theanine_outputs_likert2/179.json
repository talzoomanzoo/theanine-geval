Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know. \nSpeaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like.\nSpeaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too.\nSpeaker B: Nice! Is anyone coming with you?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A enjoys Mexican food and drinks, and plays music for fun. This leads Speaker A to frequent live band venues and play music at home. Additionally, Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy bluegrass music.\n\n2. Speaker A owns a Subaru Legacy and mentions having a baby on the way, causing Speaker B's wife to be pregnant and currently in the second trimester while still working. Speaker B's wife being pregnant makes them want to consider attending a local festival for just a day. In the same vein, Speaker A is unsure if they will ever settle down with a partner and have kids.\n\n3. Speaker A enjoying Mexican food and drinks, and playing music for fun, causes Speaker B to feel a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy. This leads to Speaker A and Speaker B discussing the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some background information on Speaker A and Speaker B, such as their shared interest in bluegrass music and Speaker A's lifestyle preferences. However, the MEMORY contains several inaccuracies and irrelevant details which reduce its overall helpfulness. For instance, it incorrectly states Speaker A is unsure about settling down and having children, which contradicts the notion that Speaker B's wife is pregnant due to Speaker A's baby on the way. Furthermore, the logical flow of past interactions isn't cohesively represented, with disjointed and contradictory causality between events, such as Speaker A's enjoyment of Mexican food and drinks leading to Speaker B's situation. These inconsistencies and unclear connections detract from the MEMORY's utility in generating a coherent and relevant next response in the dialogue context provided."
