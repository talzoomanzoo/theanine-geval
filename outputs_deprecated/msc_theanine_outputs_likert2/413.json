Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin!\nSpeaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name? \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is excited for the trip and looking forward to trying the best iced tea.\nSpeaker A has a Subaru and a cat named Ginger, considering naming a new kitten Pumpkin.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that can be useful for Speaker A to generate a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker A has a cat named Ginger and is considering naming a new kitten Pumpkin, which directly ties into the dialogue about naming a kitten. While it doesn't explain the reason behind changing the name from Marmalade to Pumpkin, it confirms that Speaker A is engaged in naming pets, adding a hint as to why \"Pumpkin\" might have been chosen. However, the memory about Speaker B being excited for a trip is unrelated to the context and does not contribute helpful information for the conversation about the kitten's name."
