Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?\nSpeaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping?\nSpeaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp?\nSpeaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer?\nSpeaker A: I've only camped in a tent so far, but would like to try out a camper trailer. What do use for camping?\nSpeaker B: We usually do tents but we have camped in yurts too. Did you go to the zoo last weekend?\nSpeaker A: I see. Yes, I did make it to the zoo.  Have you gone to your local zoo?\nSpeaker B: I went to the Bronx zoo it was amazing! Did you get to see Joshua?\nSpeaker A: I think the Bronx Zoo is one of the best in the country.   Yes, I did see Joshua.  Did you use a season pass for the zoo or just a one time ticket?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities. This has led Speaker B's child to want to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys. In return, Speaker A has a kitten and enjoys visiting the zoo, particularly to see the tiger named Joshua.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "We used a season pass for the zoo. It's definitely worth it for frequent visits!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information, such as Speaker A's interest in visiting the zoo and the specific mention of Joshua the tiger, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where they discuss zoo visits. However, the mention that Speaker A grew up in big cities and the implication about Speaker B's child wanting to visit the zoo seems only tangentially related to the current discussion and does not directly facilitate the development of responses based on the present dialogue. The connection and causality of the memory with the context could be stronger, hence a mid-level score."
