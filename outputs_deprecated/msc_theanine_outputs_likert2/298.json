Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods.\nSpeaker B: Oh that sounds fun! What is it about?\nSpeaker A: Black Widow is one of the character in the Marvel Avengers movies. Like Thor and Captain America. Have you seen any of those movies?\nSpeaker B: No I haven't seen any of those. What foods did you eat while watching the movie?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys spending time with their siblings and going out on their houseboat. Speaker A is looking forward to having dinner with their brother before going dancing. Speaker A's brother is a fan of Brazilian food, especially steak.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information, particularly about Speaker A's brother being a fan of Brazilian food. This detail is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT since Speaker A mentioned having Brazilian foods while watching the Black Widow movie. However, the other pieces of information, such as Speaker B's interest in spending time on their houseboat and Speaker A's dinner and dancing plans, are not directly relevant to the current conversation about movies and food. Additionally, the connections or developments between these topics are not clear, making the MEMORY only somewhat helpful in generating a natural next response."
