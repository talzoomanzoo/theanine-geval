Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: Do you like your job at the computer company? Do you build computers or work on programming?\nSpeaker B: I do like my job. My job is to troubleshoot issues between the hardware and software, so I get to work with both.\nSpeaker A: That sounds interesting. That's great that you love your job, not many people do.\nSpeaker B: Love is a strong word! I do like it though. There have been jobs I hated and I'm great full not be in that place. Hows you job going?\nSpeaker A: Its going good. Its summer so we are really busy right now. I am just grateful to be back at work. How long have you worked for your company?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys Disney World more than their child, and Speaker A enjoys reading books about ice cream, Disney World, and computers, which causes Speaker A to be open to meeting for lunch and flexible with food choices. Speaker A works for a small local business with a demanding schedule, which is hindering their ability to meet for lunch, but they are still open to it. Speaker B wants to change careers but is unable to until their child graduates, while Speaker A is considering quitting their job to work at Disney World for happiness and is also interested in a career in dentistry.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some background information about Speaker A and Speaker B, such as their interests in Disney World and their career considerations. However, the information isn't directly related to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where the discussion primarily revolves around jobs in the tech industry and current work experiences. The memory fails to establish a direct connection or causality to the context about their jobs at computer-related companies. The sentences about Disney World and different career ambitions can be distracting and don't effectively contribute to the development of the current conversation about their current job satisfaction and work conditions. Therefore, while it offers some background knowledge, it doesn't particularly help in generating the next response relevantly to the ongoing topic."
