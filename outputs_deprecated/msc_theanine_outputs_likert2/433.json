Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\nSpeaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it.\nSpeaker A: Cool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot. What is your favorite part about camping?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout. This involvement has led Speaker A to appreciate Speaker B's dedication and invites them to a youth retreat. Speaker B wants to earn the Eagle Scout badge for college applications.\nSpeaker B is busy with scouts, school, work, and tennis, but is willing to take vacation days for the retreat. Additionally, Speaker B is considering attending a local community college for the first couple of years.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "My favorite part about camping is being able to disconnect from the busyness of everyday life and just enjoy nature.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a decent amount of helpful information that connects well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It reveals Speaker B's long involvement with Boy Scouts, which aligns with the conversation about survival skills and camping. This information helps demonstrate why Speaker B can provide insights into the benefits of Boy Scouts. Additionally, it mentions Speaker B's goal of earning the Eagle Scout badge, which could be a motivation topic in the dialogue. However, the memory includes details like college plans which are less directly relevant to the current context. Overall, the memory offers useful context but could be more focused on directly relevant information."
