Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods.\nSpeaker B: Oh that sounds fun! What is it about?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B expressed interest in trying healing methods mentioned by Speaker A, who enjoys salsa dancing and is planning to go out dancing. Speaker B enjoys bartending mainly for the fun aspect and the tips they receive, and works as a bartender, enjoying meeting different people.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

The MEMORY should ideally provide more information about similar previous interactions around movies, fun experiences, meals, or a pattern relevant to movies that might help Speaker A generate a cohesive response.\n\n3. **Evaluating Memory Relevance**: The MEMORY provided talks mainly about other topics unrelated to the movie or food experience that was brought up in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It doesn't mention any of their shared experiences with movies or a direct connection to Speaker B's inquiry which is clearly about the movie.\n\n4. **Scoring Based on Causality/Connection**: Since the MEMORY does not logically connect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, the development or causality seems to be missing, making it less helpful.\n\nBased on this analysis, I'd personally give it a score of around 1 or 2, based on the criteria specified, since MEMORY is not providing the relevant supportive information that Speaker A could use to respond directly to Speaker B's query regarding the movie.\n\nHelpfulness Score: 1"
