Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \nSpeaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with?\nSpeaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point.\nSpeaker A: Yes, it contains eggs.  I think you would do well with the fried rice. It's best to cook the rice the day before.  \nSpeaker B: I didn't know that. Why cook the rice beforehand? Is it better to age rice or something?\nSpeaker A: The rice needs to be cool before adding to the pan.  Are you able to take a passenger along in you truck?\nSpeaker B: Oh! That makes since. I didn't realize that the temperature made a difference when frying rice. As for the truck, Yes I can. But, depending on what company I'm working for at the time, they often set restrictions on passengers.\nSpeaker A: The rice tends to stick together if it's warm.  I would like to ride along with you sometime when you're able.\nSpeaker B: I actually have a scheduled haul for next Wednesday. Do you want to come along for that ride? It should take about five hours.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B lives in a rural area with a farm and can relate to cooking. This allows Speaker B to easily understand the cooking process and ingredients. Speaker A bakes muffins and bread but is conscious of their impact on their weight, showing a consideration for healthy eating habits. Speaker A is interested in running a business with their cooking skills, indicating a potential entrepreneurial spirit. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker, showing a willingness to explore new culinary techniques. \n\nSpeaker A is from the south of India and prefers warm summer weather, influencing their cooking preferences towards Indian cuisine and rice dishes. Speaker A primarily cooks Indian food and bakes a lot of rice dishes, showcasing their culinary expertise in these specific areas. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken, highlighting their diverse cooking skills and preferences.\n\nSpeaker B does not cook, but enjoys listening to country music and drives trucks for a living. This contrasts with Speaker B's husband, who is a skilled cook specializing in Asian cuisine with extensive prep work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe memory provides some helpful information, but it is somewhat scattered and does not entirely focus on the context of the dialogue interaction. The information that Speaker B lives in a rural area, relates to cooking, and is interested in learning with a pressure cooker is relevant to the conversation. The mention of Speaker A's cooking expertise in Indian and rice dishes is relevant as it aligns with the shrimp fried rice recommendation. However, details about Speaker A's entrepreneurial spirit, muffin and bread baking, and considerations for healthy eating are unnecessary for the current dialogue. Background about Speaker B's husband being a skilled cook specializing in Asian cuisine could have been helpful if connected to the dialogue about trying Asian recipes, but this link is not explicitly made in the memory. Overall, the memory lacks concise focus on the direct causal and relevant elements of their past interactions to maximize its helpfulness."
