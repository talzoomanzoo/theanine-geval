Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys the country lifestyle and winter season, while Speaker B prefers grilling steaks with an old charcoal grill. Speaker A is excited about spending quiet evenings outdoors during the summer and potentially grilling most nights.\n\nSpeaker B is currently renovating their house to meet their standards for living with pets, and both Speaker A and Speaker B admit to their lack of expertise in interior decorating. They plan to meet up to discuss a furniture exchange, where Speaker A invites Speaker B over for a night of music, food, and company to enjoy the new furniture.\n\nBoth Speaker A and Speaker B share a love for barbecuing and pets. Speaker A suggests seasoning everything and using a smoker for grilling, while Speaker B recommends making extra barbecue for leftovers on nights when grilling is not feasible due to time or energy constraints.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds fantastic! I can't wait to hear you play. Let's set a date for our barbecue soon.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information that can aid in generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memory mentions BBQ and spending time outdoors, hobbies shared by both speakers, as well as Speaker A's enjoyment of preparing food for extended periods, such as using a smoker. This connects with Speaker A's suggestion about playing guitar at the barbecue, indicating that they enjoy creating enjoyable atmospheres during gatherings. However, the connection between guitar playing and the provided memories could be more explicit, bringing the memory's score to a 4, as not all sentences may directly inform the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
