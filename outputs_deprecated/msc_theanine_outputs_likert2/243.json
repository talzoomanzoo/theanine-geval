Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not!\nSpeaker B: Have you been hiking lately?\nSpeaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me.\nSpeaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks. This has led to Speaker A planning several camping trips for the summer and deciding to do a part of the Appalachian Trail. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking as free activities, and this aligns with their interest in looking for wild animals in the woods.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful context about Speaker A's overall interest in camping and hiking, which is relevant to the dialogue context regarding a recent hike Speaker A led with friends. The memory also indicates Speaker A's plans for future camping trips, hinting at their enthusiasm for these activities, which could be useful for generating responses in line with this passion. While the MEMORY is mostly relevant, it could be more helpful if it included information about past experiences with friends during such activities or challenges faced, creating a deeper connection with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Nonetheless, the provided MEMORY contains relevant details and is structured in a way that logically connects Speaker A's interests and past actions."
