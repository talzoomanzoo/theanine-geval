Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself!\nSpeaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food?\nSpeaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too?\nSpeaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also?\nSpeaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways?\nSpeaker B: They've been better as I left my previous job so I'm spending more time with them, how do you manage to work full time and still keep those animals happy?\nSpeaker A: I think working at the zoo so long has helped. Why did you leave your last job. Was that the one you were working in the warehouse? Sorry to hear about your dogs, it can be hard managing older animals.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has two terrier dogs as pets. Speaker A works at a zoo and has tried playing music for the white tigers and home concerts for their pets. Speaker B is looking for a new job and is excited about the opportunity at the zoo. Speaker B has elderly terriers and is planning to leave their part-time job for a break before starting a new one.\nSpeaker A has penguins at the zoo and enjoys working with animals, offering Speaker B a chance to help out. Speaker A mentions having dogs and Speaker B admires them for their peaceful nature. Speaker B asks Speaker A if they have had a pet raccoon before.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, leaving my part-time job has been a nice change. It's good to have this time with my dogs before starting something new.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information that are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker B has two terrier dogs and is looking for a new job, which aligns with the context where Speaker B talks about leaving their job and spending more time with their dogs. Additionally, the memory notes that Speaker A works at a zoo, which relates to Speaker A's mention of working at the zoo for a long time. The MEMORY provides context for Speaker B's excitement about a zoo opportunity, which could be explored in the conversation. However, some parts of the MEMORY, such as Speaker A playing music for white tigers or home concerts for pets, and Speaker B asking about a pet raccoon, are not directly connected to the current flow of the conversation, slightly reducing its overall helpfulness. Overall, the memory is helpful, with some naturally connected points, but not entirely aligned with all aspects of the dialogue."
