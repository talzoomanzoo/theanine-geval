Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself!\nSpeaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food?\nSpeaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A loves animals, especially white tigers. Speaker A mentions having dogs and Speaker B admires them for their peaceful nature. Speaker B asks Speaker A if they have had a pet raccoon before.\nSpeaker A's pet raccoon enjoys eating pizza, which causes Speaker A's friend to find two baby raccoons in her yard, one of which was given to Speaker A to keep as a pet.\nSpeaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid, which causes Speaker B to ask Speaker A if they have had a pet raccoon before.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some background information about Speaker A's pets, including Journey the raccoon and Sid the bearded dragon. However, there are discrepancies and confusing details that affect its helpfulness. For instance, initially it states that Speaker A loves animals, especially white tigers, which is irrelevant to the current dialogue context. Furthermore, the confusion arises from mentioning Speaker A has a pet raccoon, Journey, who enjoys eating pizza, yet there is no clear causality or connection drawn to the current issue of Journey opening the fridge. Additionally, the mention of Speaker B admiring Speaker A's dogs for their peaceful nature is not relevant to the discussion about Journey. Overall, the MEMORY lacks a coherent structure connecting the information to the current conversation, which affects its usefulness."
