Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is studying marketing and enjoys it, while Speaker B practices Karate and holds a green belt, being involved in other activities and considering going back to school for a certificate in IT work. Both Speaker A and Speaker B have interests in learning new languages. Speaker B is considering a career change to the IT sector due to their computer skills and the growing demand for employees in that sector. Speaker B currently works as a lifeguard, which is physically demanding and not suitable for a long-term career.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I've also dabbled in Taekwondo and Judo before focusing on Karate.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant background information about Speaker B's interest in martial arts, specifically Karate, which is directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A inquires about martial arts. It helps provide context for Speaker B's potential response about martial arts experience. However, the information about Speaker B's career considerations, IT sector interest, lifeguard job, and Speaker A's marketing studies and interest in languages are not directly relevant to the immediate context of martial arts discussion. While these additional details offer a broader understanding of Speaker B, they do not contribute to the specific conversation about studying martial arts. The MEMORY could be more focused or cohesive regarding martial arts to warrant a higher score."
