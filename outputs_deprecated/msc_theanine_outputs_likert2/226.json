Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself!\nSpeaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food?\nSpeaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too?\nSpeaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also?\nSpeaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways?\nSpeaker B: They've been better as I left my previous job so I'm spending more time with them, how do you manage to work full time and still keep those animals happy?\nSpeaker A: I think working at the zoo so long has helped. Why did you leave your last job. Was that the one you were working in the warehouse? Sorry to hear about your dogs, it can be hard managing older animals.\nSpeaker B: Yea, that totally makes sense! I just wanted time off to spend with the dogs and look for a better job elsewhere, I'm hoping that I'll be able to get a job outside of a warehouse!\nSpeaker A: That is understandable. I didn't always think I would end up a zookeeper. Do you have anything in mind?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has elderly terriers as pets and is planning to leave their part-time job for a break before starting a new one. \nSpeaker A works at a zoo as a zookeeper and loves animals, especially white tigers, and is willing to help Speaker B get an entry-level position there. \nSpeaker A does not play music for the animals at the zoo to keep them calm, but has penguins at the zoo and enjoys working with animals, offering Speaker B a chance to help out.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures key facts about both speakers: that Speaker B has elderly terriers and is looking to take a break from their part-time job, and that Speaker A works as a zookeeper and likes animals. However, the MEMORY includes information that wasn't discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker A's love for white tigers, their offer to help Speaker B get a position, and details about playing music for the animals. These pieces of information, while potentially useful, do not directly correlate with the current context and are not naturally connected to the dialogue. Therefore, they might not significantly aid in generating Speaker B's next response based on the existing conversation."
