    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have plan to make garden in my home. I want some suggestion from you.\nSpeaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them\nSpeaker A: IN MY HOME?! A TREE? That was not at all what I was thinking. Do they grow well indoors? I am intrigued. \nSpeaker B: Well if you want to make it like a proper garden experience then I would suggest going all in, and go for the best most authentic looking items you could get \nSpeaker A: Wow! Ok! This is sounding like a bigger undertaking! Should I embrace bugs in the home if they help the plants or am I getting wild?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden. Speaker B mentions weight gain from spending time at the computer and plans to work in the garden more. Speaker A struggles with gardening but finds the idea of space plants intriguing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Embracing bugs in your home can be beneficial for your plants, but it's ultimately up to your comfort level. There are ways to manage pests naturally if needed.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful context about Speaker B's knowledge of plants and gardening, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where they are giving suggestions about making a garden. It also gives insight into Speaker A's struggles with gardening and interest in space plants, which could be relevant for crafting further responses. However, the MEMORY lacks specific details about their past interactions that would be directly helpful for generating the next response, such as specific advice or experiences shared between them that relate directly to Speaker A's questions about having trees indoors or managing bugs. Additionally, the section about Speaker B's weight gain and plans to work in the garden more doesn't directly connect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which makes the MEMORY less cohesive in terms of causality and relevancy."
