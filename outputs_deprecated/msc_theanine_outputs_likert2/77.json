Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A, a librarian who loves kids, mentions having 3 children and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. They want to interact more with their children.\n\nSpeaker B's kids do not go to work by boat like Speaker A. This leads Speaker B to think about making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature. Speaker B enjoys spending time with their grandkids at the park, who are more interested in phones and tablets than musical instruments.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I do use text messaging to stay in touch with my grandkids. It's a convenient way to communicate with them, especially since they are so tech-savvy.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but is not presented in a highly connected or causal way. It provides some background on Speaker A and Speaker B's interests and family life, which is useful for generating a response to the question about technology and interaction with grandchildren. However, it lacks a clear connection or causality between the details provided. Understanding that Speaker B enjoys spending time with grandkids at the park and their interest in phones and tablets can inform a response about using technology for interaction, but more explicit connections or causality between past interactions or events could improve the MEMORY's helpfulness."
