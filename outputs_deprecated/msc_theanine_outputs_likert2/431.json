Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Speaker A feels lonely due to their husband's frequent traveling, suggesting that Speaker B join one of the church retreats in the future. Speaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat, wanting more children. Speaker B, not yet in college, hopes to become an Eagle Scout, which caused them to be a member of the Boy Scouts and work at a fast food place. Speaker A appreciates Speaker B's dedication to the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I've definitely learned a lot of survival skills through Boy Scouts. It's been a really rewarding experience.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information about Speaker B's involvement with the Boy Scouts, such as their role in the scout troop and their aspiration to become an Eagle Scout. This context relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A is discussing Boy Scouts and survival skills, which can be useful for generating a response. However, the MEMORY also contains information unrelated to the current conversation, such as Speaker A's loneliness and invitations to church retreats, which may not directly aid in generating the next immediate response. Additionally, the MEMORY repeats the same information and lacks clarity in the connection between various statements. Overall, the MEMORY is moderately helpful in relation to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
