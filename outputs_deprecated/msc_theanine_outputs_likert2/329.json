Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I won a 3rd Place prize in an origami contest!! It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume.\nSpeaker B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment. \nSpeaker A: Yea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think?\nSpeaker A: It depends on what you are trying to make out of origami, you can make some super complicated stuff, there's actually special paper that you can get for it! You may have seen origami be used in the hospital for some breathing aperatus!\nSpeaker B: That's amazing. I had no idea, but that totally makes sense. Do you have to practice a lot -- sort of a use it or lose it kind of thing?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys art and music, specifically painting. Speaker A is working on painting projects in their craft room. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next. Speaker A learned origami by themselves in their craft room.\n\nSpeaker B enjoys running and singing. Speaker B enjoys traveling and visiting gardens. Speaker A is interested in trying to make a lotus origami next. Speaker A enjoys origami and tried making a Lotus flower successfully.\n\nSpeaker A enjoys art and music, specifically painting. Speaker B enjoys traveling and visiting gardens. Speaker B was recommended volunteering by Speaker A and has traveled to Japan and Italy, enjoying the art and food. Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami in a few weeks.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, practice definitely helps improve your skills in origami. It's all about getting the folds just right!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information to generate a proper response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes details about Speaker A's interest in origami, which aligns with the current conversation about Speaker A's origami contest accomplishment and Speaker B's desire to learn origami. The memory also mentions that Speaker A has successfully made a lotus flower origami, which might be a topic to further explore in the conversation.\n\nAdditionally, the memory indicates that Speaker A offered to teach Speaker B origami, which directly relates to Speaker B expressing interest in learning origami from Speaker A in the dialogue. However, there is some repetition and unnecessary information about other hobbies of Speaker A and B, like painting and traveling, which are less relevant to the current context. Despite this, the relevant parts are well-connected and support the conversation in context."
