Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you talked to your advisor about your career options? Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\nSpeaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach?\nSpeaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B wants to turn their linguistics major into a practical job, while Speaker A wants to develop apps for differently abled youth through studying computer science. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics. \nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science, while Speaker B is considering further education to become a college professor in linguistics, feeling limited in job opportunities.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that can assist in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains helpful insights about both speakers' aspirations and current situations: Speaker B's intention to turn their linguistics major into a practical job aligns with their interest in teaching English or history, which was mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Similarly, Speaker A's aspirations to develop apps through their computer science studies align with their expression of interest in teaching robotics. Furthermore, the MEMORY adds additional context about Speaker A's work experience and Speaker B's consideration of further education, which could be naturally included in future conversation topics. However, while relevant, the MEMORY could be more coherently structured to enhance readability and clarity of the causality or development of these ideas."
