Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive.\nSpeaker B: Oh I see. Are you happy with it other than the price?\nSpeaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B expresses interest in potentially moving out of the city and enjoying a more peaceful life on the farm. Speaker A enjoys the peace and quiet of country life, the fresh produce, and fresh air.\nSpeaker A mentions that Speaker B's kids could try milking cows on the farm, which Speaker B finds amusing. Speaker A works on a family farm and will be using the new truck for farm work.\nSpeaker B believes that luxurious items distract from the value of their family. Speaker A bought 50 lotto tickets with different numbers to increase their chances of winning.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear. Music is always a good way to relax and unwind.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some unrelated or loosely connected points to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While there is a mention of luxurious items, which may slightly connect to the conversation about the expensive iPhone, the other details about Speaker B potentially wanting to move to a farm or Speaker A's various activities such as working on a family farm and buying lotto tickets, do not provide clear contextual relevance or causality for generating a specific response in the context of the current dialogue about the iPhone. The MEMORY lacks a coherent connection or relevant expansion on the topic at hand, making it less helpful in guiding a natural continuation of the current conversation."
