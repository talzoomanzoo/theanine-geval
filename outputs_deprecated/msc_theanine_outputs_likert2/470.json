Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens, thank you so much for your advice. Can you tell me about it?\nSpeaker B: Yes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see. \nSpeaker A: I definitely will, this sounds like such an amazing trip. How long has it been since you've been there yourself?\nSpeaker B: I was in Greece last two years ago.   I am excited to go again soon!    At somepoint I would like to take a cruise around the islands there.  It seems like a neat way to see all the Islands in an easy way.   Have you ever taken a cruise?\nSpeaker A: Only once before when I was very young, so I don't remember much. It sounds like such a relaxing way to enjoy the day, though. Maybe we can plan a cruise together sometime.\nSpeaker B: That would be fun!  I go to Europe a lot so maybe a cruise in the Caribbean would be nice.  I would like to see Saint Lucia and Saint Thomas. \nSpeaker A: Oh, Europe? I'm already sold on the idea, sounds like a blast! I've never had a negative experience in Europe. Should we visit some of the capital cities?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five because Speaker B has three kids. \nSpeaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian. Speaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five. Speaker B asks Speaker A if their trip is more for relaxation or sightseeing. \nSpeaker A has traveled around Europe before, visiting capital cities of each country because Speaker A has kids and is familiar with Greek mythology. Speaker A booked a plane ticket to Rome on a whim and is leaving in two weeks.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely! Visiting the capital cities in Europe is such a great way to experience the history and culture of each country. I'm sure we'll have an amazing time exploring!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information regarding Speaker B's interest in visiting Greece and their family context, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker B expresses excitement about visiting Greece and interest in planning trips. However, the MEMORY contains redundant points about planning a trip to Greece and does not naturally connect to the current topic of cruises or European capital cities, which is the primary focus of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The information regarding Speaker B being excited about visiting Greece for the first time also contradicts the dialogue where they state they were in Greece two years ago. Additionally, Speaker A's travel experiences mentioned in MEMORY do not clearly relate to the ongoing conversation topics. Overall, while there is some relevant context, the MEMORY lacks clarity, cohesion, and a natural progression that would properly assist in generating the next response."
