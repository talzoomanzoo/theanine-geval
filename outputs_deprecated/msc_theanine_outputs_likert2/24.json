Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Are you planning on continuing to work in the lab when they clone the cow? That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is a high school student planning to go to college, achieving straight A's. Speaker A wants Speaker B to continue working in the lab and school instead of giving up their night job. Speaker B is also a high school student preparing for college, working at a diner at night. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I agree, it's hard to know for sure where our food comes from. I'll keep working hard in the lab and school.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information, such as Speaker B's involvement in both school and work, which aligns with Speaker B's concern about having to quit working in the lab if classes get too hard. The mention of Speaker A encouraging Speaker B to continue working in the lab and managing school is relevant to the conversation. However, the details about Speaker B having hamburgers for dinner are unrelated to the context and do not help in generating a response. The MEMORY offers some context, but the connection and relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT could be stronger."
