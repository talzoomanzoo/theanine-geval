Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her?\nSpeaker B: Hi there, hope you are wlll and managing to save up for your Italy trip?  Thank for asking about the Greek mythology study, we are doing very well. It helps because i am so passionate about it and hope to get to the Greek islands soon\nSpeaker A: Yes I have been saving up for another trip to Italy! I can't wait. It's planned for next Spring. Do you have any plans to go back to Italy in the future?\nSpeaker B: I would love to get back to Italy but need to save up and the hopeful priority is to Greece this year.  You have friends in Europe are you in contact to see what plans you can make?\nSpeaker A: Yes I've been talking to them quite a bit so they know what's going on. I'll be staying with some of them while I'm over there. I have never been to Greece....I'd like to go though. Maybe I'll add it to my itinerary! Maybe we could plan to be in Greece at the same time?!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is excited for their upcoming trip to Italy next Spring and has been saving up for it. They have friends in Europe who they have been in contact with to make plans. Speaker B, on the other hand, is interested in visiting Greece this year due to their passion for Greek mythology.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That would be amazing if we could coordinate our trips to Greece and Italy! It would be fun to explore together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model to generate a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It accurately captures the main points discussed: Speaker A's plans for a trip to Italy and communication with friends in Europe, as well as Speaker B's interest in visiting Greece, which aligns with their passion for Greek mythology. The MEMORY is relevant and connected to the conversation, offering key context for further dialogue about travel plans and interests in Greek mythology. However, it could be more helpful by including more context about their conversation, such as their mutual interest in possibly planning to be in Greece at the same time."
