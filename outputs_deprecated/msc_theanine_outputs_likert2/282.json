Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her?\nSpeaker B: Hi there, hope you are wlll and managing to save up for your Italy trip?  Thank for asking about the Greek mythology study, we are doing very well. It helps because i am so passionate about it and hope to get to the Greek islands soon\nSpeaker A: Yes I have been saving up for another trip to Italy! I can't wait. It's planned for next Spring. Do you have any plans to go back to Italy in the future?\nSpeaker B: I would love to get back to Italy but need to save up and the hopeful priority is to Greece this year.  You have friends in Europe are you in contact to see what plans you can make?\nSpeaker A: Yes I've been talking to them quite a bit so they know what's going on. I'll be staying with some of them while I'm over there. I have never been to Greece....I'd like to go though. Maybe I'll add it to my itinerary! Maybe we could plan to be in Greece at the same time?!\nSpeaker B: That would be so good.  There is so much history and the roman statues i take my daughter to see in the museums and through our local resources is fab.  She is building up the passion which is lovely to see.  Have you still got your hair blue or has it grown out now?\nSpeaker A: That's awesome! Maybe you can teach me a little about all the mythology. I think I've never liked it before only because I didn't understand it. My hair is back to being its natural brown - lol I'm being boring for the moment.\nSpeaker B: Never boring you will keep styling it all sorts of interesting styles im sure.  Yes i would be lovely to be your guide for the day out in Greece.  Bring some decent walking boots and some sun cream, its a different heat out there but your tan is probably topped up with going to the beach each day.\nSpeaker A: That's good advice! Thank you! I saw on the news Cali has been getting a lot of rain. Have you still been able to run on the beach each day?\nSpeaker B: I've got very wet most days unfortunately but need to keep up with the exercise.  Been taking to the gym to keep dry.  When im not out in the surf of a morning first thing on the weekends, to avoid the crowds as you know im not too good at the surfing but its good fun. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is planning for a spring break trip and recently bought a dress for Easter. Speaker B does not have any trips planned but expresses interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology. Speaker A is fascinated by the architecture of Italy and enjoys studying history, especially through reading and watching documentaries.\n\nSpeaker A is planning for a spring break trip and recently bought a dress for Easter.

    "raw_prediction": "Running on the beach sounds like a great workout! I'm sure the gym is a good alternative on rainy days. Surfing must be quite the experience, even if you're not a pro at it.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information regarding Speaker A's and Speaker B's travel plans and interests. For instance, it mentions Speaker A's upcoming trip to Italy and Speaker B's interest in visiting Greece, both of which are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY includes some repetitive entries, and there is little direct link or causality demonstrated between sentences. While it captures some relevant topics such as travel and Greek mythology, it lacks depth and continuity in its narrative connections, reducing its helpfulness. Additionally, there is new information in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, like Speaker A's blue hair, which is not reflected in the MEMORY, possibly limiting its completeness and relevance."
