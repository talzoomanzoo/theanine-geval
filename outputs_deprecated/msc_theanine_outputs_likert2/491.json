Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for.\nSpeaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for?\nSpeaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\nSpeaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise? \nSpeaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A, a recent high school graduate on a cross-country journey, is eager to visit the Columbia Trail and Ken Lockwood Gorge for a camping and hiking trip. Additionally, Speaker A applied for a job at a grocery store near a hiking trail. Speaker A also plans to leave a hammock by the river for fellow hikers to use at a hidden spot off the main hiking trail and suggests bringing water for the hike, mentioning a picnic at the mountain top.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great idea! Being a park guide could be really fulfilling. You should definitely look into that more.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information, such as Speaker A's interest in hiking and the application for a job at a grocery store, which matches the context of the grocery store job offer in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the details about the cross-country journey, camping trip, and plans to leave a hammock seem disconnected from the immediate dialogue about jobs and career aspirations. This additional information is not causally or contextually linked to the conversation, making the MEMORY less helpful overall. The MEMORY lacks a natural flow and linkage between past interactions and the current dialogue topic."
