Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read.\nSpeaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting? \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A feels exhausted after looking after their lively grandchildren, who are now capable of keeping themselves entertained with technology or TV. Speaker A also suggests taking naps during quiet moments and mentions spending time with her grandchildren.\n2. Speaker A feels worn out after spending time with their energetic grandchildren, who have watched Toy Story multiple times.\n3. Speaker A, who has 8 grandchildren and likes reading books and watching Netflix, now has grandchildren who are old enough to entertain themselves with technology or TV. Speaker A also enjoys watching movies with her grandchildren and mentions watching them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, it was a thrilling mystery novel. It's nice to have some quiet time to myself for a change.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information regarding Speaker A's experiences with their grandchildren, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Speaker A mentions not watching the grandkids and checking out a book to read. Sentences in MEMORY highlight Speaker A's previous experiences and feelings after spending time with their grandchildren, which can be helpful in understanding their current state or preference for reading over babysitting. However, the memories are somewhat repetitive and could benefit from better connection and causality to fully integrate past interactions and current choices. There is some contextual information, but it lacks a clear development or relevance that immediately connects to the conversational flow in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
