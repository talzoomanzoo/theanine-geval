Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: the grocery store contacted me to offer me the job I had applied for.\nSpeaker B: Oh, that's good news; what position did you apply for?\nSpeaker A: A shift lead position. Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\nSpeaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise? \nSpeaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows.\nSpeaker A: That sounds wonderful! You'd get to just be out in nature all day. Sounds like a great job, especially if you're a bit introverted like me. That's why hiking is my favorite -- a good solitary activity. \nSpeaker B: Yes, I agree. What kind of hours would this new job have?\nSpeaker A: It's third shift, which isn't the greatest, but it pays a bit more than the other shifts, and I think I'll like getting off early in the morning. Then I can just go down and get in my hammock and have a nice relaxing moment after work. \n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is looking for a job and new camping gear, specifically a hammock, and plans to leave a hammock by the river for anyone to use at a hidden spot off the main hiking trail. There is a lake at the hiking trail, and Speaker A suggests swimming in it, warning that the water may be cold. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking, mentioning setting up a hammock at their campsite, and has gone hiking with Speaker B before and plans to meet up for another hike. Speaker B is not in the best hiking shape and jokes about needing to recharge their energy.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a nice way to unwind after a shift. A hammock by the river does sound tempting, especially after a long night at work.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information for Speaker B to generate a response that connects with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes details about Speaker A's interest in camping and hiking, which aligns with their comment about enjoying hiking in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, it introduces details, such as leaving a hammock by the river and specifics about the hiking trail and lake, that do not directly relate to the job conversation or Speaker B's current job situation and interests. While it does provide background on past interactions, such as their hiking experiences together, it could be more focused and concise in covering what happened in their previous dialogues. Overall, it is somewhat helpful but scattered with less pertinent details."
