Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?\nSpeaker B: Yes she loved it!  It was a great weekend. Have you done much camping?\nSpeaker A: I have done a little camping and would like to do more in the future. What is one of your favorite places to camp?\nSpeaker B: I like Manitoba. Do you camp in a tent or Yurt, cabin or camper trailer?\nSpeaker A: I've only camped in a tent so far, but would like to try out a camper trailer. What do use for camping?\nSpeaker B: We usually do tents but we have camped in yurts too. Did you go to the zoo last weekend?\nSpeaker A: I see. Yes, I did make it to the zoo.  Have you gone to your local zoo?\nSpeaker B: I went to the Bronx zoo it was amazing! Did you get to see Joshua?\nSpeaker A: I think the Bronx Zoo is one of the best in the country.   Yes, I did see Joshua.  Did you use a season pass for the zoo or just a one time ticket?\nSpeaker B: One time. I was just there visititng family. What is your favorite zoo to visit?\nSpeaker A: I think the Ashville Zoo is nice. What are your plans for the next weekend?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A frequently visits the zoo and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys. Speaker B's daughter also likes monkeys and is asserting her independence. Speaker A, who grew up in big cities, has a kitten and loves visiting the zoo to see the tiger named Joshua. Speaker B's child wants to visit the zoo to see the monkeys, which was caused by Speaker A suggesting taking pets to the zoo. Speaker B, a parent, is advocating for their daughter's school to have a field trip to the zoo.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could help Speaker B generate a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY mentions Speaker A's interest in zoos, specifically enjoying seeing tigers and monkeys, and has seen the tiger named Joshua. This directly relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Joshua, presumably a tiger at a zoo, is mentioned. It also mentions Speaker B's daughter liking monkeys and Speaker B advocating for a school trip to the zoo, which could relate to planning future activities, possibly linked to the upcoming weekend plans mentioned in the dialogue. \n\nHowever, the MEMORY includes information that doesn't seem to directly contribute to a natural progression or causality between past interactions â€“ for example, the assertion of independence by Speaker B's daughter and the notion of taking pets to the zoo initiated by Speaker A, which seem disconnected from what's currently being discussed. Additionally, the potential causality in some statements is not clear or coherent, which affects the helpfulness in guiding the conversation naturally forward based on the context provided."
