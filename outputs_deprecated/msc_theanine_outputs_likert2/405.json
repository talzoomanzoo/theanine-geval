Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read.\nSpeaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting? \nSpeaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far.\nSpeaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes. \nSpeaker A: why don't you like books like that?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A feels exhausted after looking after their energetic grandchildren. This leads Speaker A to suggest taking naps during quiet times and mentions the idea of watching her grandkids. Speaker B, who is a parent to a young son keeping them busy, considers volunteering at an animal shelter once her son begins school. Additionally, Speaker A, with 8 grandchildren, enjoys reading books and watching Netflix, while Speaker B's wife expresses a liking for Ken Jennings as a potential host for Jeopardy.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "I prefer books that are a bit more light-hearted and uplifting, like a good comedy or a heartwarming story.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several disjointed pieces of information about Speaker A and Speaker B that do not clearly connect or provide relevant details for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While it mentions Speaker Aâ€™s exhaustion caring for grandchildren and their interest in reading, it does not specifically address the current discussion about book preferences, nor does it explain their enthusiasm for crime dramas. The mention of Speaker B's personal life with a young son and their wife's preference for a Jeopardy host is unrelated to the topic at hand. Overall, the MEMORY lacks coherence and relevance, limiting its helpfulness in generating a suitable response for the ongoing dialogue."
