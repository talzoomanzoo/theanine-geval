Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I've heard that Boy Scouts teaches a lot of survival skills like setting up shelter and figuring out how to get a fire started no matter what materials you have on hand. Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\nSpeaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it.\nSpeaker A: Cool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot. What is your favorite part about camping?\nSpeaker B: I love being out in the wilderness and sleeping under the stars in the fresh air. It makes you realize how beautiful life is and how small we really are in comparison to the universe.\nSpeaker A: I miss doing that! I have done lots of picnics with my family but it's been a long time since I've slept in a tent! Looking forward to it again when the kids are older. Where was the last place you went?\nSpeaker B: We went up to an island in the middle of nowhere in Canada. There were lots of bears and huge moose!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A wants more children and feels lonely due to their husband's frequent traveling. Speaker A suggested that Speaker B join one of the church retreats in the future. Speaker B appreciates Speaker A's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat. Speaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout.\n\nSpeaker B is not yet in college but hopes to become an Eagle Scout. Speaker A is involved in church activities and mentioned a church retreat. Speaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat. Speaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout.\n\nSpeaker B is not yet in college but hopes to become an Eagle Scout. Speaker B has not taken any vacations recently but has vacation days saved up. Speaker B is busy with scouts, school, work, and tennis, but willing to take vacation days for the retreat. Speaker B is considering attending a local community college for the first couple of years.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Wow, that sounds like quite the adventure! I'm sure your scouting experiences will make for great stories to share with the kids.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful information related to Speaker B's involvement with the Boy Scouts, which is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT discussing camping and survival skills. However, many details in MEMORY, such as Speaker A's feelings about loneliness, church retreats, and Speaker B's personal plans, do not directly aid in generating a next response for the conversation about camping and Boy Scout experiences. Additionally, some information is repeated and unstructured, lacking a clear connection or causality to the current context of the dialogue. Therefore, the MEMORY is only partially helpful."
