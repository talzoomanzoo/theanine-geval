Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket while majoring in Humanities in college. Now, Speaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week. Additionally, Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments. On top of that, Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer recently.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information that could help Speaker B in generating a response to Speaker A's question about their past soccer position. It mentions that Speaker A currently plays as a striker and has been scoring well recently, which might suggest Speaker A has always played in forward positions. However, it lacks direct information or relevance to Speaker A's position during college since it only talks about the present. The rest of the MEMORY focuses more on Speaker A's college life and current soccer activities, which might not directly answer the question posed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The connections between the sentences are somewhat natural, but they don't strongly demonstrate causality or development pertinent to the college soccer experience."
