Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How was your trip? Did your daughter like that place?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities, suggesting taking the pets to the zoo and mentioning that most major cities have good zoos, particularly to see the tiger named Joshua. \nSpeaker B used to have pets but they are now with their wife, and has a young daughter who is 8 years old and becoming independent, considering calling in sick to work to go to the zoo with their child, who wants to visit the zoo, particularly to see the monkeys. Speaker B is a parent, pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It clearly indicates Speaker B's interest in visiting the zoo, their desire to spend time with their daughter, and their daughter's interest in seeing monkeys at the zoo. This MEMORY is closely related to the current topic of discussion about the trip and whether the daughter liked the place, as it provides context about why they went to the zoo and what they intended to see. Additionally, the MEMORY mentions Speaker B's perspectives and actions, like considering calling in sick to work and advocating for a school field trip, which could be useful in crafting a detailed response. The sentences are connected in a way that demonstrates the relevancy and causality of events, enhancing the understanding of their past interactions and motivations."
