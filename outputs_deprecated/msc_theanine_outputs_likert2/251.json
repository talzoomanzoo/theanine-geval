Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys painting and taking naps, but is not entirely satisfied with their current job and wishes it was more rewarding. They have a government job that pays the bills but dreams of working in interior design. Speaker B also feels conflicted about their government job, likening it to having tenure as a college professor.\n\nSpeaker A recently moved to a new city and has two older brothers. The change in location has made job searching challenging for Speaker A, who hopes to settle in the new city soon with a steady income. They are currently preparing for an upcoming interview and feeling nervous about it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that can help a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a thoughtful and informed response. Knowing that Speaker B enjoys painting and dreams of working in interior design directly relates to Speaker A's inquiry about creative and fulfilling work. This establishes a clear connection between Speaker B's interests and the question posed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, Speaker B's conflict about their current government job adds depth to their potential response and provides a realistic perspective on their situation. The details about Speaker A's recent move and job search add context for understanding their current state of mind and creating a more empathetic and engaging dialogue. Overall, this MEMORY is useful and well-structured, providing causality and relevancy to the conversation."
