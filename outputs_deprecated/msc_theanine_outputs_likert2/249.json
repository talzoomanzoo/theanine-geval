Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not!\nSpeaker B: Have you been hiking lately?\nSpeaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me.\nSpeaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway?\nSpeaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day! I'll make it as fun as possible.\nSpeaker B: I will someday. just not in the summer when all the bugs are out! Where do you go hiking the most?\nSpeaker A: I like to go hiking in the local trails here. I am familiar with them and there's so many routes that I can take. Sadly, the bugs are as bad here as they are anywhere else.....\nSpeaker B: They can't be that bad in the fall right? I hope? Do you camp most every weekend?\nSpeaker A: A least a couple of times a month. Sometimes, yeah, I go every weekend to relax. Being in nature is so relaxing to me. And nah the bugs aren't too bad in the fall and winter. There's a beautiful river along one trail that I bet you'd love to see. \nSpeaker B: That sounds like it would be relaxing. I would probable be okay if we didn't run into any wolves, bears etc. Have you ever came across any predators when you were camping?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys camping and hiking as free activities. Speaker B enjoys taking cruises and is not as into the outdoors as Speaker A. Speaker A enjoys camping trips and looking for wild animals in the woods. Speaker A enjoys hiking, birdwatching, and spotting rare animals. Speaker A has never been on a cruise and may consider trying one in the future. Speaker A and Speaker B both enjoy being outdoors, but Speaker B prefers the fresh air over being in the mud and rain. Speaker B shared tips on repelling mosquitos using sprays with 20% DEET and other active ingredients. Speaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks. Speaker A is a personal trainer who loves camping in remote areas. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it. Speaker A is nervous about the Appalachian Trail hike, as they don't usually do full day hikes.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I've been lucky so far and haven't run into any predators while camping. It's always good to be aware of your surroundings though, just in case.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it lacks clear connection and development of the past interactions between Speaker A and Speaker B. It mentions Speaker A's and Speaker B's preferences, such as Speaker A's enjoyment of camping and hiking and Speaker B's preference for cruises, and provides information about Speaker A being a personal trainer. However, some details like Speaker A's nervousness about the Appalachian Trail hike and Speaker B recently enjoying a long hike do not seem directly relevant to the current context. Moreover, the sentences in the MEMORY are somewhat disjointed and do not clearly demonstrate causality or relevancy to the dialogue's flow, which limits its helpfulness in generating a proper next response."
