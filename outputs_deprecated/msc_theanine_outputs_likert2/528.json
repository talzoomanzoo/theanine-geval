Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer?\nSpeaker B: I went to a concert on the fourth of July. It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to?\nSpeaker A: The museum has all sorts of galleries.  It has a sculpture garden outside.  I mostly like the impressionist paintings.  I like Van Gogh.  Was your concert outdoors?\nSpeaker B: Yes. That way they could have a fireworks show too. I love fireworks. Have you ever seen the fireworks at the Disney castle?\nSpeaker A: No, but I have been to Disney World in Florida.  I love fireworks too.  I want to get married on the 4th of July.  That was we will have a national holiday and fireworks for us every year!  It sounds like you've been to Disneyland?\nSpeaker B: No, but I thought you might have since you lived in LA for awhile. Did you get to see any live Disney music performances while you were at Disney World?\nSpeaker A: No, we rode a lot of rides that broke down.  We had to be rescued from the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.  It was stuck.  Someone put on waders and pushed us to the side to climb out.\nSpeaker B: Oh no! Hopefully your trip to the art museum is much better than that. Did your boyfriend go to Disney World too?\nSpeaker A: No, I had a cousin that I went with.  We stayed in a hotel in Miami too and I got so sunburned on the beach!  I'm sure the art museum will be good if it isn't too crowded.  Was your concert crowded?\nSpeaker B: It was so crowded, but my older brothers went with me and kept me from getting squished. Make sure you wear sunscreen when you visit the beach this time!\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys going to museums and trying different foods. They plan to do lots of shopping during their trip.\nSpeaker B is waiting for bands to announce their summer tour schedule to plan which shows to attend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks for the reminder! I'll definitely remember the sunscreen this time. I hope the concert was worth the crowd.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some insight into Speaker A and Speaker B's interests, which could be somewhat useful in generating a follow-up response. Speaker A's interest in museums is relevant to the conversation as they're planning to visit an art museum, whereas Speaker B's interest in concerts aligns with their recent concert attendance. However, the MEMORY does not capture specific details or prior interactions mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT that would make it more helpful or causally connected, such as the specific details about the art museum or the conversation about fireworks and Disney. Additionally, Speaker A's interest in trying different foods and shopping is not reflected in the current dialogue, thereby not adding much to the immediate context. The MEMORY lacks cohesion and does not fully support the development of the conversation as presented in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
