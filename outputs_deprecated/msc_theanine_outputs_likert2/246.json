Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I loaded up on repellent like you said and I also grabbed a few of those mosquito repellent bracelets, I figured why not!\nSpeaker B: Have you been hiking lately?\nSpeaker A: Yes I did actually. I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me.\nSpeaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway?\nSpeaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day! I'll make it as fun as possible.\nSpeaker B: I will someday. just not in the summer when all the bugs are out! Where do you go hiking the most?\nSpeaker A: I like to go hiking in the local trails here. I am familiar with them and there's so many routes that I can take. Sadly, the bugs are as bad here as they are anywhere else.....\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is a personal trainer who loves camping in remote areas. This causes Speaker B to recently go on a long hike and enjoy it. Speaker A's Appalachian Trail hike will last for 10 days.\nSpeaker B enjoys taking cruises and is not as into the outdoors as Speaker A. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking as free activities. Speaker B gets scared by bugs and creepy crawlies in the outdoors. Speaker B shared tips on repelling mosquitos using sprays with 20% DEET and other active ingredients.\nSpeaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking as free activities. Speaker B gets scared by bugs and creepy crawlies in the outdoors.

    "raw_prediction": "I can imagine the bugs being quite bothersome. Maybe I'll join you for a hike in the fall when they're not as bad.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information about both Speaker A and Speaker B's attitudes towards outdoor activities, which is somewhat helpful in generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights Speaker B's dislike for bugs and interest in cruises, which aligns with the context where Speaker B mentions not wanting to hike in the summer due to bugs. Additionally, Speaker A's enjoyment of hiking and camping is noted, which fits with the dialogue where Speaker A mentions leading friends on a hike. However, the MEMORY includes some repetitive information and also contains details that are not directly relevant or naturally connected to the current conversation, such as Speaker A's Appalachian Trail hike and the length of it. This makes the MEMORY moderately helpful but not fully optimal for generating a next response based on the dialogue provided."
