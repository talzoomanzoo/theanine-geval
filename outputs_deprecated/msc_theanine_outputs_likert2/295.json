Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Black widow movie was awesome. We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. [Speaker B has 4 brothers and sisters, enjoys taking their houseboat out, and works as a bartender.] - (SameTopic) - [Speaker A and their brother enjoy going to a Brazilian steakhouse for dinner.] - (React) - [Speaker B's brother also enjoys Brazilian food, particularly steak.] \n2. [Speaker A is involved in healing work and mentioned hot latina salsa.] - (React) - [Speaker B's sister joined them on the water and is taking a nap in a hammock.] - (SameTopic) - [Speaker B's family likes to dance on the boat at night under the stars.]\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains some potentially relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT in the form of Speaker B and their brother enjoying Brazilian food, which could connect with Speaker A's mention of enjoying Brazilian foods. However, the structure of the memory and lack of strong causality or clear connection between the sentences make it not very helpful for generating a direct response related to the context. The memory mentions activities like taking a houseboat out, working as a bartender, and dancing on a boat, which don't directly relate to the topic of the movie 'Black Widow' or Brazilian foods. The lack of a clear connection between these memories and the context makes the memory less helpful."
