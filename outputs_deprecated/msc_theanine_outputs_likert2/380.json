Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I am thinking about getting a new tattoo for my mom to match the one for my dad. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is planning to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest, as it is their favorite tattoo dedicated to their late father. \nSpeaker A, who has 5 tattoos including one dedicated to their late father, has decided to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that can be useful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It informs that Speaker A is planning to get a portrait of their father's face as a part of their new tattoo, which ties into the conversation about getting a tattoo to honor their parents. The fact that Speaker A has a tattoo already dedicated to their late father and is planning to match it with another one for their mother is a helpful piece of information. This highlights Speaker A's sentiment and the meaningful intent behind their tattoos. However, there is some redundancy in the MEMORY, as the same information is repeated, which slightly affects the natural flow and connection. Thus, the MEMORY is mostly helpful but could be improved by removing the repetition."
