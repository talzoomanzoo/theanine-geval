Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\nSpeaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\nSpeaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\nSpeaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Speaker A used to help their father on a farm in the past, while Speaker B's dad works on smaller projects and has never been involved in a major Hollywood film. Speaker B now creates horror movies with their dad, coming up with plot ideas through creative conversations.\n\n2. Speaker B's father was involved in producing horror movies, which influenced Speaker B's favorite genre. Speaker A has a passion for producing horror movies and believes everyone loves them. Speaker A also likes mid-century design and is a fan of horror movies.\n\n3. Speaker B's father was involved in producing horror movies, which influenced Speaker B's favorite genre. As a result, Speaker B's dad's work on smaller projects allows him more free time for hobbies like fishing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That must have been quite a shocking moment on set! It sounds like working on horror movies involves some unexpected twists and turns.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about Speaker B's involvement in horror movie production, indicating that their father was also involved and influenced Speaker B's interest in the genre. This is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as it explains Speaker B's background and passion for horror movies. However, MEMORY also includes details that are not directly connected or necessary for the conversation at hand, such as the specifics about Speaker A's interests in mid-century design and farming, and Speaker B's dad's hobbies. While these may provide some context, they do not directly aid in generating a relevant next response for Speaker A. The sentences in MEMORY lack strong, natural connections and causality that would enhance the dialogue's continuity and relevancy significantly."
