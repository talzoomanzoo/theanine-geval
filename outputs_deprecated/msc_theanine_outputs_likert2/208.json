Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I met this guy at work who's wife is an athletic trainer, they asked me to pass their info on to you to discuss possible internships!\nSpeaker B: That would be great- thanks so much!

    "raw_prediction": "I work as a physical therapist, helping patients recover from injuries and improve their overall physical well-being. It's a rewarding field that combines my passion for sports and medicine.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information concerning the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically the details about Speaker B's interest in sports medicine and the internship hunt. This background could aid in generating a meaningful response that connects to their field of study and internship aspirations. However, other details like Speaker B's mother running a local high school or Speaker B learning to surf are not directly tied to the current dialogue and their helpfulness is limited. Additionally, the repetitive information about Speaker B being a college student and playing soccer could have been streamlined to enhance clarity and relevance. Overall, while there is relevant information, it could be more focused and succinct to better support the dialogue."
