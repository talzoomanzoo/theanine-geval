Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens?\nSpeaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month\nSpeaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.  Where are you going on vacation?\nSpeaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there!\nSpeaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo?\nSpeaker B: Their zoo is pretty good! It's always crowded, of course, but they have pandas so I'm happy. I would say it's bigger than the DC zoo, but I like that the DC zoo has fewer people.\nSpeaker A: That sounds awesome.  I haven't been to the zoo in so long.  I wish I could go.\nSpeaker B: You should go with your sister! she can bring her dog. They probably have all kinds of exotic birds...\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B enjoy visiting the zoo and discussing hobbies and interests. Speaker B's girlfriend loves pandas and penguins at the zoo, and they go there regularly. Speaker A has been to the zoo before and likes seeing exotic birds. Speaker A prefers cockatoos over kittens as pets. \nSpeaker A's sister recently got married, which was exciting for them. Speaker A enjoys pandas and penguins at the zoo and goes with their sister. This caused Speaker A's sister to become a dog person with a yellow lab. Speaker B is willing to be a cool uncle to his sister's future children but does not want kids of his own. \nSpeaker B, who has a cat that recently had a kitten, also enjoys visiting the zoo. Speaker A enjoys pandas and penguins at the zoo and goes with their sister. This causes Speaker A's sister to become a dog person with a yellow lab. Speaker B is open to being a cool uncle to his sister's future children but does not want kids of his own.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information such as Speaker A and B's interest in zoos and exotic birds and Speaker B's girlfriend's love for pandas and penguins, which are related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT discussing a trip to the zoo. However, the MEMORY is somewhat repetitive and includes details irrelevant to the immediate topic, such as Speaker A's sister getting married and Speaker B's willingness to be a cool uncle. The MEMORY also lacks a clear and natural connection or flow in some parts, with information being repeated and not well-structured, which makes it less helpful in generating a coherent response related to the current conversation about Speaker B's trip to the San Diego Zoo."
