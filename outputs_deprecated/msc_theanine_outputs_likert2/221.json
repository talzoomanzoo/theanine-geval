Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself!\nSpeaker B: That's super unfortunate, How do you get Journey to not eat the food?\nSpeaker A: Journey can open the fridge, maybe I should put a lock on it. Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too?\nSpeaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A loves animals, especially white tigers, and works as a zookeeper. Speaker A has penguins at the zoo and enjoys working with animals, offering Speaker B a chance to help out. Speaker A mentions having dogs and Speaker B admires them for their peaceful nature. Speaker B asks Speaker A if they have had a pet raccoon before. Speaker A has a pet raccoon named Journey and a bearded dragon named Sid. Speaker A's pet raccoon enjoys eating pizza. Speaker A has a pet raccoon and has a friend who found baby raccoons.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful information about the pets mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically Journey and Sid, which are relevant to the conversation. It reveals that Journey is a pet raccoon and she enjoys eating pizza, which directly connects to the incident discussed in the context where she ate a whole piece by herself. This background information supports the continuation and depth of the dialogue regarding pets getting into food. Additionally, it confirms that Sid is a bearded dragon, which directly answers Speaker B's question about Sid attempting to get into food. \n\nWhile MEMORY offers relevant information, some sections include unnecessary details about Speaker A's job as a zookeeper and their love for white tigers, which may not be entirely relevant to the specific context of preventing pets from eating food. However, the relevant sections are connected and aligned with the dialogue in a way that allows further conversation about pets and their behaviors."
