Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time? Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\nSpeaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\nSpeaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\nSpeaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.\nSpeaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A used to help their father on a farm in the past, which instilled a strong work ethic in them. This experience also shaped their appreciation for nature and the outdoors. \nSpeaker A recently moved to a new city and has two older brothers. Adjusting to a new environment has been challenging but exciting for Speaker A. They are looking forward to exploring the opportunities this city has to offer and reconnecting with their siblings. \nSpeaker B's father was involved in producing horror movies, which sparked Speaker B's interest in the genre. This influence led Speaker B to pursue a career in creating horror movies themselves.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Movie blood is typically made of a mixture of ingredients like corn syrup, food coloring, and sometimes a thickening agent like cornstarch. It needs to look realistic on camera but also be safe for the actors.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant background information about Speaker B's involvement in horror movie production, which directly relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly Speaker B's interest in producing horror movies. This connection helps in understanding the motivation behind Speaker B's choice of career and can aid in generating appropriate responses related to their profession and interests. \n\nHowever, much of the MEMORY, including Speaker A's past experiences and recent life changes, is not directly relevant to the current conversation about horror movies and Speaker B's career in that field. Additionally, while Speaker B's father's influence is mentioned, more details on how this influence plays out in Speaker B's current work could provide deeper context and connectivity. The sentences providing background are naturally structured, but more direct links between past and current dialogue would improve its helpfulness. Thus, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful but could have been more targeted to the specific context of the ongoing conversation."
