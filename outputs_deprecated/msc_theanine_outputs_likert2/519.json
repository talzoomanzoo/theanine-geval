Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: When is your first music concert this summer?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B drove over 1000 miles to see their favorite band, Three Dog Night.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context for Speaker B's background and interests in music, which is relevant to the dialogue context about a music concert. Speaker B's interest in attending music concerts and their anticipation of summer tour schedules can help Speaker B generate a relevant response to Speaker A's question. The MEMORY includes Speaker B's past experience of driving long distances for concerts, which demonstrates their passion for music and anticipation of future events. However, the MEMORY contains some irrelevant information, such as Speaker B's family background and origins, which does not directly help in generating the next response. Additionally, some sentences are repetitive, and the overall connection between the details provided could be more coherent to improve the relevance and causal linkage."
