Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I just went on a great nature walk that I think you would like.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys reading fantasy books and recommends \"A Game of Thrones\" by George R because Speaker A also enjoyed reading 'Redwall' growing up and keeps an eye out for similar books. \nSpeaker B is an artist who walks through nature for work and finds inspiration for their artwork during nature walks. Speaker B lives in the country, loves nature, and works with animals. Speaker B is interested in Pilates but dislikes the idea of having to follow specific steps in exercise.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds wonderful! I always find so much inspiration in nature.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe memory provides relevant information about Speaker B's interests and lifestyle that could inform a future response. Knowing that Speaker B is an artist who finds inspiration in nature is especially useful in this context, as well as the fact that they live in the country and love nature. This information creates a clear connection and relevance to Speaker A's statement about going on a nature walk that Speaker B may enjoy. However, the details about Speaker A's book preferences and Speaker B's interest in Pilates, while interesting, appear less directly relevant to the immediate dialogue about nature walks. Overall, the memory is useful but could be more concise by focusing more on the aspects of nature walks and how they relate to Speaker B's current interests."
