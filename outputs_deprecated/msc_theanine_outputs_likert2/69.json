Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play? \nSpeaker B: I don't know play instrument. Only  I enjoy rock music.\nSpeaker A: ah right, who's your favourite rock band?\nSpeaker B: I'm big fan of aerosmith. When do you learn music. Whom teach you?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B enjoys listening to Sublime a lot while relaxing on the beach and is looking forward to taking a break from work to go fishing. Speaker B also finds fishing easier than surfing but is interested in trying surfing, and is willing to teach Speaker A how to fish and cook.\n\nSpeaker A wants to see Sublime live one day but doesn't attend many concerts other than the ones their band plays in. Speaker A is in a band where they play the drums, write music, and have 4 members including the singer who is their best friend. Additionally, Speaker A is a musician.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information related to music and Speaker A's involvement in a band, which might help generate a response about their musical background. However, most of the MEMORY content is not directly relevant to the immediate DISCUSSION CONTEXT, which focuses on rock music and specific bands. The details about fishing, surfing, and wanting to see Sublime aren't highly helpful or connected to the current topic of conversation. Additionally, the connection between the two speakers' interests and activities is not clearly demonstrated, which limits its relevancy and helpfulness."
