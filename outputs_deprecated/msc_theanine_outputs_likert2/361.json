Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you play any Resident Evil this week?\nSpeaker B: I sure did. There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you?\nSpeaker A: I don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions?\nSpeaker B: Unfortunately I mainly play games similar to RE. I don't know why I like them so much. I remember when I was little my brother play Doom and it gave me nightmares for a week. What genre of games you like?\nSpeaker A: I like all kinds of games. I like party, fighting, RPGs, shooters, action, adventure, and puzzle games. I enjoy playing Jurassic Park: World but I'd like to find another game to play. The storm means I'll be inside for a bit, so I think I'll curl up with some pizza and just zone out. Do you like to do anything else besides game when it's rainy?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\nSpeaker A prefers tamer video games and is not a fan of horror movies. Speaker A is hesitant to try playing Resident Evil but enjoys playing Jurassic Park: World. Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, with Speaker A trying out Resident Evil.\nSpeaker B is interested in trying the Jurassic Park game.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information, such as Speaker A's hesitation with horror games and preference for Jurassic Park: World, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A mentions these preferences. However, the MEMORY also repeats the same information twice, which adds no additional value or insight into the conversation. Additionally, the MEMORY suggests that Speaker A and Speaker B plan to play games together, but this is not mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT provided and could be misleading. Finally, the mention of Speaker B's interest in trying the Jurassic Park game is slightly relevant, but not directly useful for generating the next response in the context provided. Overall, the MEMORY does not add much helpful information for generating the next response, and its repetition and slight inconsistency with the dialogue context limit its helpfulness."
