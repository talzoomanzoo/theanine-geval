Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you studied other martial arts as well?\nSpeaker B: I haven't!

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker B's involvement in karate, which directly relates to the conversation topic about martial arts. This connection can help build a natural continuation of the conversation, as Speaker A might inquire more about Speaker B's karate experience or their other activities. However, there is a lot of repetition and additional information regarding Speaker B's career considerations and education plans, which are not directly relevant to the current context focused on martial arts. The sentences are somewhat scattered and not entirely connected in a way that demonstrates clear development or causality regarding the martial arts topic."
