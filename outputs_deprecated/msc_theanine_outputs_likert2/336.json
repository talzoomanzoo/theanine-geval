Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Okay, so, I watched Pulp Fiction, and I loved it! Thank you for the recommendation.\nSpeaker B: Of course. I recommend that movie to everyone I meet. I think I've watched it over one hundred times. So what is the next movie on your list to watch soon?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is interested in watching movies, mentioned Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman. Speaker B is knowledgeable about movies and provides recommendations based on Speaker A's preferences. Speaker A relies on Speaker B for movie suggestions, mentioning a preference for comedies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful information that can help in generating the next response for Speaker A in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker A is interested in watching movies and has a preference for comedies, which could guide the next recommendation by Speaker B. Also, it mentions that Speaker A relies on Speaker B for movie suggestions, highlighting the trust in their knowledge. However, while it notes mention of Pulp Fiction, it does not directly connect back to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT's current interaction, specifically the movie Pulp Fiction itself being discussed. Despite this, the memory generally aligns with the ongoing discussion and would help to keep the conversation flowing appropriately, thereby being rated as a 4."
