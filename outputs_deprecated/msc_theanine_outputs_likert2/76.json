Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What instrument do you play? \nSpeaker B: I don't know play instrument.

    "raw_prediction": "I haven't been fishing in a while, but I'm hoping to go this weekend if the weather is nice.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provided is somewhat helpful in generating a response that aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives additional insights into Speaker B's preferences and lifestyle, such as their love for fishing and spending time near the ocean, and how they find fishing easier than surfing. This could tie into the conversation about surfing and fishing. The MEMORY also provides context on Speaker A's interests in music and surfing, which were mentioned in the conversation. Furthermore, it highlights some causality and connections, such as Speaker B's wish to learn surfing, which aligns with their interest in the conversation. The detail about Speaker B working at a doctor's office and not having time to surf anymore, along with their interest in considering surf lessons, adds depth to the context and could lead to further conversational topics. However, there are pieces of the MEMORY, like the writing and math skills, that do not directly connect with the current dialogue, which lowers its relevance slightly. Overall, while there are parts of the MEMORY that do not perfectly align, the majority of it provides relevant context that enhances understanding and aids in generating a informed response."
