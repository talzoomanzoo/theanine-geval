Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read.\nSpeaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting? \nSpeaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far.\nSpeaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes. \nSpeaker A: why don't you like books like that?\nSpeaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B's fascination with animals allows them to understand Speaker A's comparison of their grandchildren to animals. This is because Speaker A's grandchildren are old enough to entertain themselves with technology or watching TV. Additionally, Speaker A enjoys watching movies with their grandchildren. Speaker B, on the other hand, has a young son and finds solace in reading books, especially those about animals. This interest in animals is shared with Speaker A, who mentions watching movies with their grandchildren.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant background information regarding Speaker B's interest in animals, which connects to the ongoing conversation where Speaker B mentions their preference for animal books. However, there is a lack of clear development or causality regarding Speaker A's activities or interests beyond the generalized mention of watching movies with grandchildren, which does not directly relate to the immediate dialogue context about books and preferences. The connection between Speaker B's fascination with animals and their son is mentioned, but it doesn't significantly aid in generating a response to the current book-based conversation. Some improvement in cohesion and explicit relation to the immediate dialogue context would enhance the memory's helpfulness."
