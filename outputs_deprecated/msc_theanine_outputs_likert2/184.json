Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away. Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know. \nSpeaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like.\nSpeaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too.\nSpeaker B: Nice! Is anyone coming with you?\nSpeaker A: Just my doggy Drunky.  You never know,  I might meet a nice lady out there. \nSpeaker B: Totally.  There will be a bunch of women there and it'll be easy to strike up conversations.  Just be confident and I'm sure you could walk away with a bunch of numbers.\nSpeaker A: Oh, I definitely will. Thanks for the motivation. Is this going to me your first festival?\nSpeaker B: No, I used to go to them all the time.  This will be my first one in a while and probably my last since my wife and I are about to have our baby.\nSpeaker A: You could make this one festival your \"escape\" every year. Don't give up the festivals, you need to have something to keep you happy.\n\nMEMORY:\n[Speaker A does not live in Mexico but likes Mexican food and women.] - (SameTopic) - [Speaker B's wife is pregnant and currently in the second trimester, still working.]  \n[Speaker B is a mechanic who enjoys working on cars.] - (React) - [Speaker B is not going out drinking much due to their wife's pregnancy.]  \n[Speaker A owns a Subaru Legacy and mentions having a baby on the way.] - (React) - [Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy.]\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's a good point. I'll have to see how things go with the baby and maybe I can still make it out to a festival every now and then.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that could help Speaker B in generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, the details that Speaker B's wife is pregnant, and they are experiencing some jealousy towards Speaker A's ability to enjoy live music, tie in with the ongoing discussion in the context about the festival and Speaker B's future family responsibilities. This connection could help Speaker B's response to be more nuanced and informed by their personal circumstances. However, not all parts of MEMORY are equally helpful or well-connected to the dialogue. For example, Speaker A's liking for Mexican food and their ownership of a Subaru Legacy are mentioned, but these details do not naturally connect to the Bluegrass festival discussion or the suggestion of making the festival an annual escape. More direct connections or causality between MEMORY and the ongoing dialogue could enhance relevance and helpfulness."
