Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I didn't watch my grandkids today so I checked out a new book to read.\nSpeaker B: It's nice to have a break. Did you find the book sufficiently exciting? \nSpeaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys spending time with her 8 grandchildren, who are now old enough to entertain themselves with technology or TV. This allows Speaker A to suggest taking naps during quiet times.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Sounds like a thrilling read! Sometimes a good book can be just as entertaining as spending time with the grandkids.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about Speaker A's family life and their availability to have free time due to the grandchildren being self-sufficient. This background information can help in understanding why Speaker A had the time to check out a new book, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, it does not directly contribute much towards the crime drama book or elaborate on the connection to Speaker B's question about whether the book was exciting. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it included information that links back to the subject of reading or Speaker A's book preferences. Additionally, while the background information is nice to know, it doesn't directly assist in generating a precise follow-up response from Speaker B regarding the specific topics of the book discussion. Therefore, the score reflects partial relevance and connection to the conversation at hand."
