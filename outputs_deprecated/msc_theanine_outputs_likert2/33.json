Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I would tell about my progress of planning my trip to Sweden.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is from Sweden and mentioned playing tennis and going to church on Sunday. This reminds Speaker A that they have a cousin in Sweden but have not visited the country yet. Speaker A is considering visiting their cousin in Sweden and needs to save money for the trip. Speaker B recommends checking out the volcanoes in Sweden for a unique experience.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides quite helpful information for generating a response relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that Speaker B is from Sweden, which is pertinent since Speaker A is planning a trip to Sweden. It also includes Speaker B's past activities and suggestions, such as playing tennis, going to church, and recommending volcanoes, which can be useful for Speaker A's travel plans. Additionally, the MEMORY notes Speaker A's intention to visit a cousin in Sweden and the need to save money, which shows the progression and connection of past conversations. However, the mention of \"volcanoes in Sweden\" could be seen as slightly inaccurate, as Sweden is not known for volcanoes, which might slightly affect the naturalness. Nonetheless, overall, there is a clear link between the MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making it helpful."
