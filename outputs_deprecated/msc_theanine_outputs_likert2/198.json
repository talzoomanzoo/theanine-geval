Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: What position did you play, when you played soccer in college?\nSpeaker B: I ended up being the goalkeeper for most games, not the most exciting position. \nSpeaker A: Exciting when it really counts though! Do you miss it?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket, but now plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week. Despite not being into music, Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments. \nSpeaker A is a college student studying Humanities and wants to finish college before looking for a job, expressing interest in working in HR and appreciating the recommendation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I do miss it sometimes, but it's definitely a lot of pressure being a goalkeeper.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some general background information about Speaker A, such as their previous part-time work and their studies in Humanities, which could potentially relate to their interest in HR. However, the information about Speaker A now playing as a soccer striker and having a match next week is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT since it relates to soccer, but it does not directly connect well to the context of the conversation, which focuses more on Speaker B's college soccer experience. Moreover, there's no direct causality or clear development between the sentences in MEMORY that ties back to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT effectively. Overall, MEMORY contains limited relevant information and lacks natural connectivity to provide significant assistance for generating the next response."
