Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you decided to get one of my friend's kittens?\nSpeaker B: I'm thinking about it, but I'm planning on going on vacation in a week so It'd have to be next month\nSpeaker A: Alright, just keep me posted.  Where are you going on vacation?\nSpeaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there!\nSpeaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo?\nSpeaker B: Their zoo is pretty good! It's always crowded, of course, but they have pandas so I'm happy. I would say it's bigger than the DC zoo, but I like that the DC zoo has fewer people.\nSpeaker A: That sounds awesome.  I haven't been to the zoo in so long.  I wish I could go.\nSpeaker B: You should go with your sister! she can bring her dog. They probably have all kinds of exotic birds...\nSpeaker A: That's a great idea!  I'm not sure how good her dog would do around other animals though.  She always barks like crazy whenever she sees any kind of animal.\nSpeaker B: Oh, that's a good point. Maybe keep her away from the small rodent house and reptiles, eh?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys gardening and reading, while Speaker B enjoys visiting the zoo, especially to see pandas and penguins. Speaker A decides to go to the zoo with their sister, who is a dog person with a yellow lab. Speaker B's girlfriend, who loves pandas and penguins, has a noisy cockatoo and they visit the zoo regularly. Speaker B is open to being a cool uncle to his sister's future children but does not want kids of his own.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe memory provides some relevant information for generating a next response based on the dialogue context. It highlights Speaker B's interest in visiting the zoo, particularly to see pandas, which aligns with the conversation. However, there are elements in the memory that are not entirely relevant or naturally connected to the dialogue, such as Speaker A's enjoyment of gardening and reading, or Speaker B's stance on having children. These details do not contribute to the current conversation about visiting the zoo or considering getting a kitten. Additionally, while the information about Speaker B's girlfriend and her interests is somewhat relevant, it is not directly connected to the ongoing dialogue and might not help in continuing the conversation in a fluid and natural way. Overall, the memory has some relevant points but lacks strong cohesion and direct relevance to the dialogue context."
