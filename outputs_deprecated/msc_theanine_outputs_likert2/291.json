Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I found a lot of beginner recipes online for you to try. If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \nSpeaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with?\nSpeaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point.\nSpeaker A: Yes, it contains eggs.  I think you would do well with the fried rice. It's best to cook the rice the day before.  \nSpeaker B: I didn't know that. Why cook the rice beforehand? Is it better to age rice or something?\nSpeaker A: The rice needs to be cool before adding to the pan.  Are you able to take a passenger along in you truck?\nSpeaker B: Oh! That makes since. I didn't realize that the temperature made a difference when frying rice. As for the truck, Yes I can. But, depending on what company I'm working for at the time, they often set restrictions on passengers.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A enjoys cooking and baking, possibly considering turning it into a business. Speaker A primarily cooks Indian food and bakes a lot of rice dishes. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken. \nSpeaker A believes tennis is beneficial for building muscle and stamina. Speaker A bakes muffins and bread but is conscious of their impact on their weight. Speaker A is interested in running a business with their cooking skills. Speaker A recommends the pressure cooker for its efficiency and ease of use, suggesting it to Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "It's great that you can take passengers sometimes in your truck. It could be a nice way to share meals with others on the road.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some insights into Speaker A's interests and expertise in cooking, particularly with regard to Indian cuisine and the use of a pressure cooker. However, it does not directly connect or provide causality relevant to the specific discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is about beginner recipes, particularly shrimp fried rice and its cooking techniques. The information about Speaker A's cooking interests and potential business aspirations is not directly helpful in generating a response to Speaker B's questions or comments in the given dialogue context, thus making the memory less helpful overall. Furthermore, there's a mention of tennis and weight consciousness without clear relevance to the dialogue, which further dilutes the coherence and utility of the MEMORY."
