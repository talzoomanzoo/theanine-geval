Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: So I decided against Marmalade for the kitten's name. We're going with Pumpkin!\nSpeaker B: Wow I like it. Why did you decide to change its name? \nSpeaker A: Pumpkin spice is a thing I love, and Ginger is a spice too - they are the spice girls! \nSpeaker B: I see what you meant. Plus the color is beautiful orange. I want to see them together, even I am not a cat person they must be cute together at that time. Once the kitten grows up, situation gonna change to me. How are they, they are doing well?\nSpeaker A: Marmalade is orange too but this is better because the baby is sassy and climbs up my leg to sit on my shoulder. I don't understand how you are not a cat person when you have such a large heart for stray kittens.\nSpeaker B: hehe you're right. But i can't explain that why I am not a cat person to you sorry. How's the weather like today, still good weather to have iced tea out there?\nSpeaker A: It's beautiful. I'm sitting outside while the Spice Girls are chasing bugs in the grass. What did your kids name your cats?\nSpeaker B: ohh so nice sounds like you are enjoying the weather. Still we are discussing about that. Did not name them yet. Also I want to put them back since I am not a big fan of cat\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B loves dogs and Speaker A has a kitten from their cat and enjoys taking them on trips. Speaker A usually leaves their cats with a friend while traveling. Speaker A and Speaker B have a light-hearted and humorous conversation about their pets and travels. \nSpeaker A has a cat that recently had a kitten, Speaker A has a kitten from their cat and enjoys taking them on trips. Speaker A usually leaves their cats with a friend while traveling. Speaker B is not a cat person but ends up taking care of stray cats brought home by kids.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Maybe you can let the kids decide on the names for the cats, it could be fun for them! Or maybe they'll just end up being called Cat 1 and Cat 2.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some beneficial information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains relevant details such as Speaker A having a kitten from their cat and enjoying traveling with them, and Speaker B not being a cat person but taking care of stray cats brought home by their kids. This background helps in understanding Speaker B's hesitation about keeping the cats and aligns with the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT of Speaker A discussing the names of their cats.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY is somewhat repetitive and doesn't provide additional context on how Speaker A and Speaker B's interactions have developed beyond early points mentioned (like their humorous conversation), which may limit its usefulness. Additionally, while it connects to the present dialogue, it lacks specific events or causality that would strengthen the relevance and connectivity for crafting a more contextually informed response."
