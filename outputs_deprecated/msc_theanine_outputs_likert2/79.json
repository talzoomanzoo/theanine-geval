    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids?\nSpeaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call!\nSpeaker A: I have had to learn just to keep in touch with my family because of my hours at my job. It is not easy, I understand.\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A is a librarian and loves kids, mentioning having 3 children. This leads to Speaker B mentioning having grandkids, implying they are older and have a family of their own. Speaker A has kids and is busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. Speaker B has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park. Speaker A's other children are addicted to tablets and phones, unlike the youngest one who is interested in music. Speaker B has grandkids who are more interested in phones and tablets than musical instruments. Speaker A has children and grandchildren, with at least one child interested in learning the flute.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I can see how that would be challenging with your schedule. It's important to adapt to stay connected with your loved ones.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful context for understanding the Dialogue Context, specifically that Speaker B has grandchildren and prefers traditional communication methods over technology. This is relevant to Speaker B's statement about preferring phone calls. Additionally, there are connections between Speaker A's experience with technology due to work and Speaker B's family dynamics with technology use. However, the MEMORY includes many extraneous details that do not directly enhance the ability to generate a relevant next response. Particularly, details about children's interests in music or Speaker A being a librarian are not directly useful to the current conversation, making the MEMORY less focused and cohesive. Therefore, while there is some relevant information, it's scattered and partially useful for generating a response in a natural manner."
