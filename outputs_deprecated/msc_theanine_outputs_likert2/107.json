    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Have you found out any more ideas for what you would like to do on your Alaska trip with your friends?\nSpeaker B: I am thinking I might want to do sledding with dogs while I am there, but I need to figure out if it is daylight or darkness in Alaska right now. My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do.\nSpeaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars.\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I think they go dark for a couple months and then have daylight for a couple months! I actually like night time, but having daylight all the time will make me crazy lol. Yeah I kind of hope it's dark for the camping but it will be very cold. I have heard Alaska has delicious ice cream. I want to try that while I'm there, \nSpeaker A: You'd have to get some serious blackout curtains for when it was daylight lol! You'll have to stock up on some warm essentials before heading out. You definitely don't want to get stuck in a bad situation in the cold, especially if you're alone. I bet they have great ice cream! You'll have to tell me about it when you get back!\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I need to call my friend and find out what season they are in so I can pack accordingly. I will take pictures of the ice cream too so I can tell you about it. I wonder if there are a lot of bears there? I don't like bears either.\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty sure they have grizzlies up there. You better pack something to fend them off too just in case. I bet your friend knows everything you'd need to keep them away.\nSpeaker B: I will bring whatever they let me bring on the airplane, but I am really counting on my friend to help me out with the local customs lol. Do you know if Rocky and Bullwinkle were from Alaska? \nSpeaker A: No, they were from Minnesota. Are you going to have your friend be your hiking guide?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A and Speaker B share a sense of humor and make each other laugh during the conversation. Speaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking. Speaker A mentions the outdoor activities they plan to do in Alaska, such as hiking.\nSpeaker B is going to Alaska for a vacation in two weeks and has some experience with flying on airplanes. Speaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking. Speaker A and Speaker B are planning a trip to Alaska together.\nSpeaker A and Speaker B share a sense of humor and make each other laugh during the conversation. Speaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking. Speaker A talks about the common perceptions of Alaska being cold, dark, and known for oil drilling.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "Haha, I can only hope my friend is a better guide than Rocky and Bullwinkle would be!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some general information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B's upcoming trip to Alaska and Speaker A's familiarity with Alaska and its outdoor activities. However, the MEMORY contains repetitive sentences and lacks specific references to the discussed topics, like the unique daylight cycles and potential encounters with bears. The information does not establish clear causality or development of previous interactions, making it less helpful in generating a specific and contextual response for the ongoing conversation. Elements of humor are mentioned but not directly linked to the context of the trip, further reducing the MEMORY's helpfulness."
