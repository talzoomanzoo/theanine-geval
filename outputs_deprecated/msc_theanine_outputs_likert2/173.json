Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: Did you look for tickets to visit me?\nSpeaker B: I have been watching the airfare. I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week?\nSpeaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day\nSpeaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through\nSpeaker A: Actually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to it. Do you think I will need to rent a car when I'm there, or is it possible to walk and bike in the summer? I always picture huge amounts of snow but I'm not sure if it's like that all year round.\nSpeaker A: I would definitely recommend looking for a rental car to have on hand. There is a town within walking distance from me, but it can be dangerous to walk with the wolves and elk around, especially at night.\nSpeaker B: I imagine so!!! I wouldn't want to run into a wolf! Ok. I will add car rental to my plans. Do you get scared with your dogs, that you will run into wildilfe like that?\nSpeaker A: I think I'm more afraid of the wildlife than my dogs are. If I had to, I think I could muster the courage to face the animals out here, but I will happily avoid them when possible. With you around, I'd feel much better, as well. How do you feel about being that close to wildlife?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker A, who has blue eyes and blonde hair, invited Speaker B to visit and mentioned looking into flights, which causes Speaker B to plan to visit Speaker A and be interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n\nSpeaker B enjoys warm days, cool mornings, and eating poached eggs, and Speaker A mentions the \"midnight sun\" phenomenon in Alaska where the sun does not set during the summer. Speaker A also talks about wildlife, including elk and wolves, which causes Speaker A to make poached eggs for breakfast and take sleds pulled by dogs.\n\nSpeaker A drives a smart car and used to have a long commute in Alaska, and suggests going on hikes in Alaska to see wildlife and mentions glaciers as a potential attraction, while Speaker B is planning to visit Speaker A and is interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context for Speaker A and Speaker B's discussion about visiting and engaging in activities like concerts and possibly being around wildlife. However, the details are somewhat disjointed and not all relevant or accurately connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. There are mentions of the midnight sun and poached eggs that do not directly relate to the topics discussed in the context. Additionally, the MEMORY includes content about petting a wolf and taking dog sleds, which are not part of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT provided. The structure lacks clarity in demonstrating direct causality or relevancy to the immediate interaction between the speakers, making it less helpful for generating the next response accurately."
