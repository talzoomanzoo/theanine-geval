Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: How is your daughter doing? Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her?\nSpeaker B: Hi there, hope you are wlll and managing to save up for your Italy trip?  Thank for asking about the Greek mythology study, we are doing very well. It helps because i am so passionate about it and hope to get to the Greek islands soon\nSpeaker A: Yes I have been saving up for another trip to Italy! I can't wait. It's planned for next Spring. Do you have any plans to go back to Italy in the future?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B has suggested California as a destination for Speaker A's trip, and also mentioned trying surfing before but not being very good at it. Additionally, Speaker B expressed interest in visiting Greece for the history and Greek mythology. Speaker A, on the other hand, is fascinated by the architecture of Italy and enjoys studying history, especially through reading and watching documentaries. Speaker A is planning to travel to Italy alone for Spring Break and has friends from Europe meeting up with them.

    "raw_prediction": "I'd love to go back to Italy someday, especially to explore more of the historical sites and architecture. Greece is also on my list, so maybe we'll swap travel stories soon!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information that can help generate a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Speaker B's interest in Greek mythology and visiting Greece, which aligns with the current conversation about Greek mythology and Speaker B's passion for it. It also provides context on Speaker A's interest in history and architecture, as well as their upcoming trip to Italy, which connects to their discussion about travel plans. Though some details, like Speaker B's previous suggestion of California, are not directly relevant to the current dialogue, the MEMORY overall provides helpful background and demonstrates connections between speakers' interests and plans. The information is structured well, showing causality and relevance to the current context."
