Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Speaker A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally connected, representing the development (e.g., causality) of two speakers' past interactions.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response or are structured in an unnatural way that does not tell us the connection, relevancy, or causality of events.\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the causality/relevancy is clearly demonstrated.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully. \n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above. \n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. Always generate your helpfulness score after the phrase `Helpfulness Score:`\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nSpeaker A: I have been learning how to play guitar so maybe I could play something for you when we meet for the barbecue.\nSpeaker B: That would be great maybe you can help me pick a color scheme for my living room, you might want to bring some bug spray too, the mosquitos here are prety bad.\nSpeaker A: I think white with small details of like blue or red is a nice color scheme. What other color schemes did you have in mind? I'll bring over the lamp I have that'll get rid of bugs!\nSpeaker B: I just know i have to do something about this green and purple. I'm thinking of getting some patio furniture also, where did you get yours?\n\nMEMORY:\nSpeaker B is looking to redecorate their house and is considering adding more colorful elements to the room to make the purple sofas work. Speaker A recently bought new furniture for their house, including a couch, recliner, and patio furniture.\nSpeaker B regrets their green and purple color scheme, recently purchased purple sofas for their home, and is willing to give away their purple furniture.\nSpeaker B is in the process of renovating their house to meet their living standards with their pets and plans to meet up with Speaker A to discuss the furniture exchange. Speaker A has devices to keep bugs away and offers to share the product names with Speaker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:",

    "raw_prediction": "I got my patio furniture from a local store that had a great sale. I can share the details with you when we meet up.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information that could be useful for Speaker A in generating their next response. It captures the desire for Speaker B to redecorate their home and their dissatisfaction with the current green and purple color scheme, which is relevant to the ongoing discussion. It also notes Speaker B's willingness to give away their purple furniture, connecting directly to the color scheme conversation. Furthermore, it mentions Speaker A's ownership of bug-repellent devices, aligning with the conversation's bug spray suggestion. \n\nHowever, while the MEMORY contains useful details, it introduces unnecessary complexities by referencing a furniture exchange, which is not explicitly mentioned or planned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This might detract slightly from its overall helpfulness in a straightforward continuation of the dialogue. Nonetheless, it offers pertinent and interconnected insights that could influence how Speaker A responds, hence the relatively high score."
