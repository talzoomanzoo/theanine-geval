He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies!\nWhy do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?  \nYes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere!\nYou have a point.  It is nice to see puppies wagging their tail and just following you!  Changing topics, do you have any recipes with asparagus?  You know, it's such a popular vegetable, but I just don't know how to prepare it.\nI don't have recipes but I know how to make a good grilled asparagus. Are you looking to bolster your chef book?\nI sure am!  Grilled asparagus does sound good.  Do you pair the grilled asparagus with your fajitas?  What do you prefer, chicken or beef fajitas?\nI prefer chicken to beef. I pair it with beef fajitas andI think it's great to have with a glass of merlot. Do you like wine?\nYou're making me hungry!  Yes, I do love wine.  As a matter of fact, I used to live in the Bordeaux region in France, so my favorite wine is Bordeaux wine.  But I also love champagne and cognac.\nHaha, I know right? I lived in the Champagne region for a bit! Always wanted to go to Bordeaux. How was it there?\nI didn't know that you also lived in France for a while!  I love French food, especially the bread and fruit pastries.  Living in Bordeaux was fun!  I had the chance to visit all the prehistoric caves with paintings in the Southwest region of France.  Plus, Spain was just a few hours away by train, so I visited Spain quite a few times as well.  Oh, the good old times.  If only I were this excited about my career!\nThe French have the best food I have ever eaten plus the life style is so chill! I miss going to the bakeries in the mornings to get freshly baked baguettes and croissants. If you become a chef you could travel to different countries and workright?\n\n[MEMORY]\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Potential Career Paths', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A suggests different career paths to Speaker B and they discuss working in the culinary field.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: I'm not really sure.
