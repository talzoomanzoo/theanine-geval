    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad you had a break! Yes, the book was quite exciting. It was a nice change of pace from babysitting.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\n\nBrief explanation: The current DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses on Speaker A having a break from babysitting their grandkids and checking out a new book. The MEMORY primarily discusses Speaker A's usual activities with their grandkids and how often they are being babysat. It does not directly relate to the new book or whether it was exciting or not. Therefore, the information in MEMORY about babysitting is not needed to respond to the immediate question about the book.\nJudgement: No"
