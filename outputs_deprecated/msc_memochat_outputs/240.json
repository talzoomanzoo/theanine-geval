    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear that you're taking precautions against mosquitoes! It's important to stay protected, especially when you're out camping or hiking in the woods. Have a great time enjoying the outdoors!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context is about preparing with mosquito repellents, likely for an outdoor activity. The memory includes information about the speakers' interests in outdoor activities, including camping and hiking. While there is a connection between the need for repellents and spending time outdoors, the specific memory is not directly related to the current need for mosquito repellents. Therefore, this memory is not particularly helpful in generating the next response about mosquito repellents.\nJudgement: No"
