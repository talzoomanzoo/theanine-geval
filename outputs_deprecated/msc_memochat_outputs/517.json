Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon?\nYes!  As a matter of fact, I'm visiting my son that lives in Spain next month.  This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now!\nOh nice. You must be looking forward to it. He must have told you a lot about her. Do you think you would like her?\nI think so.  She seems like a very sweet girl and she seems to care deeply about my son, so that's what matters most.  You know, maybe I can stop by and visit you as well, since you live in Europe.  France, Spain, Italy?  Where are you living now?\nBless her, that's good to hear. That would be great! I live in Portugal. It's not too far from Spain. We can always arrange something. How long would you be there for?\nI'm planning to stay in Spain for three weeks.  Since you live in Portugal, I'd love to stop by for a visit if you're free this coming month.  I've always wanted to visit Lisbon.  It has the world's longest bridge!\nThat'a great idea. We have a holiday house just outside of Lisbon. You are welcome to lodge with us.\nSounds great!  I'm already very excited about my trip to Spain, and now I get to visit you in Lisbon!  I need to brush up on my Spanish and also start studying Portuguese.\nHaha, you've got your hands full then. Portuguese would be easier I believe. Spanish is a bit harder because it is spoken quicker. Would you be travelling with any company?\n\n[MEMORY]\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Son's Spanish Girlfriend', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A discusses his son's new Spanish girlfriend.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: My younger son would be so jealous.

    "raw_prediction": "That's true, Portuguese may be easier to learn compared to Spanish. I'll be traveling alone to Spain to visit my son, but I'm looking forward to meeting you in Lisbon during my trip!",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The dialogue context currently involves a discussion about travel, meeting up with a friend in Europe, and learning languages. Memory (2), related to meeting up plans during winter break, provides relevant past conversations that align with planning a visit, similar to the travel plans being discussed. Memory (1) about the son's Spanish girlfriend is less relevant since the topic has already been discussed extensively in the current context. Thus, for the purpose of travel and meeting plans, Memory (2) is relevant.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
