    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a good plan. Having your own place can definitely provide more independence and freedom. It's great that you'll be able to bring your pet snakes with you, they seem like fascinating companions.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The Dialogue Context primarily revolves around Speaker B's pet snakes and their characteristics. The MEMORY contains information about the names of the snakes, Hansel and Gretel, which is directly relevant to the conversation in the Dialogue Context. The mention of scuba diving experiences, while present in the MEMORY, is not directly useful for crafting the next response about the snakes or college living situations. Therefore, the MEMORY does contain some helpful information that can be used to generate a relevant response about the snakes.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
