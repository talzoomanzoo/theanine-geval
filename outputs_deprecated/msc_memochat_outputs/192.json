    "raw_prediction": "Birria tacos are a traditional Mexican dish typically made with stewed and seasoned meat, often beef or goat, served in a tortilla and usually topped with melted cheese. The meat is cooked until tender and flavorful, making for a delicious and savory taco experience. Would you like to try making birria tacos sometime?",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves a conversation about cooking garlic chicken, discussing spicy foods, and trying new foods such as street tacos. The MEMORY references past conversations about garlic chicken recipes and family dinners but does not add any new or necessary information to aid the current conversation. The garlic chicken topic in MEMORY is already part of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, so MEMORY does not offer additional insights for the response generation about Birra tacos or Mexican food preferences.\n\nJudgement: No"
