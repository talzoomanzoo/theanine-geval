    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a wonderful hobby! Collecting shells from around the world must be very interesting. Unfortunately, there is no direct evidence in the related dialogues about Speaker A's travel experiences. Would you like to ask Speaker A about their travel experiences?",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around work, personal experiences, and hobbies, particularly focusing on internships, the beach, and traveling. The MEMORY, on the other hand, contains information about an unemployed speaker, soccer, university life, and a kind mother but does not relate to the topics of the current conversation, which are crucial for future responses about travel and dune collecting.\nJudgement: No"
