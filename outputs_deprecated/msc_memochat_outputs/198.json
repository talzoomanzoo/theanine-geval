    "raw_prediction": "I see you used to play as a goalkeeper in college soccer. It may not have been the most exciting position, but it's crucial when it really counts. Do you miss being in that role?",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is focused on Speaker B's past experience playing soccer, particularly as a goalkeeper, and whether they miss playing. While the MEMORY mentions Speaker B playing intramural soccer and supporting Manchester United, this does not provide relevant information for the specific question about missing being a goalkeeper. The MEMORY does not contain helpful past information for generating a response about missing playing soccer.\n\nJudgement: No"
