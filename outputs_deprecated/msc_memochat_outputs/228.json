Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too?\nWell fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also?\nSid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways?\nThey've been better as I left my previous job so I'm spending more time with them, how do you manage to work full time and still keep those animals happy?\nI think working at the zoo so long has helped. Why did you leave your last job. Was that the one you were working in the warehouse? Sorry to hear about your dogs, it can be hard managing older animals.\nYea, that totally makes sense! I just wanted time off to spend with the dogs and look for a better job elsewhere, I'm hoping that I'll be able to get a job outside of a warehouse!\nThat is understandable. I didn't always think I would end up a zookeeper. Do you have anything in mind?\nWell, I really enjoy animals so I might think of applying to work in a zoo aswell! Is it a super busy job?\nThat sounds like a great idea! You would be surprised how busy it can be. Not every job is high demanding and you don't have to work with all the animals either.

I’ll take anything at this point and trust me you won’t regret it! Truly appreciate the referral... I feel good just thinking about the possibility:) ### Speaker A: I'll send them an email later today. I can't guarantee the work will be fabulous in any manner, usually the entry level positions start out cleaning enclosures and feeding less dangerous animals.

If you can get into a full time position they also offer benefits and help to pay for schooling so you can progress in the field more quickly! ### Speaker B: You have no idea how grateful I am for this opportunity!

    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY contains information about past conversations where Speaker A suggests Speaker B for a potential job opportunity at the zoo and mentions experiencing a somewhat repetitive and uninteresting job prior, in line with Speaker B's current situation. Additionally, Speaker A has previously expressed how much they enjoy working with animals at the zoo. This information could be helpful as it adds depth to the conversation about career changes and working with animals that is currently taking place in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\nJudgement: Yes"
