Can you tell me about it?\nYes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see. \nI definitely will, this sounds like such an amazing trip. How long has it been since you've been there yourself?\nI was in Greece last two years ago.   I am excited to go again soon!    At somepoint I would like to take a cruise around the islands there.  It seems like a neat way to see all the Islands in an easy way.   Have you ever taken a cruise?\nOnly once before when I was very young, so I don't remember much. It sounds like such a relaxing way to enjoy the day, though. Maybe we can plan a cruise together sometime.\nThat would be fun!  I go to Europe a lot so maybe a cruise in the Caribbean would be nice.  I would like to see Saint Lucia and Saint Thomas. \nOh, Europe? I'm already sold on the idea, sounds like a blast! I've never had a negative experience in Europe. Should we visit some of the capital cities?\nI would like to go to Paris.  Since I live in Amsterdam I could take the train down.  I have seen much and Italy and Greece but would love to go to Paris.  Have you been there before? \nOnly once, and I had a really great time there. The buildings were so beautiful and the food was delicious. Do you like French food?\n\n[MEMORY]\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Sightseeing Plans', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B discuss sightseeing priorities in Rome and Greece.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: I haven't really planned the trip out as it's so last minute!
