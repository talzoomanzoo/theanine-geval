Also, I have to deal with the penguins again in a bit, so I think I'll try your tip about using vinegar to get rid of the smell after work! ### Speaker B: Haha... ya I gotta earn that... I get it ;) Let me know how the vinegar works out ... ### Speaker A: You bet! How are your dogs doing? ### Speaker B: They are doing great, thanks! They rock... I mean, they are like Zen mastars... I’ve learned so much from them! I am imagining a house concert at your place with our pets soon after I start working at the zoo! ### Speaker A: I can probably bring out the old guitar for the pets if you'd like, don't even have to wait for when you start. Do you have any free time next week? ### Speaker B: How about Friday?! If that works for you.... it’ll be a blast woof woof! ### Speaker A: Do you think my pet raccoon and your dogs should have a play date? ### Speaker B: I think that would be fantastic! I want them to meet! ### Speaker A: I bet they would have so much fun together.  I wonder if my raccoon would be afraid of your dogs though?  We would have to keep everybody on a leash until we see that they get along. ### Speaker B: Oh maybe! My terriers are quite elderly so theyre very mellow if that helps ### Speaker A: Yes, being older dogs will be much better.  I know some of those younger terriers can have quite a lot of energy.  How goes the job hunt? Have you had any offers yet? ### Speaker B: It's going okay. I'm not really in a rush because I'm planning on leaving my part-time and having a small break between starting a new one ### Speaker A: I would love to take some time off.  I've been working at my job for almost 10 years now, and I've only taken 3 vacations in that whole time.  Do you think you'll take a cruise if you take some time off?' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself! ### \n\n``` Speaker A Input:\nRecent Dialogs: Speaker A: I went out and got a pizza, and when I got home Journey ate a whole piece by herself! ### \n\n``` Speaker A Input:",
