I want some suggestion from you.\nPlum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them\nIN MY HOME?! A TREE? That was not at all what I was thinking. Do they grow well indoors? I am intrigued. \nWell if you want to make it like a proper garden experience then I would suggest going all in, and go for the best most authentic looking items you could get \nWow! Ok! This is sounding like a bigger undertaking! Should I embrace bugs in the home if they help the plants or am I getting wild?\nWell from my experince bugs do the complete opposite and don't help at all, so avoid that at all costs! Fertilizers are the way to go to help with growth.\nOh man. I have lots to learn. What is the lifespan of a plum tree?\naround 10 to 15 years but if you take care of them I'm sure you could get 20 out of it.\nNow we are also talking commitment! This is not how I expected my day to go! I am excited, yet so nervous! \nIt doesn't take too much time to do per day so after school give it a little water and that should keep them in great way. Speaking off school how are you getting on?\nOk! I am putting my fate in your hands on this one. School is fine. I don't really pay attention to anything except band class.\n\n[MEMORY]\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Gardening and Survival in Space', 'Related Summaries': 'Discussion on gardening, plant survival in space, and the possibility of using weeds for space travel.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: What plants do you think would be able to survive a space trip best? ### Speaker B: Hmmm, maybe the weeds growing in my backyard, haha.

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around gardening and seeking advice on maintaining a home garden, particularly concerning plum trees. The MEMORY mainly discusses gardening in space, which is not relevant or helpful to the current conversation about home gardening. The topic of plant survival in space and weeds does not have a direct connection to the context provided.\n\nJudgement: No"
