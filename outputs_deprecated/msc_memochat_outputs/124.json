Maybe put it on at bedtime so if you pass out it would be ok. How many years of Karate have you done? ### Speaker B: I've been doing Karate for a little over one year.  I wish I could be more consistent about it.  Sometimes it's hard to get to the classes.  I have so many other activities that keep from getting into class every week.
