I love camping out and they have such cool food there and all kinds of drinks. Love to sleep over and wake up to some great music. Yes, it's the alternator, but, don't worry, I'll get you a good price and repair it.  ### Speaker A: I always over do it with the food and drink when I go. It is worth it though when you can just wake up and go straight to the stage to watch some live music.  ### Speaker B: Yes, I miss that. I'll ask my wife if she's up to going. Since she's pregnant, I let her make the rules. ### Speaker A: Ah you might have to give the festivals a miss for a few years. I can not imagine camping with a small baby! ### Speaker B: Ha! Yes. But, she's still got another trimester to go, so she may want to go just for the day. But, yeah, I wouldn't go camping with a small baby either. ### Speaker A: You might have to go soon then and like you say just go along for the day. Your wife would probably get quite tired with all the walking and standing though. ### Speaker B: We have one that is local and I think we'll try that. And, I'll let her just sit by the stage while I get all the food and run around.  ### Speaker A: So tell me, did you and your wife end up going to your local festival? ### Speaker B: We were on the way out the door and unfortunately she suddenly had really bad morning sickness so we had to pulll out, such a bummer!  ### Speaker A: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that! Is she feeling any better? There will be other events, as long as she is ok.  ### Speaker B: It's true! Obviously her and the baby are the main priority, so I was okay with it. And not really, she's sort of been sick since then unfortunately. Have you gone to a concert yet this week? Might have to live vicariously through your music-going for the time being haha' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker B: About that Bluegrass show -- A friend of mine mentioned that he has a cabin he won't be using only about 20 minutes away.
