    "raw_prediction": "It's great to hear that you're focused on getting internships and making connections in your field. As for my knees, they started causing pain due to wear and tear from my time as a physician assistant. It's nice to relax at the beach now and find some relief in the ocean water.",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves a discussion about internships in the medical field and personal activities such as going to the beach. The MEMORY contains information about networking and connections in sports medicine and general challenges in finding internships. Although the MEMORY mentions networking and connections, it is related to sports and doesn't specifically address the medical field or relate to knee pain, which is the specific topic of interest in the latter part of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nJudgement: No"
