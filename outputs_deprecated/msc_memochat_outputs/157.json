    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a lovely way to spend time with your family. I haven't been to Italy yet, but watching Luca made me want to visit too! It's great to have those moments of relaxation amidst busy schedules.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY provides past dialogues about Disney movies, specifically mentioning \"Luca\" and \"Miracle,\" which are relevant to the current dialogue about recent movie watching experiences. Although the focus of the MEMORY is on the movies and not on travel experiences, it can still provide context regarding the common interest in Disney movies and having busy schedules, which align with the current dialogue context.\nJudgement: Yes"
