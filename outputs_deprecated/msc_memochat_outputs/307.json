    "raw_prediction": "It's great that you are planning to make a garden! Have you considered including some weeds in your garden as well? According to our previous discussion, weeds might be ideal for space travel due to their ability to survive in harsh conditions with minimal resources.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is focused on home gardening suggestions, particularly about plum and pair trees. However, the MEMORY contains a discussion about gardening in space, which is not pertinent to making a garden at home or the specific tree suggestions given. Hence, it does not provide past information that can assist in generating a relevant and proper next response.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
