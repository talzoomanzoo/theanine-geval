I have never understood how some people don't think they're cute. ### Speaker B: They are great little pets. But I did leave them out of the painting. Just the 5 dogs since the rats don't stay still. ### Speaker A: That does make a lot of sense. I can't imagine the dogs were too cooperative either. Are they all the same breed or do you have a big mix? ### Speaker B: I have a grant Dane, two German shepherds, pit bull, and a mixed we are not sure what he is. ### Speaker A: Tell me more about your dogs.

Kittens are so cute but it is a lot of work, Have you decided on the breed yet? ### Speaker A: As much as I think certain breeds of cats are really smart or pretty, I think I'm just going to see what they have at the shelter.
