    "raw_prediction": "It's important to avoid feeding wild animals like raccoons, as it can lead to dependency and potentially dangerous interactions. Installing barriers like aluminum sheeting is a safer and more effective way to manage animal intruders in the long run.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The past information in the MEMORY discusses strategies for handling raccoons, like using aluminum sheeting and locks for garbage. This aligns with the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Speaker A mentions using aluminum sheeting for raccoon issues. The MEMORY reinforces the notion of raccoons being smart and difficult to handle, which is relevant to the context.\nJudgement: Yes"
