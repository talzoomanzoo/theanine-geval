Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nYeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nNo, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nWell, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nOh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\nPeople can get to a point where they don't need me at all, for some it can be as quick as 4 or 5 sessions but some people feel they need to stay in therapy for years and years, it completely depends on the patient! \nWow, that gives me a completely different perspective. You'd really be ok with seeing me? You don't think it would be a conflict of interest since we're friends?\nNo not at all but if you didn't feel comfortable talking to me I can recommend a couple of my colleagues who are just as brilliant\nI'd prefer to see you since I'm already comfortable talking to you! It will get the awkward part out of the way for me!\n\n[MEMORY]\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'experience in practice', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker B talks about their training and experience in their therapy practice.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: I had to train for a while with other people before I was fully certified and licensed, but I've now been working in my own practice for about six years.

    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: In this dialogue context, the main focus is on the personal relationship between Speaker A and Speaker B and the potential for Speaker B to provide therapeutic services. While the memory provides information about Speaker B's experience in therapy practice, the current context does not directly require details about such experience. The dialogue is more about the interpersonal dynamic and the comfort level of Speaker A seeking therapy from Speaker B rather than specifics of Speaker B's professional training or past experience.\n\nJudgement: N/A"
