Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too?\nWell fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also?\nSid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways?\nThey've been better as I left my previous job so I'm spending more time with them, how do you manage to work full time and still keep those animals happy?\nI think working at the zoo so long has helped. Why did you leave your last job. Was that the one you were working in the warehouse? Sorry to hear about your dogs, it can be hard managing older animals.\nYea, that totally makes sense! I just wanted time off to spend with the dogs and look for a better job elsewhere, I'm hoping that I'll be able to get a job outside of a warehouse!\nThat is understandable. I didn't always think I would end up a zookeeper.

Based on the previous conversations, you can continue by asking Speaker B about their future plans or aspirations after leaving the warehouse job. This could lead to a deeper conversation about their career goals or potential job opportunities outside of the warehouse setting.",
