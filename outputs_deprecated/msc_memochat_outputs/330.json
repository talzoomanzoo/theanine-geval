It's just a ribbon and $25 gift certificate, but I'm excited that I can add this to my CV/resume.\nWow, that's amazing! Congratulations! Yes, prize amount aside, that's still an amazing accomplishment. \nYea, I'm upset that I didn't get 1st Place but 3rd Place is still good! Do you plan on trying origami soon?\nYes, I'd love for you to teach me when we have a little more time to get together. I'm impressed by people who can just take a piece of paper or cloth and turn it into a masterpiece just by folding it. I've heard people say it's easier than it looks and I've heard people say it's harder than it looks. What do you think?\nIt depends on what you are trying to make out of origami, you can make some super complicated stuff, there's actually special paper that you can get for it! You may have seen origami be used in the hospital for some breathing aperatus!\nThat's amazing. I had no idea, but that totally makes sense. Do you have to practice a lot -- sort of a use it or lose it kind of thing?\nYea, I think for the more complicated origami it's kind of a use it or lose it but for the simple stuff you can usually take a couple months of and still remember to do it!

    "raw_prediction": "No, I didn't see origami in Japan, but I did learn that there's special paper for origami and it's used in hospitals for breathing apparatus. It seems like for more complicated origami, it's a \"use it or lose it\" situation, but for simpler designs, you can take a break and still remember how to do it after a couple of months.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is focused on origami and includes a question about seeing origami in Japan. The MEMORY contains a conversation where one speaker mentions visiting Japan but not specifically about seeing origami there, which is the current topic. Thus, the MEMORY doesn't offer relevant past information needed to generate a proper response for the current context.\nJudgement: No"
