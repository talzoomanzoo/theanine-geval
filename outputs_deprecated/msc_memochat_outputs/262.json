I wish my teacher was better, or at least made the topic interesting.  It's so boring in his class that I have a hard time paying attention. ### Speaker B: It is for my sport medicine. It is the last one of the class I have made A's all year so hopefully I can pass this one also and I'll be done. ### Speaker A: Oh nice!  I wish that I could get all A's.  I'm more of a B and occasional C student.  The only guaranteed A I have is in gym, haha ### Speaker B: I think everyone gets an A in gym. I have studied really hard to get those As I want to pass with good grades. I figure it would help me get a good job afterwards. ### Speaker A: I'm sure it will.  My sister got good grades in school and ended up with a great teaching job.  I know it's not the same, but it definitely helped her.  I still am hoping that I can get a soccer scholarship, because there's no way that I'll get one for my academics. ### Speaker B: Just keep at it and try your hardest.
