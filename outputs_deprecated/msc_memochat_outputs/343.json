Thank you for the recommendation.\nOf course. I recommend that movie to everyone I meet. I think I've watched it over one hundred times. So what is the next movie on your list to watch soon?\nYeah it was great and I will also recommend to people when they ask what movie is good. So next is another one you recommended which is coming to America. What’s the next movie your going to watch? \nThere is a horror genre movie that was released just this week which I'm going to watch tonight. It is called \"Girl Next.\"\nOh that sounds interesting, I will look into that and put it on my list. How has your job been going? Is there where you get all these great ideas for what to watch?  \nMy Film Studies professor job has been going absolutely great lately. I love all my students, because they really get into the lectures and ask lots of questions. Yes, my job requires me to watch movies all the time, so that is how I find the best ones. Is your programmer job going all right lately?\nThat sounds amazing. Super lucky to have students that really enjoy what they are learning about and I’m sure that’s down to the way you teach and what you teach them. I’m so glad it is all going well for you. Yeah it is going much better now, I’m really getting in the swing of things thank you for asking. \nYou're welcome. So, returning to the subject of Pulp Fiction, did you think it was funny? Did you think it was too violent for kids to watch?\nYeah there was some funny parts in that movie. I kinda think it may be a little to violent for kids, but I would just allow it to each parent to decide I would probably let my grandkids watch.

    "raw_prediction": "I believe that when it comes to deciding if a movie is too violent for kids, it ultimately depends on the parent's discretion. Personally, I think some parts of Pulp Fiction could be too intense for younger audiences. It's always best to consider the individual child and their maturity level before allowing them to watch such movies. What are your thoughts on this matter?",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The Dialogue Context revolves around discussions on movies, particularly on opinions regarding \"Pulp Fiction\", and mentions previous movie recommendations. The MEMORY contains relevant past conversations that can assist in continuing this movie-related discussion, especially in the context of recommendations and appreciation for \"Pulp Fiction\".\nJudgement: Yes"
