My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to?\nI recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca.

I would love to visit Italy some day though if we get the chance. Have you ever been to Italy before?\nI have never gone to Italy because I'm always so busy. If I ever go, I would want to spend a month there, but work has been hectic lately. Would your kids go with you if you went to Italy?\nAbsolutely!

What are you most excited about doing when you get there?\nI'm extremely excited about the sunset tour. Each day is at a new location to watch the sunset. It's suppose to be romantic, but I am just going alone, so I see it as more calming than anything.\n\n[MEMORY]\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Upcoming Trip', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A shares about an upcoming trip to Hawaii and plans to share photos with Speaker B's kids.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: I just got confirmation on a \"Hawaii Sunset\" tour I booked for next month!  ### Speaker B: That sounds right up your alley!
