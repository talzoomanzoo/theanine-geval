    "raw_prediction": "That's exciting that you're interested in continuing to work in the lab! It's important to prioritize your classes though. Keeping in touch with the lab is a great idea. As for the hamburger from a cloned cow, I think it's an interesting topic to consider!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY contains information about the lab work and future plans for cloning a cow, which is directly relevant to the current conversation about continuing lab work when the cow is cloned. There is also information about the speaker's school plans, which correlates with the statement about potentially quitting if classes are too hard.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
