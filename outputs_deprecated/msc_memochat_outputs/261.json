Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\nI have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\nThe process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\nOh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.\nThat sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe?\nThere is some weird chemical mix that I really do not mess with.  It is easy to clean up.  I try to stay away from this part of the movies.  I know what it should look like and that we want to keep everyone safe when using the fake blood.\nChemicals!  Do the actors hate working with it then?  I can imagine they are a pretty high maintenance bunch.  Do they worry about the blood messing with their looks?\nOur actors are pretty amateur.  No big name ones so they are really good to work with.  Hey, how about you?  How is your interview practice going?  I am pretty sure you be excellent during it!\nI think this discussion is helping me with making small talk, so thanks.  I just have to try and remember who i am and try to sell my good points.\nThat is a good approach.  I suppose you have been doing research on the company you are interviewing with?  I find it always helps to know the company as best you can for an interview.\nYes. Thanks for the reminder.  I have a couple of more companies to research today.  Of course, it is always interesting to figure out what a company's corporate culture is.\n\n[MEMORY]\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Horror Movie Discussions', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B talk about horror movies, including preferences and recent releases.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: For sure.
