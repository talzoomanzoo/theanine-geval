How are the little furries doing?\nThey are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from?\nSomeone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there.\nThat's great. I have gotten my pets from the shelter and they seem happy I brought them home. I have a hard time saying no to them which is why I have so many pets. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs. Do you have a name in mind for your cat? \nI've thought of a lot of  names, but in the end it will probably depend on the breed and the sex.  \nThat's true. Is pilates hard? I've always wanted to try it but I don't know if it will be too difficult.\nNo, I don't think it's hard.  I actually enjoy it.  It's more fun than work, at least to me. You should give it a try!\nMaybe I will. Do you think I can start at home by watching Youtube videos, or do I need to go to a Pilates class?\nYou can probably start with Youtube just to see if you like it.  Much better to go to a class I think though.  Of course, I'm biased. I'm in love with my instructor! haha\nLol, okay I will definitely try it at home first. If I can get the hang of it, I will sign up for a class. Hopefully I can get an instructor as good as yours lol! \nWell, getting some individual responses to questions and individual attention at times, I think makes a difference. But there is nothing wrong with going to youtube first!  I did!\n\n[MEMORY]\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Pets and Painting', 'Related Summaries': 'Conversation about pets, painting pets, and their personalities.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: You deserve it.

I have never understood how some people don't think they're cute. ### Speaker B: They are great little pets. But I did leave them out of the painting. Just the 5 dogs since the rats don't stay still. ### Speaker A: That does make a lot of sense. I can't imagine the dogs were too cooperative either. Are they all the same breed or do you have a big mix? ### Speaker B: I have a grant Dane, two German shepherds, pit bull, and a mixed we are not sure what he is. ### Speaker A: Tell me more about your dogs.

I'm really excited.  ### Speaker B: Rats are smart. That's cool. Kittens are so cute but it is a lot of work, Have you decided on the breed yet? ### Speaker A: As much as I think certain breeds of cats are really smart or pretty, I think I'm just going to see what they have at the shelter.

The MEMORY includes past conversations about pets, painting, dog preferences, pet care, and getting kittens, which could provide additional context or enrich the conversation about pets. However, the latter part about Pilates starting at home doesn't directly relate to MEMORY.
