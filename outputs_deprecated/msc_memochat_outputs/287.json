He's an avid cook but sometimes that makes the cooking process a lot longer than I want! ### Speaker A: I would recommend a pressure cooker. It is a great item for beginner cooks.

    "raw_prediction": "Shrimp fried rice typically does contain eggs, so it sounds like a perfect starting point for you since you have your own eggs! It's a simple recipe with not a lot of ingredients, so I think you'll enjoy making it. Let me know how it turns out!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is primarily about discussing recipes, specifically shrimp fried rice, and using eggs because the speaker grows their own eggs. The past MEMORY includes information related to pressure cookers and cooking tips, which is relevant but not directly needed for the current dialogue about shrimp fried rice and eggs. The context doesn't require detailed past information about pressure cookers to generate a response about a specific recipe question.\n\nJudgement: No"
