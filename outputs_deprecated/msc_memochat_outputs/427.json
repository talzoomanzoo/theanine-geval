    "raw_prediction": "No, I won't be taking my pet snakes with me to my college dorm. As much as I love them, it's important to ensure their safety and well-being, and a college dorm may not provide the ideal environment for them. Plus, it's always good to respect any rules or regulations that the college may have regarding pets.",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The dialogue context is about the speaker discussing their pet snakes and whether they will take them to college. The memory includes information about the names of the snakes, which could be useful in making the conversation more personalized or comprehensive. However, the memory does not contain specific information relevant to the last question about taking the snakes to college, as it mainly focuses on scuba diving and little about the current topic of discussion.\nJudgement: No"
