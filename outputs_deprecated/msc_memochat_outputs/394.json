I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. \nI hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me.\nOhhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house. \nUnderstandable. Have you ever tried contacting animal control? That's how I got Bandicoot. I was working that day and animal control came by explaining about needing fosters for raccoons. I thought it was weird, so I did it and began to work at the small raccoon cafe that is part of the zoo. I love it. \nThat is a good idea.  Maybe they could help move them to a safer area.  I have a lot of traffic around and they could get hit if they are coming to my place all the time.  Have you been able to teach your raccoon any tricks?\n\n[MEMORY]\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Fostering Animals and Raccoon Encounter', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A discusses fostering animals and dealing with raccoons while Speaker B shares experiences with Bandicoot the raccoon.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: One of my foster dogs is going to her forever home tomorrow, I'm excited for her but will be sad to see her go at the same time! ### Speaker B: I understand, it must be tough to give away a dog you have fostered for such a long time.

    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context focuses on dealing with raccoons and the mention of Bandicoot, a raccoon that Speaker B works with. While the MEMORY contains details of fostering animals, including Bandicoot, it doesn't provide information relevant to teaching Bandicoot tricks, which is what the dialogue context ends with. Therefore, MEMORY doesn't contain helpful information for the model to generate a response specific to the question about teaching tricks.\n\nJudgement: No"
