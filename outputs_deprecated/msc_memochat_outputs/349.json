    "raw_prediction": "That's great that you are teaching your kids your grandmother's jello recipe! It's wonderful to pass on family traditions. It's understandable to want to cut back on sugary desserts for health reasons. Watching baking how-to videos is a great way to learn new skills in the kitchen. It's surprising to see how much sugar is in desserts, but there are always ways to make healthier versions or enjoy them in moderation. Good luck with your baking endeavors!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context revolves around teaching kids a jello recipe and the importance of family traditions. The memory provides additional context about learning jello recipes from a grandmother and it being a family tradition, which aligns with Speaker B's comments. This shared context about family traditions and jello recipes could be useful for Unknown to generate a response that continues or expands upon this topic of family and shared experiences in cooking.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
