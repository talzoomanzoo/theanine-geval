Have you tried sharing your love of Greek mythology with her?\nHi there, hope you are wlll and managing to save up for your Italy trip?  Thank for asking about the Greek mythology study, we are doing very well. It helps because i am so passionate about it and hope to get to the Greek islands soon\nYes I have been saving up for another trip to Italy! I can't wait. It's planned for next Spring. Do you have any plans to go back to Italy in the future?\nI would love to get back to Italy but need to save up and the hopeful priority is to Greece this year.  You have friends in Europe are you in contact to see what plans you can make?\nYes I've been talking to them quite a bit so they know what's going on. I'll be staying with some of them while I'm over there. I have never been to Greece....I'd like to go though. Maybe I'll add it to my itinerary! Maybe we could plan to be in Greece at the same time?!\nThat would be so good.  There is so much history and the roman statues i take my daughter to see in the museums and through our local resources is fab.  She is building up the passion which is lovely to see.  Have you still got your hair blue or has it grown out now?\nThat's awesome! Maybe you can teach me a little about all the mythology. I think I've never liked it before only because I didn't understand it. My hair is back to being its natural brown - lol I'm being boring for the moment.\nNever boring you will keep styling it all sorts of interesting styles im sure.  Yes i would be lovely to be your guide for the day out in Greece.  Bring some decent walking boots and some sun cream, its a different heat out there but your tan is probably topped up with going to the beach each day.\nThat's good advice! Thank you! I saw on the news Cali has been getting a lot of rain. Have you still been able to run on the beach each day?\n\n[MEMORY]\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Greek Mythology', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B talk about Greek mythology, specifically Poseidon and historical interest', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: Oh that's awesome.

    "raw_prediction": "It seems like you and Speaker B have been discussing travel plans and your interest in Greek mythology. Perhaps you can continue the conversation by asking Speaker B about their experiences with Greek mythology and if they have any favorite myths or gods they can share with you.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context involves a discussion about Greek mythology and traveling to Greece, which potentially ties in with Speaker A's past disinterest in mythology as mentioned in the memory. The memory contains Speaker A's perspective on Greek mythology and could help form responses related to any references to their previous statements about mythology. However, the immediate next response seems to be about the weather in California and potential rain, which the memory does not aid in responding to, as it contains no relevant information about weather or California's conditions.\n\nJudgement: No"
