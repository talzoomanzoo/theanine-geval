    "raw_prediction": "I believe that vegetables like dark leafy greens, broccoli, and bell peppers are great for healing due to their nutrient content. It's best to avoid vegetables with high levels of pesticides or those that you may have a sensitivity to.",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The dialogue context involves a discussion about movies, food, and the healing properties of food. The MEMORY contains information on healing practices, which aligns with the current direction of the conversation about healing foods. However, the specific details about vegetables for healing are not present in the MEMORY, even though the related topic is discussed. This indicates a connection but not direct information needed for the next response specifically about vegetables.\n\nJudgement: No"
