    "raw_prediction": "You could consider getting patio furniture that complements the green and purple in your living room. Maybe look for furniture with neutral colors like white or gray to balance out the bold colors. As for where I got my patio furniture, I found mine at a local home goods store. You might want to check out different stores to see what fits your style and budget.",
