Today was a good day since I got to play with my son's kids. You? ### Speaker A: I love kid too, but I dont have much time with them am a librarian. ### Speaker B: That is interesting. My mother also had the same profession as you. ### Speaker A: Thats cool I have 3 children does your mother has the same thing? ### Speaker B: No but I had a lot of kids.. ### Speaker A: Are they up to nine my is below the age of nine. ### Speaker B: They are all grown up now and have kids of their own. ### Speaker A: Really, how do they go to work everyday is it by boat like me? ### Speaker B: Most of them take the subway. What do you do? ### Speaker A: I love playing flute but that is not what I do for living. ### Speaker B: Do you play in a band or symphony? ### Speaker A: Get to spend more time with your son and grandkids? ### Speaker B: I did it was a great time, we went to the park! ### Speaker A: That is always a great way to spend time with kids. ### Speaker B: Most definitely, for sure the moments I cherish in life. Have  you got to spend time with your kids? ### Speaker A: Work has kept me away from them more than I would like, unfortunately.  ### Speaker B: That is unfortunate but I know how that goes. My mom was a libraian, so she was always busy helping people ### Speaker A: It is a taxing job, but very rewarding. ### Speaker B: Most definitely, I think the rewards ulitmately make it worth it, plus your kids can get any book they want! ### Speaker A: That is a huge perk! Kids don't read enough these days.  ### Speaker B: I know! I feel like most kids would struggle even finding a book in a library, internet has made it easy for them! ### Speaker A: No kidding. Things sure have changed over the years. ### Speaker B: I know! I can't remember the last time my grandkids asked to go to the libary. ### Speaker A: Have you ever thought about taking your grandkids to a library and explaining what your mom did for a living as a librarian? It could be a great learning field trip for them.  ### Speaker B: Kids just don't seem to be interested in going to the library anymore. ### Speaker A: I agree, I see libraries closing more and more. Even school libraries are half the size they use to be. ### Speaker B: I'm not really sure of a solution to keep libraries open. With the rise of the internet people do not need them as much as I used to. ### Speaker A: That is basically it. Everything is becoming electronic. Paper books are not really needed, only people who cherish a real book keep them relevant. ### Speaker B: I do find it interesting that libraries now are finding creative ways to still stay relevant like creating little maker spaces.  Some are adding 3D printers and other tools to keep kids learning and entertained in a safe environment ### Speaker A: Yes we implement those in our library. We still get parents bringing in their little kids which I find encouraging ### Speaker B: Not only will the kids learn but the parents will also learn new skills to ### Speaker A: even librarians like me learn new skills too, lol ### Speaker B: That's true you're never too old to learn a new skill ### Speaker A: :), so how was the trip to the park with your grandkids? ### Speaker B: It was great the weather was really nice and I really enjoyed getting outside and getting some fresh air ### Speaker A: My youngest child just asked me if I could teach them how to play the flute! ### Speaker B: Oh really? So they want to play the flute like you. That's wonderful to hear. Are you planning to teach them yourself or hire a teacher? ### Speaker A: I am going to teach them myself. I am just so proud that they came to me and asked for my help. It was nice to feel wanted by my kids.  ### Speaker B: I bet is a wonderful feeling. I took my grandkids fishing once because they asked me to. It's a great way to bond with them. Now you and your youngest can bond through music. I think that's wonderful. ### Speaker A: Yes, I am so glad we can spend some time together and bond over flutes. She wants to learn because of the singer Lizzo. She can play the flute so well that it inspired her. Have you heard of her? ### Speaker B: Ah no I have not. I'm sure one of my grandkids have. Are they very famous? I'm a bit out of touch with music these days. ### Speaker A: Yes she is famous. Me too. I am a bit out of touch too with the latest music. My daughter played the video of her playing the flute and singing. It was incredible. I am glad she found a motivation though. Can any of your kids play an instrument? ### Speaker B: No not my kids or grandkids. They spend so much time on their phones and tablets that they rarely take interest in such things. It would be wonderful if one of them did take an interest in music. Is your youngest the only one interested in musical intrustments right now? ### Speaker A: Yes at the moment. My other two are just like yours - addicted to tablets and phones. I hoping that when I start teaching my youngest the flute the others would want to join in. I will grab a few spare just in case. Did you ever take your kids fishing? Did they like it? ### Speaker B: They sure did. Even though the oldest girl was so busy with her texting and what not. The other grandkids loved it and even caught a good sized fish! I really hope they'll let me take them again one day.' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids? ###Speaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call! ### \n\n``` Speaker B Input:\nRecent Dialogs: Speaker A: Do you use technology like text messaging to interact with your grandkids? ###Speaker B: No I can't get my head round it, I much rather a good ol fashioned phone call! ### \n\n``` Speaker B Input:",

    "raw_prediction": "That's totally understandable. Sometimes simpler forms of communication like a phone call can feel more personal and meaningful. It's great that you prioritize that kind of interaction with your grandkids!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\n\nBrief explanation: The memory contains information about Speaker B's interactions with their grandkids, such as taking them to the park and fishing, as well as their general preference for non-technological means of communication. This is relevant to the dialogue context, where Speaker B expresses a preference for traditional phone calls over text messaging to communicate with their grandkids.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
