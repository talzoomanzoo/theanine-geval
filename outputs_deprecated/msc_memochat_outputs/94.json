How are the little furries doing?\nThey are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from?\nSomeone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there.\nThat's great. I have gotten my pets from the shelter and they seem happy I brought them home. I have a hard time saying no to them which is why I have so many pets. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs. Do you have a name in mind for your cat? \nI've thought of a lot of  names, but in the end it will probably depend on the breed and the sex.  \nThat's true. Is pilates hard? I've always wanted to try it but I don't know if it will be too difficult.\nNo, I don't think it's hard.  I actually enjoy it.  It's more fun than work, at least to me. You should give it a try!\n\n[MEMORY]\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Pets and Painting', 'Related Summaries': 'Conversation about pets, painting pets, and their personalities.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: You deserve it.
