    "raw_prediction": "Movie blood can be made from a variety of ingredients, but a common recipe includes corn syrup, red food coloring, and a thickening agent like flour or cornstarch. Some recipes also include chocolate syrup for a more realistic texture. It's important to make sure the blood is safe to use on set and easy to clean up afterwards. Do you have a favorite blood recipe for your horror movies?",
