    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves discussing the Black Widow movie and asks about the types of foods eaten during the movie. The MEMORY talks about family movie night and a brother spending time on a houseboat, which is not directly relevant to the current conversationâ€™s focus on movie details or Brazilian foods. Therefore, it does not directly contribute helpful past information for generating a response.\nJudgement: \"No\""
