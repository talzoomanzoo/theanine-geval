It's actually a foreign film so there are subtitles. What belt are you in Karate?  ### Speaker B: I'm a green belt.  Hmmm, subtitles, maybe not my favorite.  You say it's really good?  My significant other likes foreign films, but honestly, I tend to fall asleep during them. ### Speaker A: Yeah a lot of people don't like reading the movies they watch. I get it. Maybe put it on at bedtime so if you pass out it would be ok. How many years of Karate have you done? ### Speaker B: I've been doing Karate for a little over one year.  I wish I could be more consistent about it.  Sometimes it's hard to get to the classes.  I have so many other activities that keep from getting into class every week.  Especially since I'm trying to decide whether to go back to school or not. ### Speaker A: It's always good to go back to school but only if you have time for it. don't add more to your plate with something as important as schooling. What would you go back for?  ### Speaker B: I'm planning on going for a certificate in IT work.  I think it will pay more, and you know, I'm getting older and looking for a job that is a little less demanding physically.

    "raw_prediction": "That's great that you're dedicated to karate! Pursuing IT certification sounds like a smart move for your future plans. I haven't considered taking martial arts classes, but it's always interesting to learn new skills.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The MEMORY contains detailed information about Speaker B's karate experience, which includes the fact that they have been practicing for a little over a year and hold a green belt. This background about Speaker B's dedication and challenges with attending classes could enrich the generation of a nuanced response when engaging in a conversation about martial arts. However, the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is fairly straightforward and does not inherently require past information to respond appropriately. Therefore, past information about specific karate details is not necessary in crafting a relevant response here.\nJudgement: N/A"
