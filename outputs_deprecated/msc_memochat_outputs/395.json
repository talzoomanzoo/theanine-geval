I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. \nI hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me.\nOhhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house. \nUnderstandable. Have you ever tried contacting animal control? That's how I got Bandicoot. I was working that day and animal control came by explaining about needing fosters for raccoons. I thought it was weird, so I did it and began to work at the small raccoon cafe that is part of the zoo. I love it. \nThat is a good idea.  Maybe they could help move them to a safer area.  I have a lot of traffic around and they could get hit if they are coming to my place all the time.  Have you been able to teach your raccoon any tricks?\nThe only trick I was able to teach him, that I deeply regret, was how locks worked. I thought it was cool at first, you know, to see a raccoon unlock a door. And now, I regret it so much. I've had to change the layout of my apartment and put deadbolts on my doors so that Bandicoot can't get out. And, he is sneaky about it. One time, he unlocked the pantry and was eating some cookies! It's like having a toddler that never grows up.\n\n[MEMORY]\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Fostering Animals and Raccoon Encounter', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A discusses fostering animals and dealing with raccoons while Speaker B shares experiences with Bandicoot the raccoon.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: One of my foster dogs is going to her forever home tomorrow, I'm excited for her but will be sad to see her go at the same time! ### Speaker B: I understand, it must be tough to give away a dog you have fostered for such a long time.

    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context discusses dealing with raccoons and garbage, fostering raccoons, and Speaker B's experiences with Bandicoot the raccoon. The memory contains relevant information on both fostering animals, including raccoons, and dealing with raccoons intruding into garbage. This information aligns well with the current dialogue context, potentially aiding Speaker B to generate a response based on their previous experiences and insights into raccoon behavior and control.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
