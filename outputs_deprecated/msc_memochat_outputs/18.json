It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nThat sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nI can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nI would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nYeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nNo, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\nI will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car?\nYes, there are several.

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY contains evidence of Speaker A having previously offered to teach Speaker B both swimming and programming. This past information is relevant as Speaker B mentions wanting to learn to swim and hopes to be taught programming. Thus, the MEMORY contains useful information to acknowledge and build upon in the dialogue.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
