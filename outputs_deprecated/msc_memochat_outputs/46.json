    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I still enjoy being a therapist. It can be challenging at times to listen and respond appropriately, but my training and experience have helped me in developing those skills over the years.",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The dialogue context is asking whether the therapist still enjoys their job and expressing concern over the difficulty of listening and offering the right advice. The MEMORY contains information about Speaker B's training, experience, and duration of practice, which could be relevant to explaining their enjoyment and ability to handle the challenges of the job.\nJudgement: Yes"
