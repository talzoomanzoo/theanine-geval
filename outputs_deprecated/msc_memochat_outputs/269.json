    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses on discussing exams and an upcoming English final. The information in MEMORY, particularly about Speaker A's history exam experience and their wish for better teacher support, does not provide any additional context or specific details relevant to preparing for the English exam. While both contexts share a general topic of exams, MEMORY does not offer specific past information that would assist in generating a more appropriate response about helping with English studies in the current dialogue.\nJudgement: No"
