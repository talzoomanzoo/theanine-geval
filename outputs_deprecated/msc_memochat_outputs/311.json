    "raw_prediction": "It seems like you are discussing gardening and plant care. Remember, fertilizers can be beneficial for plant growth, and avoiding bugs is usually a good idea. If you have any specific questions or need more advice, feel free to ask!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context focuses on indoor gardening and suggests avoiding bugs and using fertilizers. The memory, however, talks about the survival of plants in space and mentions that weeds might survive a space trip. This memory is not relevant to the ongoing discussion about planting trees indoors and managing bugs and fertilizers. The context does not require information about plants in space for response generation.\nJudgement: \"No\""
