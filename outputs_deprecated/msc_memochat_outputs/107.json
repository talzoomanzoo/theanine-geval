I'll keep working on a teleport machine. For now, you'll have to get there with more traditional means. So, airplane it is? Have you ever been on a flight before. ### Speaker B: I have been on it a couple times.  My mother said it was powered by pixie dust and I believed her for the longest time!  I am not too scared to go this time.  Have you invented any flying things? ### Speaker A: Squirrels! When I was a kid bouncing on a trampoline, a squirrel jumped down from the tree it was on and landed on the trampoline. Due to my super energetic jumping, he flew for a moment! I guess that's not really an \"invention\" though. Do you ever invent things with your programming experience? ### Speaker B: LOL!  You had me going there for a minute.  I could just see that sucker flying in my mind.  \"Hey Bullwinkle, where's Rocky....\"  LOL  Good one!  I am really good at coding and automating systems, but I haven't really made my own thing. ### Speaker A: I see. I forgot about Rocky and Bullwinkle. That used to be my favorite cartoon. I even watched the live action movies. Thanks for the throwback! I think you just teleported me to my childhood bedroom. I appreciate the free ride down memory lane! I wish I could pay you back with a free plane ticket. ### Speaker B: It's ok!  You gave me the biggest laugh today so I think we are even!  Not to say a free plane ticket wouldn't be nice, but you might just set me on a trampoline and send me flying too! ### Speaker A: That I can do! I'm not sure the squirrel would recommend that method of transportation though, but as long as you sign some liability paperwork before hand, I am good to go! ### Speaker B: Wheeee!  I'm just being so silly now.  Who needs a therapist when we can keep each other so happy? ### Speaker A: What is on your itinerary for your Alaskan vacation? ### Speaker B: Oh, I haven't really looked into that much yet, I guess I should get on that!  Any suggestions?   ### Speaker A: There is so many fun things to do if you enjoy the outdoors! I have heard the fishing and hiking is second to none in Alaska.  ### Speaker B: I'm not big on fishing, but I bet the hiking would be beautiful!  ### Speaker A: I am sure you could even get a hiking tour guide. May help you stay safe from bears or other dangers there. I love a good hike but am often concerned about the bigger animals around.  ### Speaker B: I would definitely go with a tour guide!  I'm not trying to get eaten ha I think it would be cool to see a moose though.   ### Speaker A: Good to hear, that way I know you will be safe! I would love to see a moose in person. I have heard they are larger than you would expect.  ### Speaker B: I can imagine!  I think the biggest animal I've really seen around here in person would be deer or turkey.  Not too exciting ### Speaker A: Well I am excited for this adventure for you! Are you traveling alone or are you going with friends or family? ### Speaker B: I'm traveling alone, but I'm planning on trying to meet up with a friend who lives up there for visit if our schedules work out. ### Speaker A: That would great! I am impressed, I am nervous to travel alone. I prefer having someone around I know when I am on new adventures.  ### Speaker B: I don't mind it.  And sometimes when you want to go somewhere, you just want to go, and it's hard to coordinate with others.  I'm always up for a traveling pal though ### Speaker A: Have you made plans with your friend to get together when you get to Alaska? Does your friend enjoy action movies too?  ### Speaker B: we are working on plans currently. trying to get our schedules lined up. I'm not sure if they like action movies or not.  ### Speaker A: two weeks of the great alaska. have you decided how you spend your time outdoors. ### Speaker B: lots of hiking and trying not to get eaten by mosquitoes. lol ### Speaker A: what else is alaska known for? what can visitors expect besides hiking? ### Speaker B: i'm not sure honestly.
