They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok? \nOkay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish?\nIt's a Chicken parmesan, with a red pepper marinara. It's so crisp and juicy-I love it! They serve it with these sweet roasted asparagus!\nOh that sounds absolutely fabulous. Are you going to get a free dessert, as well?\nYes, I am thinking about trying either the new eclairs, or their tres leches cake with fresh raspberry jam sauce and lemon drizzle! I have too many good options to pick from! What one would you pick?\nHands down, I would pick the tres leches. Ever since I tried it a few years ago, it has always been my favorite dessert.\nOkay, I will try that! I've heard the can be made with different fruits. Did you have fruit with yours?\nI like it best with fresh strawberries. And then it is even better with some fresh whipped cream and chocolate drizzle. Just thinking about it is making me want to have some right now!\nOoh, that sounds delicious! It's a rich and moist cake, so I don't think it should have too much chocolate. I've seen brown sugar and caramel versions too!\n\n[MEMORY]\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Restaurant Perks and Schedule', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A describes restaurant perks, including free meals, and work schedule.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: Haha… I can see it coming!
