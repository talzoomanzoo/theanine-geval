    "raw_prediction": "It's true that the duration of therapy can vary greatly depending on the individual and their needs. Some people may only need a few sessions to achieve their goals, while others may benefit from long-term therapy. It's important to listen to your own needs and work with a therapist who can support you in reaching your desired outcomes.",

The MEMORY contains related information about Speaker B's training and experience in their therapy practice, which could provide contextual background and enhance understanding of the Speaker Bâ€™s responses. However, the context of the conversation is more general and doesn't specifically require this past information for an appropriate response in this instance.\nJudgement: No"
