    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The Memory contains discussions about martial arts and teaching, which aligns with the ongoing conversation about martial arts classes and teaching them. However, the current dialogue context primarily shifts toward the topic of food (take-out from Sufi). Hence, the past conversations regarding martial arts are tangentially related at best.\nJudgement: N/A"
