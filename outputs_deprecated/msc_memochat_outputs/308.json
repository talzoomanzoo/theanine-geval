    "raw_prediction": "It's interesting to consider growing trees indoors, especially if you're looking to create a garden at home. While trees like plum and pear trees may not be the first choice for indoor gardening, there are certain dwarf varieties that can thrive indoors with proper care. Would you like suggestions for indoor plants that are more suitable for home gardening?",
