I was thinking about getting a pair of cats, but I haven't committed yet. How nice fo ryou to have company when you're walking though! What kind of dog do you have?\nCats can be nice! I used to have cats, but am allergic to them and had to give them to my friend. I have an Australian Kelpie who is a rescue.

    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context revolves around a conversation about nature walks and pets. The memory, however, contains irrelevant information about a previous conversation regarding artwork inspiration and listening habits during walks. Therefore, the memory does not contain helpful past information for generating the next response in this context.\nJudgement: No"
