You should give them a call, and ask to adopt one. I am sure they would be happy to give you a kitten, given how well you take care of your cat. ### Speaker B: Oh my goodness that's so exciting! Yes I'll definitely give them a call, at least just to talk about it and see whether one of the kittens would be right for me.
