It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to?\nThe museum has all sorts of galleries.  It has a sculpture garden outside.  I mostly like the impressionist paintings.  I like Van Gogh.  Was your concert outdoors?\nYes. That way they could have a fireworks show too. I love fireworks. Have you ever seen the fireworks at the Disney castle?\nNo, but I have been to Disney World in Florida.  I love fireworks too.  I want to get married on the 4th of July.  That was we will have a national holiday and fireworks for us every year!  It sounds like you've been to Disneyland?\nNo, but I thought you might have since you lived in LA for awhile. Did you get to see any live Disney music performances while you were at Disney World?\nNo, we rode a lot of rides that broke down.  We had to be rescued from the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.  It was stuck.  Someone put on waders and pushed us to the side to climb out.\nOh no! Hopefully your trip to the art museum is much better than that. Did your boyfriend go to Disney World too?\nNo, I had a cousin that I went with.  We stayed in a hotel in Miami too and I got so sunburned on the beach!  I'm sure the art museum will be good if it isn't too crowded.  Was your concert crowded?\nIt was so crowded, but my older brothers went with me and kept me from getting squished. Make sure you wear sunscreen when you visit the beach this time!\n\n[MEMORY]\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Music Taste and Concert Experiences', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B discuss favorite music genres, live music preferences, and experiences attending concerts.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: Wow, I've never had that.
