Did you snag a buck? ### Speaker A: Not this time.  It still went good though.  I checked out the conditions for some of the animals living in the area.  What have you been up to? ### Speaker B: I spent all night playing League of Legends.  But after that I bought Resident Evil VIII.  I haven't turned it on yet but I'm looking forward to it.  Usually I wait for a sale but I couldn't resist. ### Speaker A: That's cool.  What is Resident Evil VIII about?   ### Speaker B: It's a horror game.  You're a guy looking for his kidnapped daughter and you have to explore a bunch of eerie locations full of monsters.  I really liked the last one so I'm eager to see if this one is as good. ### Speaker A: Hmm, that could be interesting.  Do you play by yourself or is it a multiplayer online game? ### Speaker B: I just play it by myself.  I turn the lights out and play it late at night by myself so it's as scary as possible.  Do you like horror movies and scary things like that? ### Speaker A: Not really. About the only thing scary that I like is sneaking up on a deer out in the wild!  I play videogames every now and then but they are usually tame, calm ones. ### Speaker B: I understand.  Where do you go to hunt?  Is it your land or someone you know? ### Speaker A: Both actually. Sometimes I hunt on mine or my family's places and sometimes I go to state hunting sites.  You should go next time I go! ### Speaker B: That would be fun!  I've never shot a real gun before though.  Is it hard? ### Speaker A: Have you enjoyed the game Resident Evil VIII ### Speaker B: Yes I have it's a great game!
