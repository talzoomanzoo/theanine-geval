I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week?\nIt's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day\nThat sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through\nActually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested.\nThat sounds good. I'm looking forward to it. Do you think I will need to rent a car when I'm there, or is it possible to walk and bike in the summer? I always picture huge amounts of snow but I'm not sure if it's like that all year round.\nI would definitely recommend looking for a rental car to have on hand. There is a town within walking distance from me, but it can be dangerous to walk with the wolves and elk around, especially at night.\n\n[MEMORY]\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Visiting Alaska', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker B confirms finding suitable flights to visit Alaska and plans to attend a concert while there.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: Wow, sign me up!
