My family thinks it's dumb of me to buy so many lol but hey it's worth a shot. ### Speaker B: You can't win if you don't play.  I know that for sure.  Hey, I had a really crazy idea and wanted to hear what you thought about it. ### Speaker A: Exactly! Yeah for sure, what's the crazy idea?? I'm very intrigued. ### Speaker B: So you know how when a jackpot is won by multiple people, they split it evenly with each winner?  So if the prize is $100 million and four people get the winning numbers, each person gets 25% of the jackpot?  Well think about this.  If I bought 20 tickets, all with the same numbers, and won the jackpot with three other people, instead of getting 25% of the jackpot, I'd get 20/23rds of the jackpot instead!  So that's what I did! ### Speaker A: LOL but now you only have one chance of winning! I did different numbers for all of my 50 tickets so I have 50 chances. ### Speaker B: Yeah, both strategies have their pros and cons.  But if I win I want it to be on the news.  They'll say, \"There were 23 winners of the jackpot.\"  And then people will think, \"Well that's lame.  Each person takes home such a tiny amount.\"  But then they'll say, \"One insanely brilliant person had 20 winning tickets and is therefore getting the bulk of the jackpot.\"' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: I just bought a new iphone yesterday which is too expensive. ###Speaker B: Oh I see.
