There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you?\nI don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions?\nUnfortunately I mainly play games similar to RE. I don't know why I like them so much. I remember when I was little my brother play Doom and it gave me nightmares for a week. What genre of games you like?\nI like all kinds of games. I like party, fighting, RPGs, shooters, action, adventure, and puzzle games. I enjoy playing Jurassic Park: World but I'd like to find another game to play. The storm means I'll be inside for a bit, so I think I'll curl up with some pizza and just zone out. Do you like to do anything else besides game when it's rainy?\nWell, I might help around the house with cleaning or laundry, but not that much. Mostly gaming. If I feel I sat too long, I'll switch to Nintendo Switch's Ring Fit Adventure to get my body moving a bit. Do yo know that game?\n\n[MEMORY]\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Video Games Comparison', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker B shares details about Resident Evil VIII and discusses gaming preferences with Speaker A.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: That's cool.
