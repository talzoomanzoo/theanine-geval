    "raw_prediction": "That's a valid concern. With proper training and introductions, cats and parrots can coexist peacefully. It's important to supervise their interactions and provide a safe environment for both pets. If you need any tips on introducing them, feel free to ask!",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves discussions about adopting kittens, naming them, and concerns about whether the kittens would get along with a parrot. The MEMORY provides relevant past information about similar concerns from a previous conversation, where Speaker A indicated that their parrot would be fine with more animals, and both speakers discussed strategy for introducing and training the kittens. Therefore, the MEMORY contains helpful past information about the compatibility of cats and the parrot and training ideas.\nJudgement: Yes"
