It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nThat sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nI can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nI would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nYeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nNo, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\nI will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car?\nYes, there are several. Hope we could meet and You possibly teach me about computer programming.\nThat would be great too. I like to program in several different languages. Do you have a preference?\nNo, I'm just getting started so I don't have a preference.
