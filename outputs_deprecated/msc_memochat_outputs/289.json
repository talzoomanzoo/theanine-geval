    "raw_prediction": "Yes, cooking the rice beforehand actually helps to dry it out slightly, resulting in better texture and less stickiness when making fried rice. It's not about aging the rice, but more about the moisture content for a better end result in the dish.",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY provided contains information about pressure cookers and their uses, which is not directly related to the specific question asked in the dialogue context about why it's best to cook rice the day before making fried rice. Therefore, the memory does not contain helpful past information for answering the specific cooking technique question in the dialogue.\nJudgement: No"
