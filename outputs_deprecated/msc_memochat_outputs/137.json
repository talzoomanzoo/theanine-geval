I would love to teach robotics someday.\nThat is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\nWell I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach?\nI would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying.
