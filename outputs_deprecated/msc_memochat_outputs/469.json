Can you tell me about it?\nYes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see. \nI definitely will, this sounds like such an amazing trip. How long has it been since you've been there yourself?\nI was in Greece last two years ago.   I am excited to go again soon!    At somepoint I would like to take a cruise around the islands there.  It seems like a neat way to see all the Islands in an easy way.   Have you ever taken a cruise?\nOnly once before when I was very young, so I don't remember much. It sounds like such a relaxing way to enjoy the day, though. Maybe we can plan a cruise together sometime.\nThat would be fun!  I go to Europe a lot so maybe a cruise in the Caribbean would be nice.  I would like to see Saint Lucia and Saint Thomas.\n\n[MEMORY]\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Sightseeing Plans', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B discuss sightseeing priorities in Rome and Greece.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: I haven't really planned the trip out as it's so last minute!

    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT primarily focuses on the upcoming visit to the Acropolis and the idea of planning a cruise. While the MEMORY has a related topic about sightseeing in Greece and mentions the Acropolis, the context of the current dialogue doesn't require past information from MEMORY to continue discussing the cruise or recent experiences. Therefore, past details from MEMORY aren't necessary for generating a next response.\nJudgement: N/A"
