There was a storm nearby and it was raining for the last three days. Perfect weather for staying in my room playing RE. How about you?\nI don't like playing scary video games but I did play a little bit. The weather was very stormy here as well, so I decided to stay in and mess around to look for something to play. I like everything but scary games but can't decide on what to play next. Do you have any suggestions?\nUnfortunately I mainly play games similar to RE. I don't know why I like them so much. I remember when I was little my brother play Doom and it gave me nightmares for a week. What genre of games you like?\nI like all kinds of games. I like party, fighting, RPGs, shooters, action, adventure, and puzzle games. I enjoy playing Jurassic Park: World but I'd like to find another game to play. The storm means I'll be inside for a bit, so I think I'll curl up with some pizza and just zone out. Do you like to do anything else besides game when it's rainy?\nWell, I might help around the house with cleaning or laundry, but not that much. Mostly gaming. If I feel I sat too long, I'll switch to Nintendo Switch's Ring Fit Adventure to get my body moving a bit. Do yo know that game?\nI've heard of it. I think I need to get some exercise, so that might be a good idea. I'd like to stay in shape as much as I can. I guess games are the best way to do that! That's a good suggestion. How about you? Do you only like games like RE? What other genres do you like?\nI like fighting too, but not RPG types. I tried racing games before, but clearly not good at it so I'm not enjoying them that much. \nMaybe when you get the chance, we should play an online game together. I'm not a competitive person. I mainly play games for fun and I don't care if I win or lose. What do you think?\n\n[MEMORY]\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Video Games Comparison', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker B shares details about Resident Evil VIII and discusses gaming preferences with Speaker A.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: That's cool.

    "prediction": "OUTPUT\n\nBrief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around personal gaming preferences, suggestions for games to try, and discussing activities during rainy weather. While the MEMORY includes similar topics discussed previously, the specific details about Resident Evil VIII and its mode of play (single-player) do not directly contribute to generating a meaningful response in the current context about playing an online game together. The MEMORY information doesn’t add any new insight for the proposed online gaming suggestion or for finding a non-scary game recommendation.\n\nJudgement: No"
