Have you been playing your guitar lately or seen any live bands? ### Speaker A: I try to go to a live event every week if I can. I haven't had time recently to play the guitar as I have been needing to use the bus to get about. Takes a lot longer using the bus than a car. ### Speaker B: Yeah I really don't like public transportation if I can avoid it. I'm happy to help with your car any time. Live music is great. I miss going to festivals. ### Speaker A: Did you find out what was wrong with the car in the end? Festivals are great, even better if you can camp out for a few days there. ### Speaker B: Yeah! I love camping out and they have such cool food there and all kinds of drinks. Love to sleep over and wake up to some great music.
