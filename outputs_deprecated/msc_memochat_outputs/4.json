    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context is primarily focused on travel and book preferences, while the memory contains information about family growth, specifically about a grandchild growing up. There isn't a connection between the two topics that suggests the memory would provide helpful information for generating the next response in the current dialogue.\nJudgement: No"
