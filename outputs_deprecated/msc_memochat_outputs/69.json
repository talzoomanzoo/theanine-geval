    "raw_prediction": "That's great that you're a big fan of Aerosmith! I learned music on my own by practicing and experimenting. It's been a fun journey of self-discovery.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context revolves around personal preferences in music and experiences related to learning and playing instruments. The memory does not contain specific information about Speaker A's learning experience or who taught them music, but rather discusses being in a band and planning concerts. This information is tangentially related but does not directly answer Speaker B's question about Speaker A's music learning experience.\nJudgement: No"
