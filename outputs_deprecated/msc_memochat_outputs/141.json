Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nYes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nIt sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nThat is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\nWell I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach?\nI would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option.\nYes I think history is interesting, too! Both of those subjects would be great because there are probably lots of teaching jobs. What kind of history do you like?\nI love all sorts of history. Right now I am really getting into the weeds of World War II. There's so much to unpack.\nFor sure! So much happened and it really affected how the world is today. I like learning about the history of places where I have lived, it's really interesting.\nThat sounds really cool!
