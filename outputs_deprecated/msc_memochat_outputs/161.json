My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to?\nI recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca. It was super cute and made me want to go visit Italy, but that was too expensive, so instead I booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month. What about you?\nI have been relaxing with the kids as much as I have. My husband has been busy with work, so we haven't had time for anything big. I would love to visit Italy some day though if we get the chance. Have you ever been to Italy before?\nI have never gone to Italy because I'm always so busy. If I ever go, I would want to spend a month there, but work has been hectic lately. Would your kids go with you if you went to Italy?\nAbsolutely! I'd love to travel all over the world with my family to see everything. Hawaii sounds like just as much fun though. What are you most excited about doing when you get there?\nI'm extremely excited about the sunset tour. Each day is at a new location to watch the sunset. It's suppose to be romantic, but I am just going alone, so I see it as more calming than anything.\nI hope you have a lot fun. It sounds like a nice time to get away from everything. You should eat as much of the local Hawaiian food as you can. Have you had Hawaiian food before? I think it's great.\n\n[MEMORY]\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Recent Movies', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B talk about recent movies they have watched.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: Have you seen any new romance movies lately? ### Speaker B: I haven't, my family has been so busy that I have not had a minute to sit and relax.
