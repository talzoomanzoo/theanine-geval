It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nThe history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nA B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nYeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \nExactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on?\nMy last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study?\nAh, English should be easier than History. Sure, I can help you. What do you need to do exactly? Write an essay?\nYeah, we have to write an essay and we have a spelling component towards the end of the exam, I sure could use a little help!\n\n[MEMORY]\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Studying and Exams', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A and Speaker B talk about their studies, exams, and grades.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: No, definitely not.
