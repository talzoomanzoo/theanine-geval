Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\nWell, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol\nYeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise? \nI was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows.\nThat sounds wonderful! You'd get to just be out in nature all day. Sounds like a great job, especially if you're a bit introverted like me. That's why hiking is my favorite -- a good solitary activity. \nYes, I agree. What kind of hours would this new job have?\nIt's third shift, which isn't the greatest, but it pays a bit more than the other shifts, and I think I'll like getting off early in the morning. Then I can just go down and get in my hammock and have a nice relaxing moment after work. \nWould you feel safe being out there all alone, possibly falling asleep? That just sounds a bit risky.\nYeah, you know the area it's in. It's pretty safe, but I'm also a light sleeper. Thank you for your concern though. You are a good friend.\n\n[MEMORY]\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Working at a Grocery Store', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A talks about applying to work at a grocery store near the hiking trail.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: Will do, I'll ask him if he knows anyone how is looking to hire also. ### Speaker A: I applied to work at a grocery store.  ### Speaker B: Oh good!
