Not so much fun when the ladies are pregnant let me tell you! Are you much of a nightclubber or just straight drinking? ### Speaker A: Eh a little of both depending on how I am feeling.

Get the guitar out perhaps? ### Speaker A: Not really, I haven't spoken with any of those friends for a while. I mostly just go to music venues and I play a lot of music at home ### Speaker B: Yeah ok. Just thinking of going out to see some live music while I'm at home with a pregnancy. Getting a little jealous here let me tell you. ### Speaker A: My car has been running great, thanks to you. ### Speaker B: I'm glad to hear it. Have you been playing your guitar lately or seen any live bands? ### Speaker A: I try to go to a live event every week if I can. I haven't had time recently to play the guitar as I have been needing to use the bus to get about. Takes a lot longer using the bus than a car. ### Speaker B: Yeah I really don't like public transportation if I can avoid it. I'm happy to help with your car any time. Live music is great. I miss going to festivals. ### Speaker A: Did you find out what was wrong with the car in the end? Festivals are great, even better if you can camp out for a few days there. ### Speaker B: Yeah! I love camping out and they have such cool food there and all kinds of drinks. Love to sleep over and wake up to some great music. Yes, it's the alternator, but, don't worry, I'll get you a good price and repair it.

    "prediction": "OUTPUT:\n\nBrief explanation: The current DIALOGUE CONTEXT revolves around an invitation to stay at a friend's cabin for a Bluegrass show, which is unrelated to any past car repairs or live music events referenced in MEMORY. The past dialogue talks about car repairs and live music but doesn't provide specific information relevant or helpful to the decision about staying in the cabin for the Bluegrass show or about camping considerations for the wife. \n\nJudgement: No"
