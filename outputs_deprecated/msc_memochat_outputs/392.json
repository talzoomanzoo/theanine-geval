It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble.

    "raw_prediction": "It's important to be cautious with wild animals like raccoons to prevent any potential risks, especially if they might carry diseases. It's good that you're taking steps to handle the issue with the aluminum sheeting.",
    "prediction": "OUTPUT\n\nBrief explanation: The dialogue context involves a discussion about preventing raccoons from accessing garbage using aluminum sheeting, and someone suggesting befriending the raccoons with small bowls of food. The MEMORY contains relevant past discussion about similar topics including the use of aluminum sheeting for raccoons. This past information may help the language model craft a response that considers previously addressed concerns or techniques, corroborating the current strategy being explored in the context.\n\nJudgement: Yes"
