You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it.\nCool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot.
