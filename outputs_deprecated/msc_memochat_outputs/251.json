She won't get anywhere near us when my dad is working on a film.  ### Speaker A: I love watching horror movies with those people i would feel a little better as they are more scared than me.

It's more of a side hobby than an actual career for him. ### Speaker A: Seems like a good hobby i wish you would grow big to produce movies like the conjuring ### Speaker B: You never know! It's possible if he gets himself attached to a big-budget script. But for now we're content with smaller projects. At least it gives him more free time to fish!' }\n``` \n\n``` Recent Dialogs: \nSpeaker A: Have you thought about taking a chance and doing something creative and more fulfilling full time?
