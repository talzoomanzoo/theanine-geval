If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \nOh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with?\nI think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think?\nDoes it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point.\nYes, it contains eggs.  I think you would do well with the fried rice. It's best to cook the rice the day before.  \nI didn't know that. Why cook the rice beforehand? Is it better to age rice or something?\nThe rice needs to be cool before adding to the pan.  Are you able to take a passenger along in you truck?\nOh! That makes since. I didn't realize that the temperature made a difference when frying rice. As for the truck, Yes I can. But, depending on what company I'm working for at the time, they often set restrictions on passengers.\n\n[MEMORY]\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Pressure Cooker and Cooking Tips', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker A explains the use of a pressure cooker in cooking and provides tips on its benefits, recipes, and recommendations.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker B: What a tandoor?

The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is discussing recipes and cooking techniques for shrimp fried rice and the possibility of taking a passenger in a truck, which does not specifically require past information about pressure cookers to generate an appropriate response.
