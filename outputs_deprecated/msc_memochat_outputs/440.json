Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\nYes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it.\nCool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot. What is your favorite part about camping?\nI love being out in the wilderness and sleeping under the stars in the fresh air. It makes you realize how beautiful life is and how small we really are in comparison to the universe.\nI miss doing that! I have done lots of picnics with my family but it's been a long time since I've slept in a tent! Looking forward to it again when the kids are older. Where was the last place you went?\nWe went up to an island in the middle of nowhere in Canada. There were lots of bears and huge moose!\nWow, that sounds like such an adventure! I love to visit Canada. I have seen moose but never a bear! That must have been scary!\nYes, it is quite scary. We could also hear the wolves howling at night, luckily we didn't come across them though. One thing to note about bears, is they just want to come and scrounge for our food, so we learned to safely pack it away and hang it up high in a tree.\nYes, I've heard that it's important to be careful in bear country! I would love to see one in person though. Do you take lots of photos on your trips?\nYes, I took quite a few. The scenery was stunning. Would you like me to send you some photos? I know they are uninteresting to some people.\n\n[MEMORY]\nRelated Evidences: (1) {'Related Topics': 'Boy Scouts and Volunteer Work', 'Related Summaries': 'Speaker B shares his involvement in Boy Scouts and volunteer work, discussing the difference between Boy Scouts and Eagle Scouts.', 'Related Dialogues': '### Speaker A: Oh, yes!
