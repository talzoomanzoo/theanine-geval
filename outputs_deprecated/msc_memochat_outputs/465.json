    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear that you booked an excursion to visit the Acropolis in Athens! It's a must-see, especially if you're staying in the Plaka neighborhood. The Acropolis sits on top of a big hill and you can see it from many surrounding neighborhoods. I would recommend visiting the museum there first to learn all about what you are going to see. Enjoy your visit!",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT primarily requires information about the Acropolis in Athens, while the MEMORY contains information related to sightseeing in Rome and Greece. The memory mentions the Acropolis but provides no additional detail relevant to the current conversation or additional insights about the Acropolis itself beyond what is already being discussed.\nJudgement: No"
