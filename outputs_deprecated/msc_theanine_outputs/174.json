I'm waiting for the prices to go down a little. How's the weather there this week?\nSpeaker A: It's lovely this week! Clear skies and sunshine every single day\nSpeaker B: That sounds nice. It's been rainy here. Are there any good concerts coming up that you plan to see? Maybe I can plan my visit around that if the flights come through\nSpeaker A: Actually, yes! There are a few local artists performing in about 4 weeks, they'll be performing folk music. I'd love to take you out on the town and then enjoy that concert later in the evening if you're interested.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to it. Do you think I will need to rent a car when I'm there, or is it possible to walk and bike in the summer? I always picture huge amounts of snow but I'm not sure if it's like that all year round.\nSpeaker A: I would definitely recommend looking for a rental car to have on hand. There is a town within walking distance from me, but it can be dangerous to walk with the wolves and elk around, especially at night.\nSpeaker B: I imagine so!!! I wouldn't want to run into a wolf! Ok. I will add car rental to my plans. Do you get scared with your dogs, that you will run into wildilfe like that?\nSpeaker A: I think I'm more afraid of the wildlife than my dogs are. If I had to, I think I could muster the courage to face the animals out here, but I will happily avoid them when possible. With you around, I'd feel much better, as well. How do you feel about being that close to wildlife?\nSpeaker B: Well I don't have a lot of experience with that but I guess I'd be ok as long as I knew what to do. Most of the wildlife I see is squirrels, pigeons, and the occasional possum. \n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A used to have a long commute in Alaska, and now drives a smart car. They described Alaska as beautiful, suggesting cheap flights to Anchorage, which caused Speaker A to invite Speaker B to visit and look into flights. This led to Speaker B planning to visit Speaker A, interested in going to a concert and outdoor activities like petting a wolf and going on a glacier tour.\n\nSpeaker A used to have a long commute in Alaska, and now drives a smart car. They mentioned the \"midnight sun\" phenomenon in Alaska where the sun does not set during the summer, as well as the wildlife like elk and wolves. This caused Speaker A to mention making poached eggs for breakfast and taking sleds pulled by dogs.",
