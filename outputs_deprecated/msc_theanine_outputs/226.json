Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too?\nSpeaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also?\nSpeaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways?\nSpeaker B: They've been better as I left my previous job so I'm spending more time with them, how do you manage to work full time and still keep those animals happy?\nSpeaker A: I think working at the zoo so long has helped. Why did you leave your last job. Was that the one you were working in the warehouse? Sorry to hear about your dogs, it can be hard managing older animals.\nSpeaker B: Yea, that totally makes sense! I just wanted time off to spend with the dogs and look for a better job elsewhere, I'm hoping that I'll be able to get a job outside of a warehouse!\nSpeaker A: That is understandable. I didn't always think I would end up a zookeeper. Do you have anything in mind?\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B has elderly terriers as pets and is planning to leave their part-time job for a break before starting a new one. \nSpeaker A works at a zoo as a zookeeper and loves animals, especially white tigers, and is willing to help Speaker B get an entry-level position there. \nSpeaker A does not play music for the animals at the zoo to keep them calm, but has penguins at the zoo and enjoys working with animals, offering Speaker B a chance to help out.",
