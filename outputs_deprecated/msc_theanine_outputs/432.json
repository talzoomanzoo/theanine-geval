Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\nSpeaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it.\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B is involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout. \nSpeaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat. \nSpeaker B is considering attending a local community college for the first couple of years.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory doesn't contain any useful information for generating a response in this dialogue context, since the topic about Boy Scouts' training and Speaker A's inquiry about it has been sufficiently explained by Speaker B within the dialogue context. The memory content about college and youth retreats does not have direct relevance here.\nJudgement: No"
