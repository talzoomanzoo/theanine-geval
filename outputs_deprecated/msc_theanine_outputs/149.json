What do use for camping?\nSpeaker B: We usually do tents but we have camped in yurts too. Did you go to the zoo last weekend?\nSpeaker A: I see. Yes, I did make it to the zoo.  Have you gone to your local zoo?\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A enjoys visiting the zoo and grew up in big cities. This is why Speaker A goes to the zoo on a weekly basis and enjoys seeing tigers and monkeys. In contrast, Speaker B's daughter likes monkeys and is starting to assert her independence. On a similar note, Speaker B is interested in finding family discounts for the zoo as well as pushing for their daughter's school to take a field trip to the zoo.",
