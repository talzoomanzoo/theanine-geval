Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\nSpeaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it.\nSpeaker A: Cool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot. What is your favorite part about camping?\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout. This involvement has led Speaker A to appreciate Speaker B's dedication and invites them to a youth retreat. Speaker B wants to earn the Eagle Scout badge for college applications.\nSpeaker B is busy with scouts, school, work, and tennis, but is willing to take vacation days for the retreat. Additionally, Speaker B is considering attending a local community college for the first couple of years.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The information in MEMORY on Speaker B's experience in the Boy Scouts group is to some extent useful, since it reinforces his credibility in answering the questions about camping in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the information about the retreat, college applications, or Speaker B's other engagements is not crucial to the conversation context.\n\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
