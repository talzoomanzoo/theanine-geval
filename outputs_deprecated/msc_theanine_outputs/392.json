I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. \nSpeaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me.\nSpeaker A: Ohhh.  That would be bad. I really do not want more raccoons or other animals coming around.  I like them OK, but I do not want to have some diseased ones get close to the house. \n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A fosters dogs till they find a forever home. Speaker B works at a Raccoon Cafe and takes care of Bandicoot, a raccoon. Speaker B wants to train the raccoon and has been taking care of it for over a month. Speaker A is dealing with a raccoon problem and plans to buy aluminum sheeting to cover up holes.\n\nSpeaker A works in software solutions for tech companies and finds it less exciting than being a zoo keeper. Speaker A admires raccoons but has not interacted closely with them. Speaker B believes raccoons can make good pets if cared for properly. Speaker B's garbage has a lock to prevent animals from getting into it, especially during windy weather.\n\nSpeaker A works in software solutions for tech companies and finds it less exciting than being a zoo keeper. Speaker B works at a Raccoon Cafe and takes care of Bandicoot, a raccoon. Speaker B owns a raccoon named Bandicoot and a bearded dragon named Bob.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory contains relevant information about both Speaker A and Speaker B which includes their occupations, their attitudes towards raccoons, and what they do to manage interactions with raccoons. This information can be used by Speaker B to craft responses that are informed by both their own experiences with raccoons and their knowledge of Speaker A's situation and preferences.\nJudgement: Yes"
