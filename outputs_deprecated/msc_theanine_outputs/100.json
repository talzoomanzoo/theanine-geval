My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do.\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B is considering doing sledding with dogs while in Alaska, but needs to find out if it is daylight or darkness there. Speaker B's friend mentioned Alaska doesn't have 24-hour days like where they are. \nSpeaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking. Speaker B is unsure about other activities besides hiking in Alaska. \nSpeaker B is going to Alaska for a vacation in two weeks and has flying experience. Speaker A mentions outdoor activities planned for Alaska, such as hiking. \nSpeaker A has the impression that Alaska is cold and snowy, wondering if there are ski slopes there.",

    "raw_prediction": "You should check the daylight hours in Alaska, especially if you're planning on doing activities like sledding with dogs.",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY contains parts of the conversation that could be helpful to generate the response, such as the fact that Speaker B is considering sledding with dogs while in Alaska and needs to find out if it is daylight or darkness there (which is the exact same information in the dialogue context). Also, the fact that Speaker A is familiar with Alaska could potentially help the model generate a more informed response. However, the MEMORY doesn't provide any additional information regarding the daylight and darkness situation in Alaska, which is the main concern of Speaker B in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and might be crucial for the next response.\nJudgement: \"No\"."
