We enjoy lot and had Brazilian foods.\nSpeaker B: Oh that sounds fun! What is it about?\nSpeaker A: Black Widow is one of the character in the Marvel Avengers movies. Like Thor and Captain America. Have you seen any of those movies?\nSpeaker B: No I haven't seen any of those. What foods did you eat while watching the movie?\nSpeaker A: Wow, there are so many of the movies out there. Don't go see Black Widow without watching Avengers first. I had an amazing steak and vegetables on the side that were delicious. What is you favorite food? \nSpeaker B: Oh ok I definitely will watch those first! I love both steak and vegetables! I am a real foodie and love just about everything that isn't too strange to try lol.\nSpeaker A: Oh wow! Do you like sushi? I love it but the sea urchin is a little crazy lol. Have you ever eaten sea urchin?\nSpeaker B: I have never tried sea urchin or sushi but I do like crab legs and shrimp! Do you ever consider any foods to be good for healing? I find that you do healing very fascinating!\nSpeaker A: Yes, in fact I consider almost all foods to either be healing, harmful or neutral. In my opinion people should choose foods based on how they want to feel. Sushi is fresh and healthy so I considerate it to be very healing.\nSpeaker B: That is very wise thinking. Which vegetables do you feel are the best for healing? Are there any that should be avoided?\nSpeaker A: I feel that most leafy green vegetables are healthy, but it depends on the specific person's needs. For example some people need to avoid nightshades, like potatoes, etc. while other people can eat them without any problems. Overall, a diet with a variety of colors is good when it comes to vegetables\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B is interested in trying healing methods mentioned by Speaker A. Speaker B's sister joins them on the water and takes a nap in a hammock. Speaker B enjoys sailing during the summer for the best \"scenery\" and has a houseboat where they spend time with their family.\n\nSpeaker A recommends self-massage, essential oils, reiki, meditation, and self-awareness for healing. Speaker A finds being on the water therapeutic and relaxing. Speaker B goes sailing during the summer for the best \"scenery\" and enjoys sailing, spending time with family on a houseboat.\n\nSpeaker A is involved in healing work and mentions hot latina salsa. Speaker A and their brother enjoy going to a Brazilian steakhouse for dinner. Speaker B has one sibling, a little brother, who enjoys Brazilian food, specifically steak.",
