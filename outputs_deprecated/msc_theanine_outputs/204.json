Do you miss it?\nSpeaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \nSpeaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living.\nSpeaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime?\nSpeaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with.\nSpeaker A: Sounds great! Now the tough question: when do you have time?\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket but now plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week. They are a member of a soccer team and enjoy playing in tournaments. \nSpeaker A is a college student majoring in Humanities, not currently employed but used to work part-time at a supermarket. Lately, Speaker A has been scoring well in soccer.",
