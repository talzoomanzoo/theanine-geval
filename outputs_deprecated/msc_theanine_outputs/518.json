Are you going to visit your sons in Europe soon?\nSpeaker A: Yes!  As a matter of fact, I'm visiting my son that lives in Spain next month.  This will give me a chance to finally meet his girlfriend of three years now!\nSpeaker B: Oh nice. You must be looking forward to it. He must have told you a lot about her. Do you think you would like her?\nSpeaker A: I think so.  She seems like a very sweet girl and she seems to care deeply about my son, so that's what matters most.  You know, maybe I can stop by and visit you as well, since you live in Europe.  France, Spain, Italy?  Where are you living now?\nSpeaker B: Bless her, that's good to hear. That would be great! I live in Portugal. It's not too far from Spain. We can always arrange something. How long would you be there for?\nSpeaker A: I'm planning to stay in Spain for three weeks.  Since you live in Portugal, I'd love to stop by for a visit if you're free this coming month.  I've always wanted to visit Lisbon.  It has the world's longest bridge!\nSpeaker B: That'a great idea. We have a holiday house just outside of Lisbon. You are welcome to lodge with us.\nSpeaker A: Sounds great!  I'm already very excited about my trip to Spain, and now I get to visit you in Lisbon!  I need to brush up on my Spanish and also start studying Portuguese.\nSpeaker B: Haha, you've got your hands full then. Portuguese would be easier I believe. Spanish is a bit harder because it is spoken quicker. Would you be travelling with any company?\nSpeaker A: No, I'll be traveling solo this time around.  My husband does not have a lot of vacation time, so I'll be on my own.  In the meantime, I'll start watching soap operas in Spanish and Portuguese.  They can be so exciting!\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A has two sons who have been studying abroad in Spain and are going to Italy next, with at least one of them in a relationship with a Spanish girlfriend. It seems that Speaker A's son and his girlfriend are studying to be chefs in college. Additionally, Speaker A's sons play video games and listen to music in their rooms, while Speaker B is trying to encourage one of their sons to get into programming or writing, but the son is more interested in gaming with friends.",
