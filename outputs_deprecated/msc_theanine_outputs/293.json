If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \nSpeaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with?\nSpeaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point.\nSpeaker A: Yes, it contains eggs.  I think you would do well with the fried rice. It's best to cook the rice the day before.  \nSpeaker B: I didn't know that. Why cook the rice beforehand? Is it better to age rice or something?\nSpeaker A: The rice needs to be cool before adding to the pan.  Are you able to take a passenger along in you truck?\nSpeaker B: Oh! That makes since. I didn't realize that the temperature made a difference when frying rice. As for the truck, Yes I can. But, depending on what company I'm working for at the time, they often set restrictions on passengers.\nSpeaker A: The rice tends to stick together if it's warm.  I would like to ride along with you sometime when you're able.\nSpeaker B: I actually have a scheduled haul for next Wednesday. Do you want to come along for that ride? It should take about five hours.\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B lives in a rural area with a farm and can relate to cooking. This allows Speaker B to easily understand the cooking process and ingredients. Speaker A bakes muffins and bread but is conscious of their impact on their weight, showing a consideration for healthy eating habits. Speaker A is interested in running a business with their cooking skills, indicating a potential entrepreneurial spirit. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker, showing a willingness to explore new culinary techniques. \n\nSpeaker A is from the south of India and prefers warm summer weather, influencing their cooking preferences towards Indian cuisine and rice dishes. Speaker A primarily cooks Indian food and bakes a lot of rice dishes, showcasing their culinary expertise in these specific areas. Speaker A is a cook and enjoys using a pressure cooker for recipes like dahl, pilaf rice, and tandoori chicken, highlighting their diverse cooking skills and preferences.\n\nSpeaker B does not cook, but enjoys listening to country music and drives trucks for a living. This contrasts with Speaker B's husband, who is a skilled cook specializing in Asian cuisine with extensive prep work.",
