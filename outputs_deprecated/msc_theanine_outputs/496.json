Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\nSpeaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise? \nSpeaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows.\nSpeaker A: That sounds wonderful! You'd get to just be out in nature all day. Sounds like a great job, especially if you're a bit introverted like me. That's why hiking is my favorite -- a good solitary activity. \nSpeaker B: Yes, I agree. What kind of hours would this new job have?\nSpeaker A: It's third shift, which isn't the greatest, but it pays a bit more than the other shifts, and I think I'll like getting off early in the morning. Then I can just go down and get in my hammock and have a nice relaxing moment after work. \nSpeaker B: Would you feel safe being out there all alone, possibly falling asleep? That just sounds a bit risky.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, you know the area it's in. It's pretty safe, but I'm also a light sleeper. Thank you for your concern though. You are a good friend.\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A is on a cross-country journey looking for jobs and new camping gear, specifically a hammock. This leads Speaker A to apply to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail. Speaker A also plans to leave a hammock by the river for anyone to use at a hidden spot off the main hiking trail. Additionally, there is a lake at the hiking trail, and Speaker A suggests swimming in it, warning that the water may be cold.",
