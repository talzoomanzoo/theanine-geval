If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \nSpeaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with?\nSpeaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point.\nSpeaker A: Yes, it contains eggs.  I think you would do well with the fried rice. It's best to cook the rice the day before.  \nSpeaker B: I didn't know that. Why cook the rice beforehand? Is it better to age rice or something?\nSpeaker A: The rice needs to be cool before adding to the pan.  Are you able to take a passenger along in you truck?\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A enjoys cooking and baking, possibly considering turning it into a business. This interest in cooking leads Speaker A to primarily cook Indian food and bake a lot of rice dishes. Speaker A also bakes muffins and bread but is conscious of their impact on their weight. Additionally, Speaker A recommends the pressure cooker for its efficiency and ease of use, suggesting it to Speaker B who is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker.",
