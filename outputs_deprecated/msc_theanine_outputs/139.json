Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\nSpeaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach?\nSpeaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option.\nSpeaker A: Yes I think history is interesting, too! Both of those subjects would be great because there are probably lots of teaching jobs. What kind of history do you like?\nSpeaker B: I love all sorts of history. Right now I am really getting into the weeds of World War II. There's so much to unpack.\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B, majoring in linguistics and aspiring to turn it into a practical job, causes Speaker A to be interested in teaching computer science, particularly in the field of robotics.\nSpeaker B, living with their mom and currently in college, wants to pursue a masters degree after finishing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. This leads Speaker B to feel limited in job opportunities but also sparks an interest in studying linguistics.\nSpeaker B, majoring in linguistics and hoping to turn it into a practical job, wants Speaker A, who is studying computer science and aims to develop apps for differently abled youth, to be interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics.",

    "raw_prediction": "World War II is such a fascinating period to study. The impact it had on the world is immense. Have you considered specializing in a particular aspect of history for your teaching career?",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory contains information about Speaker B's studies in linguistics and a potential interest to become a college professor in this field. However, the dialogue context does not make reference to these facts, but rather responds to Speaker B's interest in teaching English or History. Thus, the memory does not provide any additional relevant information to assist the language model in formulating a response.\nJudgement: No"
