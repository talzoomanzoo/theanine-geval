Where are you going on vacation?\nSpeaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there!\nSpeaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo?\nSpeaker B: Their zoo is pretty good! It's always crowded, of course, but they have pandas so I'm happy. I would say it's bigger than the DC zoo, but I like that the DC zoo has fewer people.\nSpeaker A: That sounds awesome.  I haven't been to the zoo in so long.  I wish I could go.\nSpeaker B: You should go with your sister! she can bring her dog. They probably have all kinds of exotic birds...\nSpeaker A: That's a great idea!  I'm not sure how good her dog would do around other animals though.  She always barks like crazy whenever she sees any kind of animal.\nSpeaker B: Oh, that's a good point. Maybe keep her away from the small rodent house and reptiles, eh?\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A enjoys gardening and reading, while Speaker B enjoys visiting the zoo, especially to see pandas and penguins. Speaker A decides to go to the zoo with their sister, who is a dog person with a yellow lab. Speaker B's girlfriend, who loves pandas and penguins, has a noisy cockatoo and they visit the zoo regularly. Speaker B is open to being a cool uncle to his sister's future children but does not want kids of his own.",
