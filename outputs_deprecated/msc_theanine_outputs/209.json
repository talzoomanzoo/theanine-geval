I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field?\nSpeaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate?\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B, as the only child of Speaker B's mother who runs a local high school, is studying sports medicine and plays soccer, aiming to join their college team in the future. Speaker A, offering advice and encouragement to Speaker B on the internship hunt, brings up the medical field. Speaker A used to surf when they were younger, contrasting with Speaker B's current lack of skill in surfing. However, Speaker A is trying to get back into surfing. Speaker B, a college student who plays soccer with peers, is now seeking internships in sports medicine and has approached professors for recommendation letters. Additionally, Speaker B is training for soccer and aspires to make the school team as a walk-on player.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY contains background information on Speaker B's studies and career aspirations, Speaker A's past profession and current hobbies. However, this information does not seem to be of great relevance to the dialogue context. The dialogue context requires the response of Speaker B to the question about how much longer before they graduate, not about other details related to their studies or about Speaker A's history or hobbies. The MEMORY could give additional depth to the dialogue, but isn't necessary for a precise answer.\n\nJudgement: \"No\""
