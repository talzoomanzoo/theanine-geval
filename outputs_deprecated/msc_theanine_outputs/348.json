Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar.\nSpeaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general?\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners.

Speaker A's attachment to the jello, their favorite flavor, or the fact that it is a tradition in their family does not aid Speaker B's response about whether they will lay off jello or desserts in general due to weight gain. \nJudgement: \"No\""
