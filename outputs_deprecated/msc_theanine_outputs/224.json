Do you have trouble with your dogs getting into food too?\nSpeaker B: Well fortunately they can't open the fridge just yet! But yea sometimes they manage to get into other stuff, especially when I leave it out! Does Sid try to get into food also?\nSpeaker A: Sid is far more well behaved then Journey when it comes to food out. The worst Sid can do is escape from his cage once in awhile. How are your dogs doing anyways?\nSpeaker B: They've been better as I left my previous job so I'm spending more time with them, how do you manage to work full time and still keep those animals happy?\nSpeaker A: I think working at the zoo so long has helped. Why did you leave your last job. Was that the one you were working in the warehouse? Sorry to hear about your dogs, it can be hard managing older animals.\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B has two terrier dogs as pets. Speaker A works at a zoo and has tried playing music for the white tigers and home concerts for their pets. Speaker B is looking for a new job and is excited about the opportunity at the zoo. Speaker B has elderly terriers and is planning to leave their part-time job for a break before starting a new one.\nSpeaker A has penguins at the zoo and enjoys working with animals, offering Speaker B a chance to help out. Speaker A mentions having dogs and Speaker B admires them for their peaceful nature. Speaker B asks Speaker A if they have had a pet raccoon before.",
