Can you tell me about it?\nSpeaker B: Yes!  You can't miss it, especially if you are staying in the Plaka neighborhood.   The acroplis sits on the top of the big hill.  You can see if from  much of the surrounding neighborhoods.   I would recommend visiting the museum that is there first to learn all about what you are about to see. \nSpeaker A: I definitely will, this sounds like such an amazing trip. How long has it been since you've been there yourself?\nSpeaker B: I was in Greece last two years ago.   I am excited to go again soon!    At somepoint I would like to take a cruise around the islands there.  It seems like a neat way to see all the Islands in an easy way.   Have you ever taken a cruise?\nSpeaker A: Only once before when I was very young, so I don't remember much. It sounds like such a relaxing way to enjoy the day, though. Maybe we can plan a cruise together sometime.\nSpeaker B: That would be fun!  I go to Europe a lot so maybe a cruise in the Caribbean would be nice.  I would like to see Saint Lucia and Saint Thomas. \nSpeaker A: Oh, Europe? I'm already sold on the idea, sounds like a blast! I've never had a negative experience in Europe. Should we visit some of the capital cities?\nSpeaker B: I would like to go to Paris.  Since I live in Amsterdam I could take the train down.  I have seen much and Italy and Greece but would love to go to Paris.  Have you been there before? \nSpeaker A: Only once, and I had a really great time there. The buildings were so beautiful and the food was delicious. Do you like French food?\nSpeaker B: I do like French food- but it is very rich.  I especially love French desserts like macarons.   I would like to see the museums in Paris. \n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both enjoy reading and are librarians. Speaker B is excited about visiting Greece for the first time and loves Athena, considering her a perfect goddess for a librarian. Speaker B is planning a trip to Greece in the next three months with a family of five.

Speaker A has traveled around Europe before, visiting capital cities of each country.
