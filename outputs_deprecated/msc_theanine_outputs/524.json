It was great. What sort of art museum are you going to?\nSpeaker A: The museum has all sorts of galleries.  It has a sculpture garden outside.  I mostly like the impressionist paintings.  I like Van Gogh.  Was your concert outdoors?\nSpeaker B: Yes. That way they could have a fireworks show too. I love fireworks. Have you ever seen the fireworks at the Disney castle?\nSpeaker A: No, but I have been to Disney World in Florida.  I love fireworks too.  I want to get married on the 4th of July.  That was we will have a national holiday and fireworks for us every year!  It sounds like you've been to Disneyland?\nSpeaker B: No, but I thought you might have since you lived in LA for awhile. Did you get to see any live Disney music performances while you were at Disney World?\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B drove over 1000 miles to see their favorite band, Three Dog Night. This causes Speaker B to enjoy living in the city for the accessibility to food and live music, which is the same topic Speaker A enjoys, along with going to museums and trying different foods. This leads Speaker A to plan a visit to the Museum of Art of São Paulo next week with their boyfriend.\nSpeaker B has 2 older and 1 younger brother, and their father used to be a farmer, and was born in Brazil, specifically in San Paulo. This same topic is of interest to Speaker A, who is planning a trip to Sao Paulo and is interested in music concerts, leading to a visit to the Museum of Art of São Paulo next week with their boyfriend.\nSpeaker A loves Disney music, which is the same topic Speaker B enjoys, along with living in the city for the accessibility to food and live music. This makes Speaker A want to attend music concerts and plan a trip to Sao Paulo, eventually leading to a visit to the Museum of Art of São Paulo next week with their boyfriend.",

    "raw_prediction": "I did get to see some live Disney music performances at Disney World. It was so magical! Do you have a favorite Disney song?",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: MEMORY provides information about Speaker B's passion for live music and the fact that Speaker B drove over 1000 miles to see their favorite band, Three Dog Night. This could be useful in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as it would help to fortify their connection on the topic of music. Also, it mentions Speaker A's love for Disney music, which ties in to the question Speaker B asked about Disney music performances. However, information about Sao Paulo and the Museum of Art of São Paulo seems irrelevant based on the given context. \nJudgement: Yes"
