Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\nSpeaker A: Oh wow you can complete therapy? I thought it was just something you did forever! That's good to know.\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B, as a therapist, discusses the challenges and rewards of the profession. They also express concerns about the costs associated with owning horses and explore the psychological aspects of horse ownership in relation to Freudian theories. \nSpeaker B's mother being a nurse led to their career as a therapist. They express a desire to have a horse in the future and contemplate the psychological aspects of horse ownership through Freudian theories. \nSpeaker A is experienced in horse breeding and care, working at a stable and enjoying being around horses. They transition from their expertise in horses to their lack of knowledge in psychology.",
