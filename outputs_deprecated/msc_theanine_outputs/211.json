I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field?\nSpeaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate?\nSpeaker B: I have another year- so this year is really important I get internships and start making connections in the field.   I love going to the beach too.  What happened with your knees that now cause you so much pain?\nSpeaker A: I think age has really been my knees downfall. I also used to hike a lot and I put a lot of pressure on my legs. That is great that you only have a year. Maybe when you graduate you can come hang out on the beach with me. I can't surf but I would love to watch you.\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A mentions their neighbor John who loves soccer, which causes Speaker B to be interested in sports medicine and enjoy surfing. This leads Speaker A to offer advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field.\n\nSpeaker B's mother runs a local high school, and Speaker B is her only child. This connection leads Speaker B to go to the beach a lot and learn to surf from friends in Jersey. Speaker A suggests that surfing could be a way for Speaker B to make connections in the medical field.",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a plan! I'll definitely take you up on that offer to hang out at the beach after I graduate. It'll be a nice break from the internship hunt.",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory provides background information about Speaker B's interest in sports medicine and surfing, as well as information about her family context that seems relevant to the dialogue. Even though Speaker A and B have already discussed surfing in the dialogue, knowing that surfing could potentially help Speaker B make connections can be useful for generating future responses.\nJudgement: Yes"
