Where did you go on your walk?\nSpeaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous.\nSpeaker B: That sounds amazing! Did you bring a pet? I love doing the harder trails with my dog. Sometimes, it's very peaceful to get away from everything.\nSpeaker A: No, I don't have any pets; my apartment seems too small for a dog and I would worry about them being lonely all day when I'm at work. I was thinking about getting a pair of cats, but I haven't committed yet. How nice fo ryou to have company when you're walking though! What kind of dog do you have?\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B is an artist who walks through nature for work. This helps Speaker B find inspiration for their artwork. Speaker A is a city dweller who walks to work instead of driving. This also helps Speaker A stay active and healthy.",
