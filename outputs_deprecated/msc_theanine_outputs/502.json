The Memory provides information about previous interactions and discussions about the lotto related to both speakers. Thus, the memory can help in providing a relevant response for the AI model. The fact that both speakers have bought lotto tickets in the past and discussed strategies can offer context to the dialogue.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
