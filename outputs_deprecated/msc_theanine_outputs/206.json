Do you miss it?\nSpeaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \nSpeaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living.\nSpeaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime?\nSpeaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with.\nSpeaker A: Sounds great! Now the tough question: when do you have time?\nSpeaker B: It would have to be sometime when I'm off work, maybe on the weekend. \nSpeaker A: OK. Just let me know when you want to plan it and I will put in the reservation request. Do you need to borrow cleats or anything? I am a size 11.5.\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket, but now plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week. Additionally, Speaker A is a member of a soccer team and enjoys playing in tournaments. \nSpeaker B played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United. \nSpeaker A enjoys playing soccer and is studying Humanities in college with the goal of finishing before looking for a job. They are seeking career advice from a guidance counselor and considering options in humanities or teaching.",
