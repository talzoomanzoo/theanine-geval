It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \nSpeaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on?\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B is studying sports medicine in college, which causes Speaker A to wish for better grades and hope for a soccer scholarship. Speaker A struggles to maintain good grades and excels only in gym class.\n\nSpeaker B, who is studying sports medicine in college, finds history class boring just like Speaker A. Both of them are dealing with the challenges of school. Speaker B, feeling overwhelmed by their mother's strictness, is eager to finish school to escape it.\n\nSpeaker B's dedication to studying sports medicine in college has resulted in getting all A's in the class. This success puts pressure on Speaker B to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother, who happens to run the school.",
