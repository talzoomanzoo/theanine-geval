    "prediction": "Brief explanation: Memory does not help generate an appropriate next response for Speaker A. While the memory mentions Speaker A's love for visiting the zoo frequently, Speaker B's question does not leave room for Speaker A to express their fondness for the zoo. Rather, it's a simple yes/no question requiring Speaker A to answer whether they went to the zoo last weekend.\nJudgement: No"
