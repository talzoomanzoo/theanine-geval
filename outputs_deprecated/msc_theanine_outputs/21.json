It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\nSpeaker A: I will! Is there a city you like to visit nearby while cruising in your car?\nSpeaker B: Yes, there are several. Hope we could meet and You possibly teach me about computer programming.\nSpeaker A: That would be great too. I like to program in several different languages. Do you have a preference?\nSpeaker B: No, I'm just getting started so I don't have a preference. Maybe you could show me what you prefer and we could start there.\nSpeaker A: Sure. I usually like to start with html and css so we can start there. We'll order some pizzaburgers to help us out. \n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A offers to teach Speaker B how to swim and programming, despite Speaker B not knowing how to swim but enjoying watching swimming movies. Speaker B also enjoys punk music and wants to listen to it while swimming and learning programming. Additionally, Speaker A has planned a cruise to the Caribbeans, and both Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the potential of getting on a cruise ship together while enjoying cruising in their car listening to punk music.",
