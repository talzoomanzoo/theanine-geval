Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know. \nSpeaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like.\nSpeaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too.\nSpeaker B: Nice! Is anyone coming with you?\nSpeaker A: Just my doggy Drunky.  You never know,  I might meet a nice lady out there. \n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A enjoys Mexican food and drinks, and plays music for fun. Speaker A also enjoys going to bars and loves the ladies. Both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n\nSpeaker A owns a Subaru Legacy and mentions having a baby on the way. Speaker B is not going out drinking much due to their wife's pregnancy. Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day. Speaker A is not sure if they will ever settle down with a partner and have kids.\n\nSpeaker B is a mechanic who enjoys working on cars. Speaker B is feeling a bit jealous of Speaker A's ability to go out and enjoy live music while they are at home with the pregnancy. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The useful information in the memory is about Speaker B's wife being pregnant which might make it clear why Speaker B and his wife would want to stay in a cabin instead of camping during the festival. The context of their discussion makes more sense with this piece of information.\nJudgement: Yes"
