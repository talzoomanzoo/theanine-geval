Have you ever been there?\nSpeaker A: No, I have never been to Costa Rica, but it sounds like it will be very educational as well as relaxing. I have been to Canada a few times and also Mexico.

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY contains information about Speaker B's trip to Costa Rica and Speaker A's more quiet spring breaks. This is consistent with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and it might be useful if the conversation is further focusing on their spring breaks. However, the information about Speaker B's hair color experimentation is irrelevant to the discussion at the moment.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
