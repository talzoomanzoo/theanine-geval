My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to?\nSpeaker A: I recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca. It was super cute and made me want to go visit Italy, but that was too expensive, so instead I booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month. What about you?\nSpeaker B: I have been relaxing with the kids as much as I have. My husband has been busy with work, so we haven't had time for anything big. I would love to visit Italy some day though if we get the chance. Have you ever been to Italy before?\nSpeaker A: I have never gone to Italy because I'm always so busy. If I ever go, I would want to spend a month there, but work has been hectic lately. Would your kids go with you if you went to Italy?\nSpeaker B: Absolutely! I'd love to travel all over the world with my family to see everything. Hawaii sounds like just as much fun though. What are you most excited about doing when you get there?\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A recently watched the Disney movie 'Luca' and found it super cute, which made them want to visit Italy.\nSpeaker B used to enjoy watching movies with her kids, but now prefers romance and horror movies. However, their kids really enjoyed watching 'Luca' and thought it was good.\nSpeaker A and Speaker B both enjoy sunsets and movies, with Speaker A preferring the beach for watching sunsets. Speaker A has booked a \"Hawaii Sunset\" tour for next month and is excited about it being their first time.",
