Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B enjoys being a therapist and a football fan, supporting the Chiefs, and also mentions the ups and downs of the profession. Speaker B is concerned about the cost of owning horses, including medical fees and expenses like horse shoes. Speaker B is considering the psychological aspects of owning a horse, relating it to Freudian theories. \nSpeaker B offers to talk about the absence of Speaker A's mother and suggests lying down on their couch, while mentioning the ups and downs of being a therapist.
