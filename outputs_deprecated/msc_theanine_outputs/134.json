Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics. Speaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job.\nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science. Speaker B is considering getting a master's degree after completing their bachelor's and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. Speaker B is studying linguistics but mentions feeling limited in job opportunities.\nSpeaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job. Speaker A and B both value education and continuous learning.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY provides background information that aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Speaker B studying linguistics with hopes of turning this into a practical job which now seems to be teaching. Also, Speaker A's interest in teaching robotics and his connection with computer science informs his statement on wanting to teach robotics. \nJudgement: Yes"
