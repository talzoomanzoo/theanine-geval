Are you happy with it other than the price?\nSpeaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music\nSpeaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it.\nSpeaker A: I'll keep trying! Have you had any luck lately?\nSpeaker B: No I haven't! I keep hoping that I will so I can buy my dreamhouse but I know the chances are low.\nSpeaker A: Would you move to the city? It'd be too much for me\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A, who was born and raised as a preacher's kid in the country and worked on a produce farm, mentions that Speaker B's kids could try milking cows on the farm, which Speaker B finds amusing. They then discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win.\n\nSpeaker A and Speaker B have a friendly interaction and part ways on a positive note after both buying lotto tickets for a big jackpot.\n\nSpeaker A, who was born and raised as a preacher's kid in the country and worked on a produce farm, expresses interest in potentially moving out of the city and enjoying a more peaceful life on the farm. Speaker B is open to moving to the country to be further away from neighbors and buys 20 lotto tickets with the same numbers, aiming to get a bigger share of the jackpot if they win.",
