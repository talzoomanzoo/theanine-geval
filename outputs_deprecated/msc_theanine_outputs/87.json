It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip? \nSpeaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery\nSpeaker B: Yes I think that's a great idea, how is work at the library? \nSpeaker A: Busy, and demanding because we are short staffed. While there seems to be little need for a library these days, I find that we have less staff to get everything done\nSpeaker B: Well if you ever need someone to come and help for a couple of hours here and there, give me a call, you know how much I love to be in the library anyway\nSpeaker A: I will keep that in mind as we do have volunteer hours available. How is your family doing these days?\nSpeaker B: Well I would be happy to help. My family are all great thank you for asking I took the grandkids to the park again we had a great time. How's your family doing? \nSpeaker A: They are good. I wish I coudl spend more time with them but my job is keeping me busy. I do hope they take up some hobbies that involve the outdoors or something more creative.\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B mentioning having grandkids implies they are older and have a family of their own. Speaker B enjoys spending time with their grandkids at the park, causing them to like the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\nSpeaker A being busy with work and unable to spend as much time with their kids as they would like makes Speaker A want to spend more time with their family. Speaker B enjoying time with their grandkids at the park triggers Speaker A to wish their family would take up hobbies involving the outdoors or something more creative.",
