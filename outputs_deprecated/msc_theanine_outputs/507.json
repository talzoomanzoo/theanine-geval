Are you happy with it other than the price?\nSpeaker A: I am. I like listening to Blues on it, plus there are apps to help mix music\nSpeaker B: I do love that about the iphone, the ability to mix music. Maybe you will win the lotto and that will help pay for the expense of it.\nSpeaker A: I'll keep trying! Have you had any luck lately?\nSpeaker B: No I haven't! I keep hoping that I will so I can buy my dreamhouse but I know the chances are low.\nSpeaker A: Would you move to the city? It'd be too much for me\nSpeaker B: I would love to be able to have a country house and a city house to be able to come and go to each one as I please. doesn't that sound like a dream come true?\nSpeaker A: It would be convenient for seeing concerts in the city, yes. I'm not used to the business, though\nSpeaker B: Yeah I understand that. Have you listened to any new blues songs lately?\nSpeaker A: I've started a playlist but haven't had time yet. Any recommendations for female blues performers?\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A and Speaker B have a friendly interaction and part ways on a positive note. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B and their family could stay over at the farm after the concert, as they both dream of having a city and country house or a summer and winter home. Speaker A and Speaker B discuss different strategies for playing the lotto and the potential outcomes if they win, as they both bought lotto tickets for a big jackpot. \n\nSpeaker A has never been to college and values the peaceful life of working on the farm. Speaker B expresses interest in potentially moving out of the city and enjoying a more peaceful life on the farm, as they both dream of having a city and country house or a summer and winter home.",

Therefore, while it helps in understanding the overall context of the conversation, it doesn't assist in specifically answering Speaker A's last question. \nJudgement: \"No\""
