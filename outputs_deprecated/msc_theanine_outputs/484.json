Hopefully you motivated some people to run. How about this? I need a motivational speaker to motivate me, to help motivate my friend to run again. Know anyone? \nSpeaker B: It was amazing and I just just know that I really changed some people's lives for the better. I cannot believe how blessed I am, how blessed we all are really (consider that my application to be your motivational speaker!).\nSpeaker A: You'll have to bring your A game because the hot weather has made me not want to even leave my air conditioned house lately.lol\nSpeaker B: I am up for the challenge! I have a few tricks up my sleeve to deal with people like you.\nSpeaker A: Oh geez that makes me sound difficult.lol  Do you have any new speeches coming up?\nSpeaker B: Nope, I just cleared my schedule until the Alps marathon that you're training for. It's just you and me until you break that finish line. I'm going to start sending you a motivational quote every morning at 4 am when I want you to wake up.\nSpeaker A: Wow 4 am.  Is it too late to change my mind?lol\nSpeaker B: Yes. We have an iron-clad written agreement. Tell me how I'm doing so far. Is this the most motivated you've ever been in your entire life?\nSpeaker A: No, but that's why I have you.  You're going to push me to do the things I can't bring myself to do.  I'll have more motivation tomorrow.  Today was a long work day.lol\nSpeaker B: I'm going to try a new motivational technique with you. Would you be more frightened by a spider or a snake. I need to know before we meet up this weekend.\n\n[MEMORY]\n1. Speaker A, a runner who has visited 20 countries, is now training for marathons and seeking advice on how to recover, which caused Speaker A to invite Speaker B to run together and train for the Alps marathon, offering motivation and meeting at the beach at 0600.\n\n2. Speaker A, a runner who has visited 20 countries, is now training for marathons and seeking advice on how to recover, which is a similar topic to Speaker B being a motivational speaker who travels to schools and conferences to give pep talks, and Speaker B joked about combining fishing with feeling depressed, and mentioned taking young boys to the pond during school hours.\n\n3. Speaker B, from San Francisco, who enjoys fishing and the outdoors, has run a marathon before and found it tough but rewarding, and wants Speaker A, who is training for marathons and seeking advice on how to recover, to combine something more active with feeling depressed to avoid dwelling on negative thoughts.",
