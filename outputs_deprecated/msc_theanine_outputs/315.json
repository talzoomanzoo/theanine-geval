I want some suggestion from you.\nSpeaker B: Plum trees and pair trees would be my suggestion in the summer when they blossom they have such a lovely flower on them\nSpeaker A: IN MY HOME?! A TREE? That was not at all what I was thinking. Do they grow well indoors? I am intrigued. \nSpeaker B: Well if you want to make it like a proper garden experience then I would suggest going all in, and go for the best most authentic looking items you could get \nSpeaker A: Wow! Ok! This is sounding like a bigger undertaking! Should I embrace bugs in the home if they help the plants or am I getting wild?\nSpeaker B: Well from my experince bugs do the complete opposite and don't help at all, so avoid that at all costs! Fertilizers are the way to go to help with growth.\nSpeaker A: Oh man. I have lots to learn. What is the lifespan of a plum tree?\nSpeaker B: around 10 to 15 years but if you take care of them I'm sure you could get 20 out of it.\nSpeaker A: Now we are also talking commitment! This is not how I expected my day to go! I am excited, yet so nervous! \nSpeaker B: It doesn't take too much time to do per day so after school give it a little water and that should keep them in great way. Speaking off school how are you getting on?\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B is knowledgeable about plants and gardening, with a thriving garden. Speaker B is working on a teleportation machine that is currently small and requires substantial energy sources. Speaker B mentions the Chinese advancements in thermal nuclear generators and the need for a Manhattan Project for alternative energy. Speaker B is also interested in space exploration and plant science, expressing concerns about the fuels used for space travel. ",
