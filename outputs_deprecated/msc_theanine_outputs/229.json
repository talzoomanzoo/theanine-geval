    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY is useful because it gives context to who owns the kittens and why they would be naming them. It would give Speaker B a basis for how to answer the question from Speaker A, such as if they have considered any Mandarin names based on the kittens' personalities, or if they've decided to take Speaker A's suggestion of the name Zhao.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
