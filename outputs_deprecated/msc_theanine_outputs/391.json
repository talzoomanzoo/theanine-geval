I'm going to install it today and I'll let you know how my raccoon problem goes. \nSpeaker B: I hope it goes well for you. How come you don't just leave small bowls of food out and befriend the raccoons? It would solve your problem a lot faster, especially because raccoon's are so smart. Bandicoot knows how to open and unlock so many things, it's makes it difficult to keep him out of trouble. Which is why I take him to work with me.\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B, who works as a zoo keeper and enjoys it, has been taking care of the raccoon for over a month and is interested in training it. Speaker B also considers raccoons intelligent and funny, and believes they can make good pets if cared for properly. Additionally, Speaker B's garbage has a lock to prevent animals from getting into it, especially during windy weather. Speaker B has a dog named Bandicoot and is willing to bring him over for extra company.",
