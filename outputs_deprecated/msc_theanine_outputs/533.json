He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies!\nSpeaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?  \nSpeaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere!\nSpeaker B: You have a point.  It is nice to see puppies wagging their tail and just following you!  Changing topics, do you have any recipes with asparagus?  You know, it's such a popular vegetable, but I just don't know how to prepare it.\n\n[MEMORY]\n- Speaker A used to foster puppies but no longer does because they are busy with work, and now mainly cares for dogs at the animal shelter, but also cats, and loves when new puppies are brought in.\n- Speaker A's interest in science over music contrasts with Speaker B's love for Black Sabbath and grilling meat, but they both share a passion for animals, especially puppies, and visiting shelters in every city they go to.",
