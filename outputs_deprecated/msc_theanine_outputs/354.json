Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar.\nSpeaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general?\nSpeaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts.\nSpeaker A: How's learning to bake going in general, especially now that you're off desserts?\nSpeaker B: I one of those people how have to fail a couple of times before I get the hang of it, but I'm getting there.  Have you and the kids had any chance to go skiing lately?\nSpeaker A: Water skiing? Yes, last weekend. It was so much fun!\nSpeaker B: (sorry my typing sucks)  That's awesome. I wish had access to a boat, but who knows, maybe one day. \nSpeaker A: Boating is so fun. You could go wakeboarding more often if you had your own boat. And no more boat rental fees or hassle.\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B, who values following their passions for snowboarding and music, expresses interest in trying water skiing next. Speaker A, who has been water skiing for 15 years and has 3 kids who also water ski, is excited to join Speaker B's family for a water skiing trip and wants to learn from Speaker A's kids.",
