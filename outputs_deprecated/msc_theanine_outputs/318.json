Do you build computers or work on programming?\nSpeaker B: I do like my job. My job is to troubleshoot issues between the hardware and software, so I get to work with both.\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A enjoys reading books about ice cream, Disney World, and computers, which causes Speaker A to be open to meeting for lunch and be flexible with food choices. \nSpeaker B works for a computer company and is unable to change careers until their child graduates, hindering Speaker B's plans to take their child to Disney World. Speaker A is considering a career in dentistry but is also interested in working at Disney for happiness. \nSpeaker A, who works for a small local business with a demanding schedule, reacts by not having children and spending time working and reading, preferring late morning for a meeting.",
