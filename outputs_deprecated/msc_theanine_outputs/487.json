In addition, Speaker A plans to leave a hammock by the river for anyone to use at a hidden spot off the main hiking trail. This plan changed as Speaker A now has a portable hammock for the hike and asks if Speaker B will bring theirs.\n\nSpeaker B, who does not vote, wants their neighbor John to know about their stance on group equality. This desire is caused by the fact that Speaker B's neighbor, John, is getting divorced and selling top-of-the-line camping gear. Additionally, Speaker B's friend worked at the same store and enjoyed the people there.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY contains past information about Speaker A's journey, the hammock and camping trip. The dialogue context is about a job offer they received from a grocery store which doesn't correlate with the information from the MEMORY. Thus, the MEMORY doesn't contain helpful information to come up with a proper response.\nJudgement: \"No\""
