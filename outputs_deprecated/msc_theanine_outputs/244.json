I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me.\nSpeaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway?\nSpeaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day! I'll make it as fun as possible.\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks. This includes camping and hiking as free activities, which Speaker B is not into as much, preferring cruises. Speaker A recently led friends on a hike and enjoyed it, while Speaker B went on a long hike and liked it. Speaker A is looking forward to a 10-day hike on the Appalachian Trail.",
