Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\nSpeaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach?\nSpeaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option.\nSpeaker A: Yes I think history is interesting, too! Both of those subjects would be great because there are probably lots of teaching jobs. What kind of history do you like?\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job. This has led Speaker A to be interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics. \nSpeaker B is majoring in linguistics and hopes to turn it into a practical job. This has led Speaker B to consider getting a masters degree after completing their bachelors and potentially becoming a college professor in linguistics. This decision has made Speaker B feel limited in job opportunities.",
