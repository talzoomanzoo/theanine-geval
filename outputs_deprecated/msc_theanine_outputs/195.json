Can you make it? What kinds of spicy foods have you taught yourself to make?\nSpeaker B: Yes, it's one of my favorites! It always remind me of the good old days. Spicy foods are great for the kick they have...like spicy fried rice! You should come over and try it.\nSpeaker A: I would love to, I enjoy cooking so maybe you can teach me to make it, too?\nSpeaker B: Yeah definitely! I know you like hot foods, so if you learn and can make them fresh it will taste amazing. Have you tried any new foods lately?\nSpeaker A: Not any new foods, but I did try a new food truck near me that was delicious! It was street tacos and you could pick from barbacoa, chicken, and steak for the protein. Do you like Mexican food? \nSpeaker B: Oh god I do love Mexican food. That was be so hard to pick because they're all so good! Did they have al pastor by any chance? I loved marinated pork tacos.\nSpeaker A: unfortunately no, but I can ask them if they plan to get it in the future. I had one of each and they were all good in their own way. Have you ever had Birra tacos? I'd love to try those next.\nSpeaker B: I've never had birra tacos, what are those? They sound intriguing.\nSpeaker A: If I understand it correctly, the tortilla is dipped in the liquid from the braised meat, and then fried on a flat top. Then filled with the meat that was braised and other toppings that you like. I'll let you know if I find a place that serves these tacos in our area!\nSpeaker B: Wow, my mouth is watering. I'll definitely have to try that. It sounds amazing and might be a new favorite. Is it spicy?\nSpeaker A: I'm not sure, but if I had to guess I'd say a little at least. Do you enjoy spicy food?\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A wakes up early in the morning to catch waves, while Speaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe.\nSpeaker B enjoys cooking for loved ones and values their grandmother's garlic chicken recipe, which reminds them of the good old days.",
