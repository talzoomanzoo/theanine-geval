How are the little furries doing?\nSpeaker B: They are doing well. I think I am going to paint a portrait of my great dane standing next to my pet rat lol. Do you know where you want to get your new cat from?\nSpeaker A: Someone I work with at the dog daycare works at a shelter.  I think I will go there.\nSpeaker B: That's great. I have gotten my pets from the shelter and they seem happy I brought them home. I have a hard time saying no to them which is why I have so many pets. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs. Do you have a name in mind for your cat? \n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A's brother might commission a family portrait from Speaker B, who has 5 dogs of different breeds and rats as pets but didn't include them in the portrait. Speaker B's prices for a portrait start at $5000 to pay for college tuition, and they are in college, paint on the side, and have five dogs and three rats. Speaker B thinks pit bulls are lovely and has one that is kind and sweet, and likes Persian cats, imagining their pets having interesting interactions. Speaker A is considering getting kittens and thinks rats can be smart. Speaker B is busy with school and taking care of their five dogs, so working at a doggy daycare would be too much, as they are working on other portraits and taking care of a sick dog.",
