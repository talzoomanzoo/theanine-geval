Teaching is probably a good idea since it is a more guaranteed job.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I did talk to my advisor and it was very stressful. Deciding my whole life when I am really unsure! But I think I will get into teaching, it is a stable career.\nSpeaker A: It sounds like something that you would really like and be good at! I hope it works out. I would love to teach robotics someday.\nSpeaker B: That is so cool, you must be really smart! I imagine your parents are so proud.\nSpeaker A: Well I'm studying computer science and learning a lot! My parents are great, they are very supportive. What subject would you want to teach?\nSpeaker B: I would probably teach English, just because that is most in line with what I am studying. However, I have recently started becoming more interested in history so that is also an option.\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B wants to turn their linguistics major into a practical job, while Speaker A wants to develop apps for differently abled youth through studying computer science. Speaker A is interested in teaching computer science, specifically in the field of robotics. \nSpeaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college and studying computer science, while Speaker B is considering further education to become a college professor in linguistics, feeling limited in job opportunities.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The information from memory can be referenced to add more depth to the conversation, especially regarding the ambitions of speaker A and B. The memory does not only mention their career interests that correlate to their college major, Speaker A: Computer Science and Speaker B: English or History, but also provides some extra information about them like how Speaker A is working at a pizza shop to pay for college which could be woven in future responses carefully to feel more personalized.\nJudgement: Yes"
