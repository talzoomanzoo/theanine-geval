    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory does not contain helpful past information for Language model to use to generate a proper next response. The dialogue context involves a discussion about camping, visiting zoos and future plans for the weekend, while the memory revolves around Speaker A's visits to the zoo to see tigers and monkeys, Speaker's B daughter's love for monkeys, Speaker A's love for seeing the tiger called Joshua and Speaker B advocating for their daughter's school to organize a trip to the zoo. The information in the memory is generally related, but it can't help in generating a proper next response to Speaker A's question about B's plans for the next weekend.\nJudgement: No"
