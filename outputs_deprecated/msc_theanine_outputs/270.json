It's almost finals season. I'm still studying for them but I think it'll be ok. How about your history exam?\nSpeaker A: The history exam went pretty well, I got a B. I think that if I would have studied more, I would have got an A.\nSpeaker B: A B is still pretty great though! Do you have more exams coming up or are you on a break now?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I guess I am happy considering I did not have the best History teacher. I have one more final in a few days, then I am done. \nSpeaker B: Exactly, it's hard to get good grades when you don't have the best teachers. What subject is your next final on?\nSpeaker A: My last final is on English. I think I will do well, I just have to do a little more studying. Would you be willing to help me study?\nSpeaker B: Ah, English should be easier than History. Sure, I can help you. What do you need to do exactly? Write an essay?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, we have to write an essay and we have a spelling component towards the end of the exam, I sure could use a little help!\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B is studying sports medicine in college, while Speaker A struggles with history class and finds it boring. Speaker B feels overwhelmed by their mother's strictness and looks forward to finishing school to escape it.\nSpeaker A believes that sports demonstrate how everyone can work together equally. Speaker B, who is training in sports medicine, feels pressured to maintain straight A's to avoid embarrassing their mother, who is in charge of the school.\nSpeaker B plays soccer and is an only child, while Speaker A hopes to improve their grades and aims for a soccer scholarship. Speaker B realizes the necessity of discussing the pressure they face with their mother.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory does not contain any helpful information for the next response since the dialogue context is about English exams and studying together. The memory mainly talks about Speaker A's soccer aspirations and Speaker B's pressure to maintain straight A's and issues with their mother. None of these memory entries aids in continuing the conversation about studying for the English final exam.\nJudgement: No"
