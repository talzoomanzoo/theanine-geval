Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\nSpeaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise? \nSpeaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows.\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A, a recent high school graduate on a cross-country journey, is eager to visit the Columbia Trail and Ken Lockwood Gorge for a camping and hiking trip. Additionally, Speaker A applied for a job at a grocery store near a hiking trail. Speaker A also plans to leave a hammock by the river for fellow hikers to use at a hidden spot off the main hiking trail and suggests bringing water for the hike, mentioning a picnic at the mountain top.",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great idea! Being a park guide could be really fulfilling. You should definitely look into that more.",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The information in MEMORY about Speaker A's love for hiking and camping as well as their plans to visit specific trails could potentially provide context to the conversation about career choices. For instance, if Speaker B were to offer more detail about their career interests, it could lead Speaker A to suggest a career related to their shared interest in the outdoors. Even though it's not explicitly necessary for a response, it could enhance the conversation.\nJudgement: Yes"
