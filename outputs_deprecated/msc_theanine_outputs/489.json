Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\nSpeaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A, a recent high school graduate on a cross-country journey looking for jobs, wants to potentially visit the Columbia Trail and Ken Lockwood Gorge for a camping and hiking trip. They also applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail. As a result, Speaker A plans to leave a hammock by the river for anyone to use at a hidden spot off the main hiking trail, and now has a portable hammock for the hike, asking Speaker B to bring theirs.",
