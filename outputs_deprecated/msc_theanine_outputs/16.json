It's all punk music, but I have an hour of fun music for the pool and more steady music for our programming studies. It's going to be fun!\nSpeaker B: That sounds great to me.  Hope I'm able to learn to swim. \nSpeaker A: I can teach you! I have taught quite a few people so I'll help you \nSpeaker B: I would really appreciate that. Maybe I could go on one of your next cruises.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that would be great. I'm excited about going to the Carribean. I've never been. Have you?\nSpeaker B: No, I have not.  I've not been outside the US, but would love to go .Let me know how you like it.\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B, who does not know how to swim but enjoys watching swimming movies, reacted positively when Speaker A offered to teach them how to swim and programming. Speaker A's plan to do snorkeling and other activities at their cruise destination changed as they signed up for several trips. This led to Speaker A planning a snorkeling trip and looking forward to traveling to the Caribbean for their next trip. Additionally, Speaker B expressed their enjoyment of cruising in their car while listening to punk music, which sparked a conversation about the potential of Speaker A and Speaker B getting on a cruise ship together.",
