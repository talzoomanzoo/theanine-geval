I have searched online a lot for internships but it is tricky in my field.  What do you do for a living in the medical field?\nSpeaker A: You are so welcome. I am retired now but I was a PA- physician assistant. Now I enjoy hanging out at the beach. With my knees the way they are the ocean water seems to make them feel better. So how much longer before you graduate?\nSpeaker B: I have another year- so this year is really important I get internships and start making connections in the field.   I love going to the beach too.  What happened with your knees that now cause you so much pain?\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A mentioning their neighbor John, who loves soccer, leads Speaker B to study sports medicine, play soccer, and aim to join their college team. This interest causes Speaker B to seek internships in sports medicine and enjoy surfing instead. Speaker B's professors being supportive in writing letters for an internship application causes Speaker A to offer advice and encouragement to Speaker B regarding the internship hunt, mentioning the medical field. Speaker B, as a college student playing soccer with peers, transitions to looking for internships in sports medicine, asking professors for letters of recommendation. This change results in Speaker B struggling to find internships and feeling disadvantaged compared to those with connections.",

    "raw_prediction": "I had a few injuries from playing sports when I was younger, and they just caught up with me over the years. It's great that you're focused on internships and making connections in your field. Keep pushing forward, it will pay off in the long run!",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY is useful because it provides background information about Speaker B's interest in sports medicine, their need for internships in sports medicine, and why they would appreciate the connections shared by Speaker A (i.e., Speaker B feels disadvantaged in finding internships). It also validates Speaker B's enjoyment of beach activities (e.g., surfing) aligning with Speaker A's interest in the beach. \nJudgement: Yes"
