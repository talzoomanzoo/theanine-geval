    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY provides information about Speaker B's interest in zoo trips and their parental role, as well as their queries about leaving a kitten alone during camping trips. However, the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is relevant to a recent trip, presumably a camping trip that already took place and Speaker B's daughter's experience. Hence, the MEMORY does not contain information useful for Speaker A to continue the conversation smoothly.\nJudgement: No"
