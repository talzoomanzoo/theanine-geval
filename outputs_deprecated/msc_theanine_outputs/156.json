My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to?\nSpeaker A: I recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca. It was super cute and made me want to go visit Italy, but that was too expensive, so instead I booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month.

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The DIALOGUE CONTEXT shows Speaker A and Speaker B discussing the movies they watched. Speaker B's enjoyment of Disney movies and the fact that she recommended 'Miracle' to Speaker A are already known to Speaker A based on their conversation, and Speaker A doesn't ask anything about Speaker B's preferences directly. Therefore, the information from MEMORY is not needed for Speaker B to response properly.\nJudgement: \"No\""
