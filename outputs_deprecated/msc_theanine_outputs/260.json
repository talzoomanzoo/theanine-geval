Either making movies or interior design, or is their another creative outlet that appeals to you?\nSpeaker B: I have been working producing horror movies and I really like it!  It is a lot more enjoyable than my day job.  Not sure that interior design is a good fit.  I just am good at painting houses.\nSpeaker A: The process of making horror movies must be fascinating.  Do you have any interesting stories from the set?\nSpeaker B: Oh yeah.  One time a makeup artist was applying fake blood all over a scene.  They had this all over their hands.  While they were spreading this blood around they cut a finger pretty bad.  They had no idea they had done this until they went to clean up.\nSpeaker A: That sounds gross.  By the way, what is movie blood made out of anyway?  Do you know or do you have a favorite blood recipe?\nSpeaker B: There is some weird chemical mix that I really do not mess with.  It is easy to clean up.  I try to stay away from this part of the movies.  I know what it should look like and that we want to keep everyone safe when using the fake blood.\nSpeaker A: Chemicals!  Do the actors hate working with it then?  I can imagine they are a pretty high maintenance bunch.  Do they worry about the blood messing with their looks?\nSpeaker B: Our actors are pretty amateur.  No big name ones so they are really good to work with.  Hey, how about you?  How is your interview practice going?  I am pretty sure you be excellent during it!\nSpeaker A: I think this discussion is helping me with making small talk, so thanks.  I just have to try and remember who i am and try to sell my good points.\nSpeaker B: That is a good approach.  I suppose you have been doing research on the company you are interviewing with?  I find it always helps to know the company as best you can for an interview.\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A recently moved to a new city and has two older brothers. This experience has made job searching challenging, but Speaker A is excited about the upcoming interview and hopes to settle in the new city soon with a steady income.",

The dialogue context focuses largely on Speaker B's experiences working in horror movies and the ongoing discussion related to it. In contrast, the MEMORY information is about Speaker A's recent move, two older brothers, and a job search in a new city, which are not relevant to the current conversation.\nJudgement: \"No\""
