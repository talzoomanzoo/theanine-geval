Where did you go on your walk?\nSpeaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous.\nSpeaker B: That sounds amazing! Did you bring a pet? I love doing the harder trails with my dog. Sometimes, it's very peaceful to get away from everything.\nSpeaker A: No, I don't have any pets; my apartment seems too small for a dog and I would worry about them being lonely all day when I'm at work. I was thinking about getting a pair of cats, but I haven't committed yet. How nice fo ryou to have company when you're walking though! What kind of dog do you have?\nSpeaker B: Cats can be nice! I used to have cats, but am allergic to them and had to give them to my friend. I have an Australian Kelpie who is a rescue. She is very energetic and smart!\nSpeaker A: I had cats as a child and I think that they're a bit easier to care for than dogs, especially in the city. I am a dog lover as well though; Australian Kelpies are gorgeous! What is her name? Does she walk well off-leash?\nSpeaker B: Yes, cats are very smart and clean. Mine used to bring me a mouse to throw for her, just like a dog! And if you have 2 cats, they play with each other! Mine would run up and down the halls in the middle of the night, haha. Her name is Kyrie, and she walks off leash and is very obedient. Dogs might be hard to keep in your small apartment though, since Kyrie likes to play in the field, run with cars along the fence row, and herd goats. \nSpeaker A: Oh wow! So Kyrie is a working dog? She helps your dad out on the farm?\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B loves nature and works with animals, currently re-reading 'Redwall' by Brian Jacques, which was a favorite book growing up. Speaker B has been busy with a new painting and has not had time to read, and Speaker A asks about Speaker B's new artwork and acknowledges their need for inspiration.\nSpeaker B is an artist who walks through nature for work and is interested in Pilates but dislikes the idea of having to follow specific steps in exercise.\nSpeaker A walks to work instead of driving, practices Pilates, and finds it great for beginners.",
