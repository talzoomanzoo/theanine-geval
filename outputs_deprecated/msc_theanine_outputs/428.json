One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha!\nSpeaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes?\nSpeaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe. \nSpeaker A: You make them sounds so fascinating. Will you take them with you to your college dorm? \nSpeaker B: I'll be living off campus, so absolutely. How about you? Are you staying in the dorms?\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A is interested in scuba diving because Speaker B loves to scuba dive in Hawaii when not working. This interest is further fueled by Speaker A's friend who is a professional scuba diver and plans to go diving with them. Speaker A also plans to work with humans in neuroscience to help cure neurological diseases, and once Speaker B finishes their studies, Speaker A intends to compare humans and animals.",
