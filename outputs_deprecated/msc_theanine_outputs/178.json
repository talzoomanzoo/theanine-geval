Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know. \nSpeaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like.\nSpeaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too.\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A enjoys Mexican food and drinks, and plays music for fun. This interest leads to Speaker A frequenting live band venues and playing music at home. The topic of music is also shared with Speaker B, as both Speaker A and Speaker B enjoy bluegrass music.\n\nSpeaker A owns a Subaru Legacy and mentions having a baby on the way, causing Speaker B's wife to be pregnant and currently in the second trimester while still working. Due to the pregnancy, Speaker B's wife is considering attending a local festival for just a day. This topic of family planning is further explored when Speaker A expresses uncertainty about settling down with a partner and having kids.\n\nEven though Speaker A does not live in Mexico, they enjoy Mexican food and women. This preference contrasts with Speaker B, who is not going out drinking much due to their wife's pregnancy. Both Speaker A and Speaker B, however, engage in discussions about the logistics of attending a festival with a small baby.",
