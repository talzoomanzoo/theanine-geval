Where are you going on vacation?\nSpeaker B: Next Thursday, we're going to San Diego. I can't wait to visit the zoo there!\nSpeaker A: Nice! Have you ever been there before?  How good is their zoo?\nSpeaker B: Their zoo is pretty good! It's always crowded, of course, but they have pandas so I'm happy. I would say it's bigger than the DC zoo, but I like that the DC zoo has fewer people.\nSpeaker A: That sounds awesome.  I haven't been to the zoo in so long.  I wish I could go.\nSpeaker B: You should go with your sister! she can bring her dog. They probably have all kinds of exotic birds...\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A and Speaker B enjoy visiting the zoo and discussing hobbies and interests.

Speaker A prefers cockatoos over kittens as pets. \nSpeaker A's sister recently got married, which was exciting for them. Speaker A enjoys pandas and penguins at the zoo and goes with their sister. This caused Speaker A's sister to become a dog person with a yellow lab. Speaker B is willing to be a cool uncle to his sister's future children but does not want kids of his own. \nSpeaker B, who has a cat that recently had a kitten, also enjoys visiting the zoo.
