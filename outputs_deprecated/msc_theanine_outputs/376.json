How good is their zoo?\nSpeaker B: Their zoo is pretty good! It's always crowded, of course, but they have pandas so I'm happy.

I wish I could go.\nSpeaker B: You should go with your sister! she can bring her dog. They probably have all kinds of exotic birds...\nSpeaker A: That's a great idea!

    "raw_prediction": "Maybe your sister's dog just needs a little socialization. It could be a fun adventure for all of you!",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory contains some relevant information such as Speaker B's girlfriend's enjoyment of pandas and penguins at the zoo, and the fact that Speaker B is considering adopting a kitten. However, much of the information regarding Speaker A's sister and their dog is different than what has been mentioned in the conversation. For instance, the dialogue states that Speaker A's sister has a dog that barks a lot, but the memory talks about a corgi. Although, the information about adopting a kitten is congruent which might assist the model in continuing the conversation. \nJudgement: \"Yes\""
