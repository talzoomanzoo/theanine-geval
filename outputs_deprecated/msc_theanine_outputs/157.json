My kids love pretty much every Disney movie but my husband loved it, too. What else have you been up to?\nSpeaker A: I recently went to watch that new Disney movie, Luca. It was super cute and made me want to go visit Italy, but that was too expensive, so instead I booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month. What about you?\nSpeaker B: I have been relaxing with the kids as much as I have. My husband has been busy with work, so we haven't had time for anything big. I would love to visit Italy some day though if we get the chance. Have you ever been to Italy before?\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A has seen the Disney movie 'Luca' recently, which made them want to go visit Italy, but instead, they booked a Hawaii sunset tour for next month.\nSpeaker B's kids enjoy watching Disney movies, which Speaker B also finds good.

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory provides some past information about Speaker A's and Speaker B's experiences with watching movies, which isn't particularly useful in this context. The dialogue context is more focused on travels and future plans interpreted from their recent movie viewings than their opinion on movies. The only relevant information from memory, such as Speaker A plans to go on a Hawaii sunset tour next month as an alternative to visiting Italy, is already mentioned in the dialogue context.\nJudgement: No"
