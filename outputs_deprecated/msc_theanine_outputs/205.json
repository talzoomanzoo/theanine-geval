Do you miss it?\nSpeaker B: I do a bit, but I can relive those times by watching games on TV these days. \nSpeaker A: That is a good point. I have been thinking that I want to be a voice on one of those soccer video games for a living.\nSpeaker B: That would be a dream job! Maybe I should get back into playing for real, It's good exercise. Could I join one of your games sometime?\nSpeaker A: Probably not an actual game, but I can reserve some time on the field. Maybe I can get some other friends to join so we can really play.\nSpeaker B: That sounds good, I haven't played in a while so something more casual would probably be best to start with.\nSpeaker A: Sounds great! Now the tough question: when do you have time?\nSpeaker B: It would have to be sometime when I'm off work, maybe on the weekend. \n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A used to work part-time at a supermarket and is a member of a soccer team, enjoying playing in tournaments. \nSpeaker A played intramural soccer in college and is a fan of Manchester United. \nSpeaker A plays soccer as a striker and has a match next week, being a fan of Arsenal and enjoying watching international teams play.",
