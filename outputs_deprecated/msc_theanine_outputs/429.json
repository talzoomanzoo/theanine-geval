One of my favorite things about Hensel and Gretel is the fact they're low maintenance. Ha!\nSpeaker A: Apart from being low maintenance; what do you like about having snakes?\nSpeaker B: I've always been a reptile fan. Guess it's the science nerd in me. The way the look, the way their bodies work, their temperment...they're just cool to observe. \nSpeaker A: You make them sounds so fascinating. Will you take them with you to your college dorm? \nSpeaker B: I'll be living off campus, so absolutely. How about you? Are you staying in the dorms?\nSpeaker A: I'm glad your taking them with you. My mum wants me to stay in dorms. But I think I just want my own place, less drama and more freedom that way.\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A is a student planning to go to college next year and wants to study neuroscience. Speaker B mentions studying Neuroscience classes next year, hinting at being a student. Speaker A plans to work with humans in neuroscience to help cure neurological diseases. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies. \nSpeaker A is working on becoming an Eagle Scout and volunteers at a research lab. Speaker B mentions studying Neuroscience classes next year, hinting at being a student. Speaker B is excited about taking neuroscience classes next year. Speaker B's classes related to neuroscience will start next year. \nSpeaker B recently divorced their wife and loves to scuba dive in Hawaii when not working. Speaker B has two pet snakes named Hansel and Gretel. Speaker A finds it amusing that Speaker B prefers animals to humans. Speaker A is currently volunteering at a lab and plans to compare humans and animals once Speaker B finishes their studies.",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "raw_prediction": "Living off campus does sound like a great way to have your own space. Plus, you can have your snakes with you!",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory provides information about both speakers being students and their fields of interest, specifically that Speaker B will be taking Neuroscience classes next year and Speaker A currently volunteers at a lab. However, this information is not directly related to the dialogue context where they're discussing pet snakes and their lodging plans during college term. Therefore, the memory doesn't offer useful details for generating the next possible response.  \nJudgement: No"
