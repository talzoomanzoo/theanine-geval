If your husband likes Asian food I found a few recipes you may want to try. Most pressure cookers also make rice. \nSpeaker B: Oh my! Thank you so much for that. Which recipe do you think I should start with?\nSpeaker A: I think shrimp fried rice would be a good place to start.  It's simple and not a lot of ingredients. What do you think?\nSpeaker B: Does it have eggs in it? We grow our own eggs so that might be the perfect starting point.\nSpeaker A: Yes, it contains eggs.  I think you would do well with the fried rice. It's best to cook the rice the day before.  \nSpeaker B: I didn't know that. Why cook the rice beforehand? Is it better to age rice or something?\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B lives in a rural area with a farm and can relate to cooking. Speaker A enjoys cooking and baking, possibly considering turning it into a business. Speaker B is not a cook but is interested in learning about cooking with a pressure cooker.\nSpeaker A enjoys cooking and baking, possibly considering turning it into a business. Speaker B's husband is a great cook and Speaker B is not skilled in cooking. Speaker A primarily cooks Indian food and bakes a lot of rice dishes.
