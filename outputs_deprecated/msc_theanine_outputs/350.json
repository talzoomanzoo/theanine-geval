Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar.\nSpeaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general?\nSpeaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts.\nSpeaker A: How's learning to bake going in general, especially now that you're off desserts?\n\n[MEMORY]\n1. Speaker A's strong connection to jello, especially cherry flavor, stems from their grandma making it at family dinners, leading to Speaker A learning various jello recipes from their grandmother.\n2. Speaker A's favorite jello eating habit transformed into a family tradition after learning how to make jello from their grandma, suggesting Speaker B to involve their grandmother in learning jello recipes.\n3. Speaker A's upbringing by two non-meat eater moms shifted into a family tradition of learning jello recipes from their grandma.",
