What do you think?\nSpeaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons\nSpeaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use.\nSpeaker B: I am a little scared of needles though. Were your tattoos painful?\nSpeaker A: Most of them were not.  It really depends on where on your body you get them.  Most of mine are on areas that didn't hurt.  The one on my foot and the one behind my ear did hurt a good bit.  Where were you thinking about getting it?\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A has a total of 5 tattoos and enjoys getting them, with one dedicated to their late father. They plan to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan already tattooed on their chest. Speaker A's favorite tattoo is the one dedicated to their late father, with the phrase \"for you I shall live\". They are working at a coffee shop to save up for their next tattoo, which will be the portrait of their father's face next to the existing slogan.",
