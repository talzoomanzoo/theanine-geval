That's really exciting!\nSpeaker B: I really want to. If classes are too hard though, I will have to quit. I will still keep in touch with them! Would you eat a hamburger from a cloned cow?\nSpeaker A: Awww, don't quit if classes get too hard.  You seem like a really intelligent person. Honestly, I wouldn't knowingly eat a hamburger from a cloned cow, but I'm sure at some point we won't know the real source of where our beef is coming from.\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A is a high school student planning to go to college, achieving straight A's. Speaker A wants Speaker B to continue working in the lab and school instead of giving up their night job. Speaker B is also a high school student preparing for college, working at a diner at night. Speaker B had hamburgers for dinner with cheese, mustard, and lettuce.",
