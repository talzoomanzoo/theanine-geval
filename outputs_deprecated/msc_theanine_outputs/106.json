My friend says they don't have 24 hour days like we do.\nSpeaker A: You mean they have different daylight and darkness times? That would be cool to see. If it's dark, I'm sure you could go camping somewhere and get some really great views of the stars.\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I think they go dark for a couple months and then have daylight for a couple months! I actually like night time, but having daylight all the time will make me crazy lol. Yeah I kind of hope it's dark for the camping but it will be very cold. I have heard Alaska has delicious ice cream. I want to try that while I'm there, \nSpeaker A: You'd have to get some serious blackout curtains for when it was daylight lol! You'll have to stock up on some warm essentials before heading out. You definitely don't want to get stuck in a bad situation in the cold, especially if you're alone. I bet they have great ice cream! You'll have to tell me about it when you get back!\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I need to call my friend and find out what season they are in so I can pack accordingly. I will take pictures of the ice cream too so I can tell you about it. I wonder if there are a lot of bears there? I don't like bears either.\nSpeaker A: I'm pretty sure they have grizzlies up there. You better pack something to fend them off too just in case. I bet your friend knows everything you'd need to keep them away.\nSpeaker B: I will bring whatever they let me bring on the airplane, but I am really counting on my friend to help me out with the local customs lol. Do you know if Rocky and Bullwinkle were from Alaska? \n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B is planning an Alaskan vacation but has not planned much yet, so Speaker A mentions the outdoor activities they plan to do in Alaska, such as hiking. \nSpeaker B is going to Alaska for a vacation in two weeks and has some experience with flying on airplanes, and Speaker A is familiar with Alaska and outdoor activities like fishing and hiking. They are planning a trip to Alaska together.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY is not helpful for generating a next response because the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is talking about Speaker B visiting Alaska, dog sledding, camping, trying local ice cream, and their questions about local seasons and wildlife. On the other hand, the MEMORY refers to Speaker A and B planning a trip together and mentions their familiarity with outdoor activities like fishing and hiking - information not mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\nJudgement: No"
