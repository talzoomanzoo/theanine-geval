    "raw_prediction": "I would recommend starting with a simple and delicious recipe like a chicken curry or a vegetable stir-fry. It's a great way to get comfortable using the pressure cooker.",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory provides helpful information about both Speaker A's and Speaker B's cooking preferences and their backgrounds. Particularly, Speaker B's lack of cooking skills and her interest in learning to use a pressure cooker align with the dialogue context where Speaker A suggests beginner recipes. The information about Speaker A's preference for Indian food may guide Speaker A in suggesting recipes for Speaker B.\nJudgement: \"Yes\""
