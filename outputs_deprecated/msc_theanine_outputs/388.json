What do you think?\nSpeaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons\nSpeaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use.\nSpeaker B: I am a little scared of needles though. Were your tattoos painful?\nSpeaker A: Most of them were not.  It really depends on where on your body you get them.  Most of mine are on areas that didn't hurt.  The one on my foot and the one behind my ear did hurt a good bit.  Where were you thinking about getting it?\nSpeaker B: I hadn't really thought about it! Maybe upper arm or upper back? But I'm no tattoo expert. And I'd have to get permission from my wife first, LOL\nSpeaker A: Definitely talk to her first.  I had a friend that didn't talk to his wife and just came home with a tattoo one day.  It led to a huge fight - both about the money he spent and not discussing it with her.  He slept on my couch for over a week!\nSpeaker B: Oh no! Yeah, you don't want to spring something like that on your spouse. I don't think you mentioned before, are you married?\nSpeaker A: No.  I haven't found anyone that could deal with me or that I could deal with for more than a few months.  At this point, I have given up on the idea of getting married and want to focus on my artwork.\nSpeaker B: There's nothing wrong with being on your own. You've got to focus on meeting your own needs first. Have you done any interesting art/graffiti lately?\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A works at a coffee shop that their mom owned, which is why they plan to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.\nSpeaker A enjoys getting tattoos and has 5 so far, with one dedicated to their late father, and is saving up for their next tattoo at the coffee shop.\nSpeaker A's favorite tattoo is the one dedicated to their late father, saying \"for you I shall live\", and they plan to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan they already have tattooed on their chest.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY does not contain any information that may be relevant or helpful to the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The DIALOGUE CONTEXT centers around discussing tattoos for honoring parents, fear of pain from tattooing, and the importance of getting a spouse's agreement before getting a tattoo. Yet, the MEMORY only offers some facts about Speaker A's existing tattoos and their job at a coffee shop. It does not have any direct connection with the topics discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\nJudgement: No"
