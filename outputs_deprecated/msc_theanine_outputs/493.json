Not a ton of money, but I love the location of the store and everyone seems really nice. I'm excited! What have you been doing for work?\nSpeaker B: Well, I'm actually in between jobs right now. I have however been helping my neighbor John with some side projects to make some cash; to be honest, he pays more than if I had an actual job. lol\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that's not bad. And then it's under the table, so you don't have to pay the taxes on it, so that's a win when you don't have a lot of money coming in. Is there something you'd really like to do career-wise? \nSpeaker B: I was thinking maybe something to do with the park system, maybe like a guide or something like that. I'd like that, but realistically, who knows.\nSpeaker A: That sounds wonderful! You'd get to just be out in nature all day. Sounds like a great job, especially if you're a bit introverted like me. That's why hiking is my favorite -- a good solitary activity. \nSpeaker B: Yes, I agree. What kind of hours would this new job have?\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A, a recent high school graduate on a cross-country journey looking for jobs, is planning to potentially visit the Columbia Trail and Ken Lockwood Gorge for a camping and hiking trip. They also applied to work at a grocery store near a hiking trail with the intention of using the money earned to buy a hammock online. This hammock will be left by the river for anyone to use at a hidden spot off the main hiking trail, and Speaker A now has a portable hammock for the hike, wondering if Speaker B will bring theirs.",
