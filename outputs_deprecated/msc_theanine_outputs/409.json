Did you find the book sufficiently exciting? \nSpeaker A: Yes, it's a really intense crime drama!  I'm really loving it so far.\nSpeaker B: You always go for that scintillating fiction, you know it's a bit much for my tastes. \nSpeaker A: why don't you like books like that?\nSpeaker B: They're okay, but I like my animal books. Is there a movie made from the book you're reading?\nSpeaker A: Not yet.  I think Netflix is going to make it into a movie soon.  They might finally convince me to pay for a subscription haha.\nSpeaker B: Well if it's any good I know you'll be watching the whole thing.\nSpeaker A: you know it.  And I know that you would just fall asleep during it whether it's any good or not.\n\n[MEMORY]\n1. Speaker A's energetic grandchildren have grown old enough to entertain themselves with technology or TV, allowing Speaker A to suggest taking naps during quiet times and mentioning watching her grandkids.\n2. After running out of things to watch, Speaker A, tired from spending time with their energetic grandchildren, turns to Netflix shows rated over 3.5 stars.\n3. Speaker A, with 8 grandchildren, finds solace in reading books and watching Netflix, suggesting taking naps during quiet times and mentioning watching her grandkids.",
