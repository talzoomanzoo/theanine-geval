Do you and your wife want to stay there so you can make it? Might be a more comfortable way for your wife to camp. Let me know. \nSpeaker B: That would be lovely! We can totally pay your friend to use the cabin if they would like.\nSpeaker A: I will let them my friend know that you are interested.  I think I might head out that way myself and camp out for the festival too.\nSpeaker B: Nice! Is anyone coming with you?\nSpeaker A: Just my doggy Drunky.  You never know,  I might meet a nice lady out there. \nSpeaker B: Totally.  There will be a bunch of women there and it'll be easy to strike up conversations.  Just be confident and I'm sure you could walk away with a bunch of numbers.\n\n[MEMORY]\n1. Speaker B is a mechanic who enjoys working on cars, while Speaker A frequents live band venues, plays music at home, and both enjoy bluegrass music.\n2. Speaker A owns a Subaru Legacy and mentions having a baby on the way, causing Speaker B to not go out drinking much due to their wife's pregnancy. As a result, Speaker B's wife is pregnant, so they are considering attending a local festival for just a day, which is a topic where Speaker A is not sure if they will ever settle down with a partner and have kids.\n3. Speaker A does not live in Mexico but likes Mexican food and women, which changed to enjoying going to bars and loving the ladies. Speaker B, on the other hand, dislikes public transportation and enjoys going to festivals but misses doing so.",
