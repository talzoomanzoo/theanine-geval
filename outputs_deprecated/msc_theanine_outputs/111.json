They just added one of my favorite dishes to the menu at work. I can't wait for my next shift so I can try it for free. I will send you a pic later, ok? \nSpeaker B: Okay, yes, please send me a pic as soon as you can. I can't wait to see it. What is the name of the dish?\n\n[MEMORY]\n1. Speaker A enjoys working at the restaurant despite the busy schedule, which causes Speaker A to enjoy the interaction with people at work and the variety of experiences that come with it.\n\n2. Speaker A owns a restaurant and recently experienced a fire incident but managed to put it out, leading to Speaker A finding it very busy working there. Additionally, Speaker A works at the restaurant and gets two free meals per week, along with taking home leftover baked goods.\n\n3. Speaker A's restaurant plays a mix of songs, mainly easy listening, to create a relaxing environment for diners, which is why Speaker A's schedule at the restaurant includes working doubles on Saturdays and 8-hour shifts on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.",
