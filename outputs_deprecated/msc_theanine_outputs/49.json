Do you enjoy it still? I think it would be really hard to listen to people and say the right thing.\nSpeaker B: Yeah I still love it, it can sometimes be challenging but when you see the impact you can make on some peoples' life it is soo rewarding! Have you ever done therapy?  \nSpeaker A: No, but I probably should. My husband suggested it because I have some \"unresolved childhood trauma' or whatever. I find therapy in riding my horses... but it would probably be good to talk to someone.\nSpeaker B: Well, I have recently just had a client leave after successfully completing his journey so if you wanted I would be very happy to see you?\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B's interest in becoming a therapist stemmed from their mom being a nurse and busy with work. This led Speaker B to discuss the profession's ups and downs, including the concern about the cost of owning horses and considering the psychological aspects of horse ownership in relation to Freudian theories.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY is not helpful in generating a possible response from Speaker A in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memory does describe why Speaker B has chosen to become a therapist and provides information that could potentially be of interest in a different context, but none of the details provided in the memory are relevant to Speaker A's current line of thinking about therapy, her unresolved childhood trauma, or her therapeutic relation with horse riding. \nJudgement: No"
