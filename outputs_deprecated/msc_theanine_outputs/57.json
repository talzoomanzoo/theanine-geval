Where did you go on your walk?\nSpeaker A: There is a river a few towns over, so I did the easy trail that follows along it. There is a harder trail that winds over some hills, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous.\n\n[MEMORY]\n- Speaker B, who lives in the country and loves nature, is currently re-reading 'Redwall' by Brian Jacques, a favorite book from their childhood. This has been hindered by their new painting project, which has been keeping them busy and away from reading. Speaker B prefers silence while reading and creating artwork to stay focused.",
