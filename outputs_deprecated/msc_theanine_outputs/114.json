    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY contains some contextual information about Speaker A, such as they work at a restaurant, they enjoy the interaction with people at work, and the variety of the job. However, none of this information is critical to Speaker B in constructing a solid response to Speaker A's last statement in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Therefore, the MEMORY is not helpful in this particular scenario.\nJudgement: \"No\""
