    "raw_prediction": "Don't worry, learning music takes time and patience. You'll find the right teacher eventually. Just keep practicing and you'll get there!",
    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory does not contain useful information for generating a response to the dialogue context. The memory primarily discusses Speaker A's band and writing music, and Speaker B's skill in fishing and writing. However, the dialogue context centers around Speaker B's interest in rock music and Speaker A's experience learning to play the drum. There is no information in the memory that could be used to enhance a response.\nJudgement: \"No\""
