    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory talks about Speaker A's current activities, interests and future goals, but Speaker A's inquiry about Speaker B is not about any of those topics. Speaker A simply asked if Speaker B misses playing soccer. Thus, the information in memory is not required or helpful to derive a response.\nJudgement: No"
