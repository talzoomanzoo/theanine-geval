    "prediction": "Brief explanation: While the memory provides background information about Speaker A's love for the zoo and Speaker B's caregiving responsibilities for their child and pets, this information is not directly relevant to the dialogue context. The dialogue is currently centered around camping, not zoos or pets, so the information in the memory is tangential.\nJudgement: \"No\""
