It is not easy, I understand.\nSpeaker B: Well thankfully I don't have that problem these days, I get to spend some great time with my grandkids. Have you thought any more about the idea of our annual fishing trip? \nSpeaker A: Yes, I think you should start planning this with your family and try and do different locations every year so that it changes up the scenery\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B has a lot of kids, all grown up now and with kids of their own. This causes Speaker A to have kids and be busy with work, unable to spend as much time with them as they would like. Speaker B, in turn, wants to spend time with their grandkids at the park, enjoying the idea of making the fishing trip an annual tradition to get the grandkids more interested in nature.\n\nSpeaker A, a librarian who loves kids, mentions having 3 children. This leads to Speaker A being busy with work and unable to spend as much time with their kids as they would like. Speaker B, who has grandkids and enjoys spending time with them at the park, took their grandkids fishing once, with mixed reactions from the kids.",
