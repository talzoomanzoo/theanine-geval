He is very cute, but not cuter than puppies!\nSpeaker B: Why do you like puppies so much?  What's so different about kittens and puppies?  Aren't they just both babies?  \nSpeaker A: Yes but puppies are just so cute with their beady eyes and always wagging their tails and following you everywhere!\nSpeaker B: You have a point.  It is nice to see puppies wagging their tail and just following you!  Changing topics, do you have any recipes with asparagus?  You know, it's such a popular vegetable, but I just don't know how to prepare it.\nSpeaker A: I don't have recipes but I know how to make a good grilled asparagus. Are you looking to bolster your chef book?\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B used to foster puppies but no longer does, while Speaker A is busy with work. Speaker A enjoys cooking, especially making fajitas, and also volunteers at animal shelters. \nSpeaker A is more interested in science than music, while Speaker B enjoys listening to Black Sabbath and grilling meat. They are excited about the idea of traveling the world and trying different cuisines, with Speaker A suggesting grilled asparagus with lemon. \nSpeaker A is an inventor working on a time machine and enjoys teleporting around the world. Speaker B is interested in trying different careers and is considering becoming a chef for Speaker A, who loves Mexican food and seafood.
