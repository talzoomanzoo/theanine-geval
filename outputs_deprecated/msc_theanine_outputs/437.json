Have you done any of that? I'm sure my kids would love roughing it.\nSpeaker B: Yes, it teaches a lot of survival skills and I would say social skills as well. You need to learn how to work together, and compromise. Yes, we often go camping and have to figure out a lot of things like how to start a fire or cook a meal with very little materials on hand. You should definitely get your kids into it.\nSpeaker A: Cool, thanks! Yes, that sounds wonderful, I think they would enjoy it a lot. What is your favorite part about camping?\nSpeaker B: I love being out in the wilderness and sleeping under the stars in the fresh air. It makes you realize how beautiful life is and how small we really are in comparison to the universe.\nSpeaker A: I miss doing that! I have done lots of picnics with my family but it's been a long time since I've slept in a tent! Looking forward to it again when the kids are older. Where was the last place you went?\nSpeaker B: We went up to an island in the middle of nowhere in Canada. There were lots of bears and huge moose!\nSpeaker A: Wow, that sounds like such an adventure! I love to visit Canada. I have seen moose but never a bear! That must have been scary!\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker B has been involved with Boy Scouts for 7-8 years, currently a Life Scout. Speaker A is involved in church activities and mentioned a church retreat. Speaker A appreciates Speaker B's involvement with the scout troop and invites them to a youth retreat. Speaker B plans to earn the Eagle Scout badge for college applications.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The memory contains speaker B's experiences with the Boy Scouts, which can be useful in the conversation as Speaker A and B are discussing about Boy Scouts, camping, and wilderness adventures. However, it does not directly answer the question posed by Speaker A in the dialogue context (\"That must have been scary!\").\nJudgement: Yes"
