What do you think?\nSpeaker B: That sounds like a great way to honor your parents. I don't have any tattoos myself, but I've thought about it. Maybe the names of my wife or sons\nSpeaker A: That is a great idea.  I would also add their birth dates as well.  You should take time to think about what font you would want to use.\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A is saving up for their next tattoo while working at a coffee shop that their mom owned, planning to get a portrait of their father's face next to a slogan already tattooed on their chest. Speaker A's favorite tattoo is dedicated to their late father, and they want to add another one with their father's portrait and a slogan.",
