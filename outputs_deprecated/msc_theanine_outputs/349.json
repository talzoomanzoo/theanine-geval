Its good to get kids interested in cooking early.  I may have to lay off for awhile because I am picking up so weight and I don't need the sugar.\nSpeaker A: Lay off what, jello, or desserts in general?\nSpeaker B: Honesty, both.  I started to watch baking how-to-video to learn to bake, and I am shocked at just how much sugar in in desserts.\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A has a strong connection to jello, particularly cherry flavor, due to their grandma making it at family dinners. This causes Speaker A to have a grandmother who teaches them various jello recipes. \nSpeaker A learned how to make jello from their grandma, turning it into a family tradition. Speaker A suggests that Speaker B can consider their grandmother as a surrogate grandma for learning jello recipes.",

    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The MEMORY doesn't contribute to Speaker A's potential response, which can be formulated solely relying on what has already been expressed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memory talks about Speaker A's personal experience and liking towards jello, which is not called for in the dialogue context.\nJudgement: \"N/A\""
