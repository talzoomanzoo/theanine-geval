I lead some friends on a hike in a local trail last weekend. They got tired really quickly as they never go hiking they told me.\nSpeaker B: Sounds like me. I am not a fan of the outdoors. Did your friends manage to have a good time anyway?\nSpeaker A: Oh they did. We had some nice snacks along the way. Oddly enough, we had some trail mix that someone had made at home. It was quite tasty. We also had some juice and water packed to make sure everyone stayed hydrated. You should join us one day! I'll make it as fun as possible.\nSpeaker B: I will someday. just not in the summer when all the bugs are out! Where do you go hiking the most?\n\n[MEMORY]\nSpeaker A enjoys going on camping trips and hiking trails in parks. Speaker B recently went on a long hike and enjoyed it, causing Speaker A to be nervous about the Appalachian Trail hike, as they don't usually do full day hikes.\nSpeaker A has never been on a cruise, but may consider trying one in the future. Speaker A enjoys camping and hiking as free activities, and also enjoys camping trips while looking for wild animals in the woods. Speaker B, on the other hand, dislikes bugs and is not a fan of camping, hiking, or the outdoors.",
