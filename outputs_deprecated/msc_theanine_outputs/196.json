    "prediction": "Brief explanation: The information in MEMORY indicates the position Speaker A currently plays in their soccer game. Since the DIALOGUE CONTEXT asks for information about 'when' they played soccer in college, there is possibility their position might have changed in the meantime. Therefore, even though it's related to soccer, it might not provide the exact information needed for Speaker B's response.\nJudgement: \"No\""
