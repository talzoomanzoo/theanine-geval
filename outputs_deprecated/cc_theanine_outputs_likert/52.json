Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today?\nCo-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing.\nCo-workers A: Do you need any help? I don't want you to get overwhelmed.\nCo-workers B: That's really nice of you, but I don't want to burden you with my work.\nCo-workers A: It's not a burden if it's something I can do to support you. Plus, helping you out makes me feel good too.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B is glad to have been able to help Co-worker A and feels the trade worked out well for both of them. Helping out makes Co-worker B feel good too.\n2. Co-worker A is grateful to Co-worker B for letting them borrow the horse and is having a great time riding her. Co-worker B is glad to have been able to help Co-worker A and feels the trade worked out well for both of them. They are looking forward to starting their partnership and are open to seeking extra help if needed.\n3. Co-worker B is supportive and glad that Co-worker A is okay. Co-worker A now has a good job and is doing well, despite their difficult upbringing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY includes sentences that hint at a positive relationship between the coworkers, such as their mutual support and willingness to help each other. However, most of the MEMORY content is not directly relevant or helpful for generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The mention of borrowing a horse and starting a partnership is unrelated to the current discussion about workload and offering help. Additionally, the MEMORY lacks clear connections or developments between the sentences, making it less useful for Co-worker B to craft a contextually appropriate response to Co-worker A. While some sentences imply a supportive relationship, they do not directly assist in responding to the immediate dialogue context."
