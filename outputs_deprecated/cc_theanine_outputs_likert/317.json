Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today?\nCo-workers B: No, you didn't. What did you do there?\nCo-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Co-worker B advises Co-worker A to be more disciplined and plan ahead for their actions. This leads to Co-worker B being supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable. In response, Co-worker B is aware of Co-worker A's struggles with late nights out and expensive Uber rides.\n- Both co-workers show a supportive and caring attitude towards each other, with Co-worker B being supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable. Consequently, Co-worker B is aware of Co-worker A's struggles with late nights out and expensive Uber rides.\n- Co-worker A has been getting written up for being late to work, which makes Co-worker A believe their success as a leader was due to determination and strength of character.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains sentences that provide some context on the relationship between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, and highlight their supportive interactions and Co-worker A's struggles. However, it does not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about the trip to the post office. The details about Co-worker A's personal challenges and Co-worker B's supportive nature do not offer information pertinent to the conversation at hand, which is focused on a day-to-day activity. Additionally, the sentences are somewhat repetitive, emphasizing Co-worker B's supportiveness, but without adding new insights. Therefore, while the MEMORY gives some background on Co-worker A and Co-worker B's relationship, it is not especially helpful for generating a relevant response in the given dialogue context."
