Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just visited this amazing new city. The architecture was stunning, the streets were so clean, and the people were very friendly.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like you had a great time! Which city did you visit?\nNeighbors A: It was Chicago. I had never been before, but it exceeded all my expectations.\nNeighbors B: I bet it was a nice change of scenery from our neighborhood.\nNeighbors A: Definitely. But you know, it's interesting how much our neighborhood has grown on me over the years. I remember when I first moved here, I was so unsure about it.\nNeighbors B: Yeah, I remember. But you stayed because you wanted to be here.\nNeighbors A: That's right. And since then, I've made so many great memories here. It's become my home.\nNeighbors B: And you're still spending time with God every day, right?\nNeighbors A: Yes, I am. It brings me so much peace and happiness.\nNeighbors B: That's really admirable. And speaking of power, I remember you telling me about that time when you could make me do anything you wanted.\nNeighbors A: Oh, gosh. That was so long ago. I can't even believe I had that kind of power over you.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A has been living in the same place for a long time and enjoys the neighborhood and people there. This has led to Neighbor A valuing the relationship with Neighbors B and considering them like family. In return, Neighbors B has been living in the neighborhood for some time, is supportive of Neighbors A, and acknowledges Neighbor A's friendly and outgoing nature.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It touches on the relationship between Neighbors A and B, highlighting how they value each other and consider themselves like family. This context can be useful for generating a response, as it provides insight into the familiarity and warmth between the speakers. However, the MEMORY could be more helpful if it included specific details or events that resonate directly with the dialogue, such as references to shared memories or moments of support mentioned in the conversation. The current MEMORY also lacks some context, like the reference to spending time with God or the humorous mention of power, which could have been included for a better understanding of the complexity of their relationship."
