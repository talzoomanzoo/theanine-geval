Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I can't believe how honored I am to be part of our class. I feel like we have something special going on here.\nClassmates B:  You're right. Our class definitely has a unique energy about it. What do you think sets us apart from other classes?\nClassmates A:  I think it's our sense of community. We all support each other and work together to achieve our goals.\nClassmates B:  That's definitely a big factor. And I also think our class has a lot of diversity, which brings new perspectives and ideas to the table.\nClassmates A:  Yes, absolutely. I love hearing everyone's different viewpoints and experiences. It really helps us all grow and learn.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B, after complimenting Classmates A on their suit and bringing up a past conversation about feelings, is planning to check their schedule to see when they can go to the mall together.\n2. Despite the rejection, Classmate A values their friendship with Classmate B, who appreciates Classmate A's honesty about their feelings but does not feel the same way.\n3. Classmates B enjoys people watching at the mall and feels relieved that they can still be friends with Classmates A, leading both classmates to value their friendship and suggest helping each other find the right person in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's so true. I feel like we all benefit from the different backgrounds and ideas we bring to the table.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some background information about the friendship between Classmates A and B, which could be relevant to their current conversation about community and support within their class. However, the information is not directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about the class's energy, sense of community, and diversity. The connections between the sentences in MEMORY are somewhat loose and focus more on their personal relationship rather than their experiences or dynamics within the class setting. This makes it challenging for a language model to draw relevant cues from MEMORY to generate a proper next response in continuation of the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. More direct connections or shared experiences within the class context would increase the helpfulness score."
