Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B is supportive and interested in the evidence collected by Co-worker A. Co-worker B commends Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs. As a result, Co-worker A agrees to be more conscious of how they come across to others in the future, and emphasizes the importance of communication and setting expectations when dealing with challenging clients. \n\n2. Co-worker A believes their evidence is more compelling than the opposing side's evidence. Co-worker B commends Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs. Consequently, Co-worker A agrees to be more conscious of how they come across to others in the future, and stresses the importance of communication and setting expectations, drawing from their experience dealing with challenging clients.\n\n3. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument. Co-worker B commends Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs, prompting Co-worker A to be more conscious of how they present themselves to others in the future. Additionally, Co-worker A underlines the significance of communication and expectation setting based on their past encounters with difficult clients.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Public speaking can definitely be a powerful tool for communication and engagement. It's great that you find it enjoyable!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains information that has some connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically the emphasis on communication and presenting oneself, which are related to public speaking. However, the MEMORY primarily focuses on Co-worker A collecting evidence, self-awareness, and dealing with challenging clients, which does not directly address the topic of public speaking enjoyment or connecting with an audience. The MEMORY provides only indirect contextual cues for generating a response about public speaking. Additionally, the sentences across the MEMORY are repetitive, focusing on the same thematic elements without adding new dimensions that could further aid in the context of the dialogue. Due to its limited direct relevance and repetitive nature, the MEMORY receives a score of 2."
