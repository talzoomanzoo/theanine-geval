Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel really fulfilled as a leader and guide. Helping others gives me a sense of purpose.\nCo-workers B: I can see that. You always seem to know just what to do to make people feel better.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I've had a lot of practice over the years. It's just something that comes naturally to me.\nCo-workers B: Do you remember that time when you were led to a safe place by the commander? You must have felt pretty grateful for his guidance then.\nCo-workers A: Absolutely. It was a really tough time and I was so relieved to have someone show me the way. I try to pay it forward by being that kind of leader for others.\nCo-workers B: That's a great attitude to have. Speaking of leadership, do you think you would ever want to take on a higher position in the company?\nCo-workers A: I'm always open to new opportunities, but I don't want to do it just for the sake of having more power. If I could make a bigger difference in that role, then I would consider it.\n\nMEMORY:\n[Co-worker B offers encouragement and believes things will work out in the end.] - (React) - [Co-worker B values finding fulfillment in work, pursuing hobbies, making a difference in the world, and building relationships with others.]\n[Co-worker B offers encouragement and believes things will work out in the end.] - (Changed) - [Co-worker B emphasizes the importance of acknowledging privileges and using them to make the world a better place.]\n[Co-worker B offers encouragement and believes things will work out in the end.] - (React) - [Co-worker A had a positive experience with a commander who helped them feel safe.]\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's admirable that you prioritize making a difference over seeking power. Your genuine care for others really shines through in your leadership style.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information that can aid in generating a proper response for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The last memory entry mentioning Co-worker A's positive experience with a commander aligns with the current conversation where Co-worker A expresses gratitude for being guided to safety. This memory provides a basis for Co-worker B's comment on how Co-worker A must have felt grateful for guidance. However, the other memory entries about Co-worker B offering encouragement or valuing work and relationships are not directly applicable to the current context. While these entries are phrased clearly, they provide limited clues for the specific topics being discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, like leadership or aspirations within the company. Therefore, the MEMORY is moderately helpful but not entirely relevant to all parts of the ongoing conversation."
