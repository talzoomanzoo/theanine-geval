Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, how's it going?\nNeighbors B: Not bad, thanks. How about you?\nNeighbors A: Oh, I'm doing alright. I was just thinking about the old days when I had my rock band.\nNeighbors B: Really? You had a band?\nNeighbors A: Yeah, we were called \"The Neighbors A Band.\" We used to play live shows around the city.\nNeighbors B: That's awesome! What kind of music did you guys play?\nNeighbors A: We played rock music, mostly covers but we also wrote some of our own songs.\nNeighbors B: Have you ever thought about starting the band again?\nNeighbors A: Not really, it was just a fun hobby back then. Plus, I don't think I have the same energy as I did when I was younger.\nNeighbors B: That's understandable. Do you still play any instruments?\nNeighbors A: I have a guitar but I haven't played it in a while. Maybe I should start practicing again.\n\nMEMORY:\n- [Neighbor A's positive experience with chiropractic care sparks Neighbor B's interest in trying it out.]\n- [Neighbor A's recovery from back pain motivates Neighbor B to look forward to playing together again when Neighbor A feels better.]\n- [Neighbor A and Neighbor B share a mutual fondness for Neighbor A's dog and are excited to play with it again.]\n- [Neighbor A expresses gratitude for Neighbor B's support and friendship.]\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains sentences that are not directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context revolves around Neighbor A's past with a rock band and their musical experiences, whereas the MEMORY entries pertain to health, shared interest in a pet, and expressions of gratitude for friendship. While the MEMORY entries offer some insight into the relationship and interactions between Neighbor A and Neighbor B, none of the sentences provide context about the band, music, or related topics brought up in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. As such, the MEMORY does not offer helpful information for generating a response based on the current conversation. The sentences are naturally structured and provide some understanding of the neighbor's dynamic, earning a score of 2, but they lack direct relevance to the specific context of resurrecting a past hobby of playing in a band."
