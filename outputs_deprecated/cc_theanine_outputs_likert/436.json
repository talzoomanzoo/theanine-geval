Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Mentee, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, have you ever tried to imagine what it would be like to think like someone else?\nMentor: Yes, I have. It's a great way to better understand and empathize with others.\nMentee: That's exactly what I thought. I've been trying to imagine what personY is thinking lately. It's been helping me to understand their perspective a bit better.\nMentor: That's a great approach. Putting ourselves in someone else's shoes can help us see things from a different angle and see where they're coming from.\nMentee: Exactly. And it also helps me to be more compassionate towards them. I think it's important for us to be more understanding and supportive of each other, especially in difficult times.\nMentor: I agree completely. It's important to be kind and compassionate towards others, especially when they may be going through something challenging.\nMentee: And I think it's also important to remember that we all have different perspectives and experiences that shape our thoughts and actions.\nMentor: Absolutely. Keeping an open mind and being willing to listen to others can help us to learn from them and grow as individuals.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentee is taking the idea of teaching religion seriously and wants to make a positive impact on people's lives. This approach helps Mentee to be more compassionate towards others, as discussed with Mentor.\n   \n2. Mentor encourages Mentee to approach teaching religion with an open mind and heart. This resonates with Mentor's belief that teaching religion or spiritual beliefs can help people feel connected and live by values, which is why Mentor became a mentor to help others going through similar situations.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some details that could potentially be linked to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically in terms of being open-minded and compassionate, which are themes present in both the MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY is not directly relevant to the current conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is about understanding others' perspectives, rather than teaching religion. The sentences in MEMORY do not clearly demonstrate development or causality related to the ongoing dialogue, and the specific details about teaching religion seem out of focus with what's currently being discussed. The structure of the MEMORY does help hint at the mentee's inclination towards being compassionate by understanding others, but doesnâ€™t directly support the immediate next response that should follow the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Consequently, this lack of direct relevancy and clear connection lowers the score."
