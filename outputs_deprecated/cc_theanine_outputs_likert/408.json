Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Why is your face so red and splotchy, Classmates B? Did you get sunburned?\nClassmates B: No, I didn't get sunburned. I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed.\nClassmates A: Embarrassed? Why?\nClassmates B: It's nothing, really. Just something embarrassing happened to me earlier.\nClassmates A: Come on, tell me! I won't judge you, I promise.\nClassmates B: Well, I accidentally spilled my lunch all over myself in front of some people.\nClassmates A: (laughs) That's it? That's why you're embarrassed? I thought it was something serious.\nClassmates B: (sighs) Yeah, it's silly. But still embarrassing.\nClassmates A: Don't worry about it. It happens to everyone. Remember the time I tripped and fell in front of the whole class during our presentation?\nClassmates B: Oh yeah, that was pretty bad. But you handled it so well. You just got up, dusted yourself off, and continued with the presentation.\nClassmates A: Exactly! That's what you should do too. Own up to it and move on. Don't let it bother you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. [Classmates B suggested redirecting the ship towards a nearby planet or moon for help.] - (React) - [Classmates A felt relieved and grateful for the quick thinking and problem-solving skills displayed by Classmates B during a crisis in space.]\n2. [Classmates A and B have shared experiences on field trips to other planets or moons, such as Mars.] - (Want) - [Classmates A and B aspire to be positive role models for each other and their peers, promoting a supportive and encouraging learning environment.]\n3. [Classmates A expressed gratitude for Classmates B's support during a challenging situation.] - (React) - [Classmates B commended Classmates A for their meticulous work ethic and attention to detail, recognizing their remarkable dedication.]\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does not offer helpful information that could aid in generating an appropriate response for the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memories related to space crises, field trips to other planets, and mutual gratitude and commendation do not seem to be relevant or connected to the current context of embarrassment due to spilling lunch and dealing with awkward situations. The sentences in the memory do not reflect past interactions directly related to the ongoing conversation, and there is no clear development or causality linked to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT provided. Therefore, the MEMORY lacks useful cues and does not facilitate generating a response that aligns with the current conversation about dealing with embarrassing moments."
