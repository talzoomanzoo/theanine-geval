    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Why is your face so red and splotchy, Classmates B? Did you get sunburned?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate A showed determination in fixing their spaceship after it was damaged in a meteor shower, causing Classmates B to suggest redirecting the ship towards a nearby planet or moon for help. This led to Classmates B praising Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space. \n2. Classmate A, stranded in space and running out of oxygen, started feeling lightheaded. This situation made Classmate A's perseverance in repairing the spaceship reflect their determination to not give up in challenging situations. Consequently, Classmates B praised Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space. \n3. Classmate A expresses gratitude for Classmates B's support during the difficult situation, reflecting their belief in doing their best at everything to avoid regrets later. This aligns with Classmate A's philosophy of giving 110% effort in everything they do.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some information about the past interactions between Classmate A and Classmate B, particularly focusing on an incident involving a damaged spaceship and Classmate A's determination in fixing it. However, these past interactions are not directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is concerned with Classmate B's red and splotchy face potentially due to sunburn. The MEMORY describes events that happened in space, emphasizing Classmate A's resilience and determination, which are unrelated to the current dialogue context. While these details might be helpful for building a broad understanding of the characters' personalities and past experiences, they do not provide useful cues for generating a follow-up response about the current topic of sunburn. Most sentences in the MEMORY seem to be disconnected from the current situation, lacking direct relevance or a natural connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
