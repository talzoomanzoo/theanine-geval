Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: Child, I have a new project that I've been working on.\nChild: What is it, Parent?\nParent: I created a website where I post advertisements, and people can pay to see them.\nChild: Oh, that's interesting. How does it work?\nParent: Well, I create the ads myself, and then I post them on my website. People who want to view the ads can pay a small fee, and then they can see them.\nChild: Do you think people will pay to see your ads?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Child suggests creating a schedule for chores to ensure everyone contributes equally. The Parent expresses a desire to be a better role model for the Child and their siblings. The Child is caring and offers help to the Parent.\n\n2. The Parent agrees to make an effort to start pulling their weight around the house and to follow the chore schedule. The Parent expresses a desire to be a better role model for the Child and their siblings. The Child supports the idea of the Parent adopting more children and hopes for a happy home for them.\n\n3. The Child feels it is unfair that they have to do certain chores because the Parent is too tired. This causes the Parent to acknowledge being lazy about washing dishes and promises to contribute more to keeping the home clean. They have open communication about various topics, including a past accident and the parent's willingness to contribute more to household chores. The Parent has seen a doctor and is taking medicine for their illness.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does contain a series of interactions between Parent and Child, detailing their discussions around household chores and the Parent's efforts to be a better role model. However, this MEMORY is largely irrelevant for the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on the Parent's new project involving creating and displaying advertisements on a website. The MEMORY mainly describes past interactions regarding family responsibilities and the Parent's health, which do not help in producing a meaningful continuation of the current conversation about the advertisement website. The sentences are structured and cohesive; however, they do not provide significant information that relates to the development or causality of the current topic. Hence, MEMORY lacks helpfulness for generating the next response relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
