Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Wife, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I'm feeling stuck with my writing. I've been searching everywhere for new ideas, but nothing seems to work.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The wife suggests that husband should try using more modern language to be better understood, causing the husband to talk differently than most people, using words like \"thou\" and \"thee.\"\n2. The husband is open to learning more about movies, showing a willingness to try again, which leads to him acknowledging that it may be difficult for the wife but wants to be honest about his feelings for Sarah, and they both express a desire for happiness and understanding in the situation.\n3. The husband is open to learning more about movies, showing a willingness to try again, which leads to him acknowledging that it may be difficult for the wife but wants to be honest about his feelings for Sarah, and then he agrees to try adapting to modern language for better communication with his wife. The wife reassures the husband that it's okay to be different and encourages him to embrace who he is.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does provide some context that could be useful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions that the wife has suggested using more modern language, which is relevant since the husband is struggling with writing and searching for new ideas. It also highlights the husband's openness to adapting and willingness to communicate, which could inform a supportive or encouraging response from the wife. However, the MEMORY contains some repetition and lacks clarity in the development of events. The connections between the husband's interest in movies, his feelings for Sarah, and the suggestion of using modern language are not as clear as they could be, which might make it difficult for the language model to determine the most relevant cues for the current dialogue. Overall, while there is helpful information present, the MEMORY could be structured in a more concise and coherent manner to fully support response generation."
