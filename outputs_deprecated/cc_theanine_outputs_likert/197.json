Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager!\nCo-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge.\nCo-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail.\nCo-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of new products, remember when you used to fantasize about being a great leader?\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B encourages Co-worker A to consider pursuing a leadership position and highlights the qualities of a good leader.\nCo-worker A acknowledges the importance of communication and resolving conflicts.\nCo-worker A advises Co-worker A to take small steps and have one conversation at a time.\nCo-worker A has fantasies of being a great leader.\nCo-worker A is focused on getting along and working smoothly with Co-worker B.\nCo-worker B acknowledges and supports Co-worker A's growth and progress.\nCo-worker B advises Co-worker A to take small steps and have one conversation at a time.\nCo-worker A considers taking on more responsibility at work as a start towards being a leader.\nCo-worker B acknowledges the importance of communication and resolving conflicts.\nCo-worker A is willing to calm down and have a conversation with Co-worker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains several sentences that are relevant and helpful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Key related memories include Co-worker A's aspirations of becoming a great leader, their willingness to work smoothly with Co-worker B, and Co-worker B's encouragement, which ties well into Co-worker A's recent promotion and interest in leadership. The presence of supportive interactions, such as acknowledgment of growth, and encouragement towards pursuing leadership, align with the ongoing dialogue about promotion and responsibility. Additionally, the focus on communication and conflict resolution complements the skills required for product management. Even though some sentences are repetitive or less directly related, they are naturally phrased and maintain thematic relevance, making it easier for a language model to filter out less useful information. Overall, the MEMORY helps provide context and continuity for the dialogue's themes of leadership and professional development."
