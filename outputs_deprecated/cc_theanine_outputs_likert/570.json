Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination.\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor B reminds Neighbor A of their potential to do good things, referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them because Neighbor B is grateful and surprised by the generous offer from Neighbor A. Neighbor A enjoys building houses and finishing them quickly, which caused Neighbors A to help Neighbors B build a new house with amazing features that Neighbors A found challenging but rewarding. Last week, Neighbor A started construction on the house and plans to finish it in record time with the help of friends, which Neighbors A found challenging but rewarding.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provided offers a mixed level of helpfulness in relation to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. On one hand, it introduces a past interaction where Neighbor A has demonstrated the ability to focus and complete a complex task such as building a house. This information could potentially be helpful for understanding Neighbor A's capabilities and for encouraging them in the current situation of needing to focus on a project. However, the MEMORY is quite detailed and specific about the house-building, which may not directly enhance the current discussion about procrastination. The connection between the MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is somewhat implicit, relying on the theme of completing challenging tasks. While the MEMORY does provide some context about Neighbor A's character and past success in focusing on tasks, it lacks direct relevance to the immediate problem of procrastination discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Therefore, the information is somewhat helpful but could be more directly tied to the current topic."
