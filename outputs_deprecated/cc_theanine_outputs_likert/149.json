    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate B working on finishing a history project caused Classmates A's grades to look good according to their teacher. This led to Classmates A showing up to school in pajamas due to oversleeping after studying late, which Classmate B recalls a funny moment from high school involving Classmates A wearing pajamas to school.\n\n2. Classmate A working on an essay about the Industrial Revolution made Classmates B notice Classmates A's improvement and acknowledge their hard work. This made Classmates B supportive of Classmates A's new relationship and believe they found someone who makes them happy.\n\n3. Classmate B being interested in attending a new technology conference next month made Classmates B notice Classmates A's improvement and acknowledge their hard work. This also made Classmates B supportive of Classmates A's new relationship and believe they found someone who makes them happy.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It was all about the impact of social media on mental health.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nThe MEMORY provided does not offer helpful information for generating an appropriate response related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Classmates A mentions attending an interesting talk. The sentences in MEMORY focus on unrelated topics like history projects, wearing pajamas to school, essays on the Industrial Revolution, and relationships, none of which connect to the idea of attending a talk. Additionally, the sentences are not structured in a way that clearly demonstrates any development or causality between Classmates A and B's interactions regarding the mentioned talk. This lack of relevance and natural connection makes the MEMORY unhelpful for the context given."
