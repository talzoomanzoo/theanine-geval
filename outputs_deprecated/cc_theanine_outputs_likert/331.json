Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, how's it going?\nNeighbors B: Not bad, thanks. How about you?\nNeighbors A: Oh, I'm doing alright. I was just thinking about the old days when I had my rock band.\nNeighbors B: Really? You had a band?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A has been dealing with back pain for a few months but sought help from a chiropractor, avoiding surgery. As a result, Neighbors A looks forward to playing with Neighbors B again when feeling better and wants to do so. They also appreciated the support and friendship of Neighbors B.\n\nNeighbor A offered to provide the name of their chiropractor to Neighbor B if they decide to go, showing their willingness to help. Additionally, Neighbors A and Neighbors B enjoy playing together with toys and appreciate each other's support and friendship.\n\nNeighbor B is interested in chiropractic care after hearing about Neighbor A's positive experience, which causes Neighbors A to look forward to playing with Neighbors B again when feeling better. Neighbors A recently moved to London from their current location, which brings up the reaction of Neighbors A having moved to London in the past and having to learn how to manage stress.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, it was a lot of fun. We used to play at local gigs and it was a great way to unwind.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information about the relationship and interactions between Neighbors A and B, such as their mutual support and shared activities (e.g., playing together, offering healthcare advice). However, much of the MEMORY is not directly linked to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on Neighbors A's past involvement in a rock band. The mention of Neighbors A's move to London and dealing with back pain provides background context, but it's not directly useful for generating a response to the immediate discussion about the rock band. Additionally, while the MEMORY has some naturally structured sentences, the overall connection and causality between the past interactions and the present conversation topic are not clearly demonstrated. Thus, while there are some helpful elements, they are not sufficient to merit a higher score."
