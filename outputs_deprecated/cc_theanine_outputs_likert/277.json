Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel really fulfilled as a leader and guide. Helping others gives me a sense of purpose.\nCo-workers B: I can see that. You always seem to know just what to do to make people feel better.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I've had a lot of practice over the years. It's just something that comes naturally to me.\nCo-workers B: Do you remember that time when you were led to a safe place by the commander? You must have felt pretty grateful for his guidance then.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A wants to ensure the best production for the audience and hopes to find a compromise with the director. Co-worker B values finding fulfillment in work, pursuing hobbies, making a difference in the world, and building relationships with others.\n2. Co-worker B offers encouragement and believes things will work out in the end. Co-worker A had a positive experience with a commander who helped them feel safe.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that can help generate a proper response in the given dialogue context. It includes two key pieces of information: \n\n1. Co-worker B values finding fulfillment in work and making a difference, aligning with the dialogue context where Co-worker A talks about feeling fulfilled as a leader.\n2. Co-worker A had a positive experience with a commander, which directly ties to the context where Co-worker B mentions this previous experience. \n\nThese connections are clearly relevant and allow for a better understanding of the current interaction. However, the first piece of memory about Co-worker A wanting to ensure the best production for the audience and hoping to find a compromise with the director, though naturally phrased, does not directly connect to the current dialogue. This slightly reduces the overall helpfulness but still provides a clear background for understanding Co-worker A's leadership qualities."
