Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Why is your face so red and splotchy, Classmates B? Did you get sunburned?\nClassmates B: No, I didn't get sunburned. I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed.\nClassmates A: Embarrassed? Why?\nClassmates B: It's nothing, really. Just something embarrassing happened to me earlier.\nClassmates A: Come on, tell me! I won't judge you, I promise.\nClassmates B: Well, I accidentally spilled my lunch all over myself in front of some people.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A supported Classmates B during a difficult situation, which reflects their determination to not give up in challenging situations, and in return, Classmates B praised Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.\n2. Classmates A's support for Classmates B was hindered by their belief in friendship and mutual support.\n3. Classmates A's support for Classmates B led to Classmate A pushing themselves to do better, emphasizing the importance of hard work and dedication in skill improvement.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nThe MEMORY provided does not offer helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY describes previous supportive interactions and experiences between Classmates A and B, but these entries do not seem to have a clear or relevant connection to the context of the dialogue, which is about Classmate B being embarrassed due to spilling lunch on themselves. Moreover, the sentences in MEMORY are not naturally structured or relevant to the immediate conversation, as they focus on unrelated supportive experiences and emphasize themes of resilience, quick thinking, and hard work, without a clear link to the current situation of embarrassment faced by Classmate B. Therefore, the MEMORY does not provide a useful basis for understanding or continuing the current dialogue."
