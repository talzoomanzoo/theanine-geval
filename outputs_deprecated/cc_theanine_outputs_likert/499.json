Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hi there, I was wondering if you'd like to join me for lunch on Tuesday at the school cafeteria.\nCo-workers B: Oh, sure. Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking?\nCo-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for asking me to join you.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A has made mistakes in the past but is trying to be more aware of their actions, which has led Co-worker B to move on from their arrest and appreciate Co-worker A's concern and change in behavior. As a result, Co-worker B is supportive and encouraging towards Co-worker A. Co-worker A is trying to be more conscious of how their actions impact others and avoid causing problems for anyone else, prompting Co-worker B to reassure them that making mistakes is okay as long as they learn from them. This reassurance from Co-worker B also encourages Co-worker A to have more confidence. Additionally, Co-worker B mentions that Co-worker A is responsible in their work, even if not always in other aspects of life, and reminds them of their progress and potential for success.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about the relationship between Co-worker A and Co-worker B. It highlights Co-worker A's attempts to be more mindful of their actions after making mistakes, and how Co-worker B has supported and encouraged Co-worker A's improvements. This information is relevant as it highlights a positive relationship between the two, which aligns with the friendly invitation to lunch. However, there is no direct mention of any shared lunch experiences or planning, which would be directly beneficial in generating the next response. The MEMORY also details Co-worker A's past mistakes and Co-worker B's role in reassuring them, which could be somewhat excessive for the current context of arranging a casual lunch. Therefore, while the MEMORY provides some helpful background, it lacks direct relevance to improve the language model's ability to generate a response specific to the lunch context."
