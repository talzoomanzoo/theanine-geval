Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination.\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off.\nNeighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks?\nNeighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else.\nNeighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location?\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home.\nNeighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become.\nNeighbors A: You're right, I need to stop making excuses and just get it done. Thanks for the advice.\nNeighbors B: No problem. Speaking of goals, how's the house project coming along? \nNeighbors A: It's finished! Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard. It was a lot of work, but worth it in the end. \nNeighbors B: That's amazing, thanks for building me such a beautiful house. \nNeighbors A: Of course, I'm glad you like it. Remember when we watched the sunset over the London skyline? That was such a beautiful moment.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A's enjoyment of building houses and finishing them quickly led to Neighbor A helping Neighbor B build a new house with amazing features. This act made Neighbor B grateful for the extra space and reminded Neighbor B of Neighbor A's potential to do good things. Additionally, Neighbor A's love for building houses prompted Neighbor A to take care of flowers as a calming activity.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I remember that day. It was truly magical. The view was breathtaking.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information that adds context to the conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Neighbor A's enjoyment of building houses and helping Neighbor B with theirs, which is relevant to the latter part of the dialogue where they discuss the house project. This helps in understanding the relationship between the two neighbors and their appreciation for each other's contributions. However, the memory also includes unrelated information about Neighbor A taking care of flowers, which is not connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT or the discussion about procrastination and task completion. This unrelated information slightly detracts from the overall helpfulness but does not overwhelm the relevant points. Overall, the MEMORY is moderately helpful in providing context and background, but not all the information is directly useful for generating the next response."
