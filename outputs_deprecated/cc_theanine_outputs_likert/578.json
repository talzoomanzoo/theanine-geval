Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination.\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off.\nNeighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks?\nNeighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else.\nNeighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location?\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home.\nNeighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become.\nNeighbors A: You're right, I need to stop making excuses and just get it done. Thanks for the advice.\nNeighbors B: No problem. Speaking of goals, how's the house project coming along? \nNeighbors A: It's finished! Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard. It was a lot of work, but worth it in the end. \n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A's enjoyment of building houses quickly led to them helping Neighbor B build a new house with amazing features. This act made Neighbor B remind Neighbor A of their potential to do good things, referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them. As a result, Neighbor A wanted to ensure plants thrive by providing sunlight, water, and love. \n\nNeighbor A's admiration for Neighbor B prompted them to do something special, resulting in helping Neighbor B build a new house with amazing features. This act also caused Neighbor B to receive a new house from Neighbor A and feel grateful for the extra space. \n\nNeighbor A's passion for building houses quickly resulted in them finding the process of building the new house challenging yet rewarding, especially with the help of friends.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds amazing! I bet it turned out beautifully.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provided does contain some relevant information about Neighbor A's interest in building houses and their collaboration with Neighbor B. However, it lacks coherence and connection to the dialogue context. The sentences are repetitive and their phrasing does not clearly demonstrate the development or causality between past events and the current conversation. While there is some attempt to show Neighbor A's passion for building houses, the overall structure and details do not align well with the context or provide useful cues to generate a relevant next response. The MEMORY could have been more helpful and coherently structured to highlight key past collaborations or interactions related to the ongoing discussion about projects and managing work."
