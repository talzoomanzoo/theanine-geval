Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend!\nCo-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while.\nCo-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing?\nCo-workers A: I sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites.\nCo-workers B: That's such a beautiful song. You have a great voice.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A and Co-worker B both plan to treat themselves to a nice dinner with their paychecks. They suggest celebrating their detective work with drinks after work. Co-worker B, who is married, had a weekend where they went hiking and had dinner with friends. Co-worker A and Co-worker B shared happy memories from their time working together. \nCo-worker A and Co-worker B are both looking forward to the new athletic wear and mention getting a discount on their purchases. They work at a clothing store and are interested in upcoming sales. Co-worker A, described as having \"Sherlock Holmes-like skills\" and enjoys solving mysteries, did some research on social media to find out that Co-worker B is married, which surprised Co-worker B. \nCo-worker A and Co-worker B used to work together at a clothing store.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some background information about Co-worker A and Co-worker B's past interactions, such as planning to celebrate their detective work together, working at a clothing store, interest in athletic wear, and Co-worker B's marital status. However, these details are not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is focused on Co-worker A's singing at church. While the memory suggests a friendly and collaborative relationship, it lacks information that would help the language model generate a suitable response to the current conversation topic of singing. The MEMORY does not clearly develop causality or connections pertinent to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, thus limiting its helpfulness in this scenario."
