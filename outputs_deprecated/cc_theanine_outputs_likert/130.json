Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I'm the boss!\nCo-workers B: Yeah, we know. You don't have to remind us every five minutes.\nCo-workers A: I just want everything to go smoothly and according to plan.\nCo-workers B: I understand that, but it doesn't always have to be your way or the highway.\nCo-workers A: Well, I just think that my way is usually the best way.\nCo-workers B: And sometimes it is, but we all have different ideas and perspectives to bring to the table.\nCo-workers A: Okay, I see your point. I'll try to be more open-minded in the future.\nCo-workers B: That's all we can ask for. Remember that we're a team and we all have something valuable to contribute.\nCo-workers A: You're right. I'm glad we can have these conversations and work towards being better together.\n\nMEMORY:\n[Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace.] - (React) - [Co-worker A and Co-worker B excel at working well with others and resolving issues.] - (React) - [Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's effort in giving them a massage to help them relax.] \n[Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace.] - (SameTopic) - [Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B value communication and understanding in relationships.] - (SameTopic) - [Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B enjoy connecting with each other to make work more enjoyable.] \n[Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace.] - (React) - [Co-worker A and Co-worker B excel at working well with others and resolving issues.] - (React) - [Co-worker A's massage to Co-worker B helps them feel relaxed and at peace.]\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely, open communication and collaboration are key to our success as a team. Thank you for being willing to consider different perspectives.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information that is somewhat helpful for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it lacks specificity and clear connections to the immediate conversation. The MEMORY references Co-worker B acknowledging Co-worker A's good work ethic and the ability of both co-workers to resolve issues, which could imply some relevant background to why Co-worker B is urging A to be more open to team contributions. Additionally, the repeated mention of their strong communication and relationship values could support the current discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about teamwork and cooperation. However, the references to Co-worker A giving Co-worker B a massage are disjointed from the task-oriented dialogue and don't contribute to understanding the exchange concerning leadership and teamwork. Overall, while the MEMORY does embody the theme of cooperation, it lacks direct causal or developmental links to the immediate conversation, making it moderately helpful."
