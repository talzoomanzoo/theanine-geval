Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today.\nClassmates B:  That sounds great. What was the talk about?\nClassmates A: It was about the history of the pyramids in Egypt. I learned so much about their construction and the cultural significance they held.\nClassmates B: Wow, that does sound interesting. Did you take any notes?\nClassmates A: Yes, I took lots of notes. I'm excited to study this topic more on my own time.\nClassmates B: That's awesome. It's great to see your enthusiasm for learning.\nClassmates A: Thanks. I've always been passionate about learning new things. Remember when we talked about how determined I was to get into college?\nClassmates B: Yeah, I remember. You were always studying and taking extra classes.\nClassmates A: And now, after all that hard work, I am actually in college. It just goes to show that with dedication, you can achieve your goals.\nClassmates B: That's so inspiring. It also reminds me of when you wore your pajamas to school. You were always doing something different and unique.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates A's dedication to studying hard and taking extra classes to get into a good college caused them to show up to school in pajamas due to oversleeping after studying late. This reminds Classmates B of a funny moment from high school involving Classmates A wearing pajamas to school.\nClassmates A's dedication to studying hard and taking extra classes to get into a good college makes them want to work on an essay about the Industrial Revolution. Furthermore, their dedication also makes them value being true to themselves and expressing their own style, which their girlfriend appreciates.\nStruggling with motivation while working on an essay about the Industrial Revolution, Classmates A found a way to stay focused by thinking about the payoff of their hard work. This determination leads them to be willing to work hard to achieve their dreams and receive support from Classmates B in their new relationship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Haha, good times. I've always liked adding my own twist to things.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information that aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly regarding Classmates A's dedication to their studies and desire to achieve their goals. This connection is evident in the MEMORY's description of Classmates A's commitment to studying hard to get into college. However, some details in the MEMORY, such as the emphasis on the essay about the Industrial Revolution, are not directly pertinent to the immediate dialogue about learning about the pyramids in Egypt and the college conversation. Moreover, the MEMORY could be more concisely structured and consistently related to the primary conversation to provide a clearer context for generating future responses. Overall, while the MEMORY contains useful elements, it lacks a highly cohesive narrative directly reflecting the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which affects its overall helpfulness for generating the next response."
