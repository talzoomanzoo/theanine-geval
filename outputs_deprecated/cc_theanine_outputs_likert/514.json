    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I know you know something about my past. Can you tell me what it is?\nClassmates B: I'm sorry,, but I can't disclose that information. It's not my place to tell.\nClassmates A: But how did you find out? I haven't told anyone.\nClassmates B: Let's just say I have my ways of finding out things. But don't worry,, it's nothing bad or embarrassing.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B warns Classmates A about the potential danger of dark alleys because Classmates A doesn't have their own car yet and takes the bus.\n2. Classmates B appreciates the genuine friendship and positive attitude of Classmates A, which causes Classmates A to be curious and open to exploring new things and taking risks.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about the relationship between Classmates A and B; Classmates B warns Classmates A about dark alleys and appreciates their friendship and positive attitude. However, these details do not clearly connect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Classmates A is inquiring about what Classmates B knows about their past. The MEMORY lacks specific information that helps in generating an appropriate response to the current context. Additionally, the phrasing does not clearly demonstrate the development or relevance to the ongoing conversation about Classmates A's past. Overall, the MEMORY offers some background but does not offer sufficient or directly relevant information to aid the dialogue continuation."
