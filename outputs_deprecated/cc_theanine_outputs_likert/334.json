    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, how's it going?\nNeighbors B: Not bad, thanks. How about you?\nNeighbors A: Oh, I'm doing alright. I was just thinking about the old days when I had my rock band.\nNeighbors B: Really? You had a band?\nNeighbors A: Yeah, we were called \"The Neighbors A Band.\" We used to play live shows around the city.\nNeighbors B: That's awesome! What kind of music did you guys play?\nNeighbors A: We played rock music, mostly covers but we also wrote some of our own songs.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A's positive experience with chiropractic care causes Neighbor B to be interested in it. Neighbor A looks forward to playing with Neighbor B again when feeling better. Neighbor B is familiar with Neighbor A's dog and looking forward to playing with it again. Neighbor A appreciated the support and friendship of Neighbor B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some sentences that suggest past interactions and connections between Neighbors A and B, such as Neighbor A's appreciation for Neighbor B's support and friendship. However, it lacks specific, relevant information directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is focused on Neighbor A's past with a rock band. The MEMORY does mention that Neighbor A has a positive experience with chiropractic care and anticipates engaging with Neighbor B in the future, but these details do not aid in generating a relevant or natural next response connected to the conversation about the rock band. The MEMORY provides some context about the relationship between the neighbors, but it is not structured in a way that clearly demonstrates relevancy or causality in relation to the current conversation about the band."
