Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Wife, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today.\nWife: That's lovely! I always feel so cozy and comfortable when you do that.\nHusband: I know, and I love making the apartment feel like a warm and welcoming space for you.\nWife: You always go above and beyond, dear.\nHusband: It's the little things that count, right?\nWife: Definitely. Speaking of little things, do you remember when you told me about catching the bus just in time a few months ago?\nHusband: Oh yes, I remember. I was so relieved I didn't have to wait in the cold for the next one.\nWife: It's amazing how small moments like that can make such a big difference in our day, isn't it?\nHusband: Absolutely. It's the small moments that make life worth living.\nWife: And speaking of living, you mentioned a while back how involved you are in the different ministries at church.\nHusband: Yes, I'm so grateful for the community and support I've found there. It's helped me grow in my faith so much.\n\nMEMORY:\nThe husband values the supportive community of believers at church and appreciates having his wife by his side. This is similar to how his faith has been strong lately, and he is involved in various church ministries.\n\nBoth the husband and wife agree that it's the little things that add up and make life meaningful. This is reflected in the husband appreciating the little things in life, such as making it to the bus on time, which the wife mentions happened a couple of years ago.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures the key themes and sentiments expressed in the dialogue, such as the importance of appreciating \"the little things in life,\" represented by the husband's action of hanging up lights and candles and his relief at catching the bus on time. Additionally, the MEMORY aligns well with the dialogue's mention of the husband's involvement in church ministries and the supportive community of believers. The sentences are naturally structured, capturing the development of past interactions and reflecting the couple's shared values. The MEMORY is relevant, coherent, and sufficiently detailed to support language model responses that are consistent with the dialogue context."
