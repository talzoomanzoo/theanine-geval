Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\nCo-worker A spoke with the police about the incident and the women involved were thankful.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like quite the daring plan! Just make sure it's all in good fun and doesn't cause any trouble.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nThe MEMORY does not provide relevant information for generating a proper response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context involves Co-worker A discussing a plan to prevent a bride from getting married, but the MEMORY entries do not relate to this topic at all. The first memory sentence is about a borrowed pencil and buying coffee, while the second sentence is about a conversation with police and thankful women. Neither of these memories provides helpful information for the given dialogue context, nor do they demonstrate any development, causality, or connection relevant to the current conversation about the bride. They are unrelated and do not assist a language model in generating an appropriate or coherent next response."
