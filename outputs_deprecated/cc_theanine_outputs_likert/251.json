Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend!\nCo-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while.\nCo-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing?\nCo-workers A: I sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites.\nCo-workers B: That's such a beautiful song. You have a great voice.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! It was really nerve-wracking, but I'm glad I did it.\nCo-workers B: I'm sure the audience loved it. You've really got some talent.\nCo-workers A: Thanks again. It's just something I do for fun, but it's nice to know people enjoy it.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A and Co-worker B are excited about payday and being able to pay off bills. Co-worker A suggests celebrating their detective work with drinks after work. Co-worker B had a weekend where they went hiking and had dinner with friends.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's always fulfilling to share your talents with others. Maybe we can have a karaoke night sometime, I'd love to hear you sing again.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information that is mostly unrelated to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Co-worker A singing at church. It discusses a different event (payday, paying off bills, a suggestion to celebrate with drinks, and Co-worker B's hiking trip) which is not connected to the singing topic and the emotional exchange in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY does not provide helpful contextual information or relevant past interactions related to Co-worker A's singing experience, making it less effective in aiding a language model in generating a coherent and relevant next response for the area of conversation at hand. However, it is somewhat well-structured and clearly delineates separate past interactions, which is why it is awarded a score higher than 1."
