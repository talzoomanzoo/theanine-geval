    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Mentee, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Thank you for finding my glasses for me, Mentor. I always seem to misplace them.\nMentor: Not a problem, Mentee. I'm glad I could help. \n\nMEMORY:\n- Both the Mentor and Mentee believe that living in the moment can bring joy and strength in facing challenges. This mindset has led the Mentor to be supportive of Mentee's journey to sobriety, as the Mentor is willing to share their knowledge and help Mentee achieve their goals.\n- The Mentor's support of the Mentee's approach has encouraged the Mentee to continue on their path. This has resulted in Mentee crediting the Mentor for their help in achieving sobriety and expressing gratitude for the support, which in turn makes the Mentor proud of Mentee for making positive changes and taking control of their life.\n- Both the Mentor and Mentee share the belief in living in the moment to find joy and strength in challenges. This shared mindset has led the Mentor to acknowledge Mentee's achievements, provide ongoing support and guidance, and offer to share their knowledge to help Mentee reach their goals.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I really appreciate your attention to detail. It's great to have someone who's always there to lend a hand.",
    "prediction": "3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant information about the relationship between the Mentor and Mentee, specifically their shared belief in \"living in the moment\" and the Mentor supporting the Mentee's sobriety journey. This helps provide context for their positive dynamic and the Mentor's inclination to help Mentee in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, despite these connections, the MEMORY is somewhat repetitive and expansive, making it less efficient. Some overlap exists in describing the Mentor's support and Mentee's appreciation, which could be consolidated. While some connections to the dialogue are evident, the detail level and repetition dilute its immediate helpfulness in generating a focused next response."
