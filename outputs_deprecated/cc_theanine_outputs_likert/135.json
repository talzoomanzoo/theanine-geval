Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I'm the boss!\nCo-workers B: Yeah, we know. You don't have to remind us every five minutes.\nCo-workers A: I just want everything to go smoothly and according to plan.\nCo-workers B: I understand that, but it doesn't always have to be your way or the highway.\nCo-workers A: Well, I just think that my way is usually the best way.\nCo-workers B: And sometimes it is, but we all have different ideas and perspectives to bring to the table.\nCo-workers A: Okay, I see your point. I'll try to be more open-minded in the future.\nCo-workers B: That's all we can ask for. Remember that we're a team and we all have something valuable to contribute.\nCo-workers A: You're right. I'm glad we can have these conversations and work towards being better together.\nCo-workers B: Me too. Speaking of working together, do you remember when you gave me back my watch a few months ago? That meant a lot to me.\nCo-workers A: Of course I remember! I'm happy we're friends again.\nCo-workers B: Me too. And do you still have that baby doll and rattle you bought a couple of years ago?\nCo-workers A: Yes, actually! I gave them to my niece and she loves them.\nCo-workers B: That's awesome. And I still remember when you scratched my neck and helped me relax. Sometimes I still need that kind of release.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A's competence is recognized and appreciated in the workplace, contributing positively to the team dynamic. Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B emphasize the importance of effective communication and mutual understanding in their relationship. Co-worker A and Co-worker B cherish moments of connection, finding them essential for a more enjoyable work environment.   \nCo-worker A's gesture of returning Co-worker B's watch repaired their friendship, highlighting the significance of small acts of kindness. Co-worker A's thoughtful gift of a baby doll and rattle to their friend expecting a child showcases their caring nature. Co-worker A's decision to buy a baby doll and rattle for a friend's child despite not planning to have kids soon reflects their generous spirit.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information about the relationship and interactions between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, which is relevant to generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY includes information about Co-worker A's competence, their appreciation of effective communication, and the importance of mutual understanding â€” all of which align well with the themes present in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the MEMORY highlights specific past interactions, like returning a watch and giving thoughtful gifts, which Co-worker B brought up in the dialogue. These details show a connection and development in their relationship, helping to inform the dynamics in their current conversation. However, there are some parts (e.g., buying a baby doll for a friend's child instead of the niece) that could be more precisely aligned with the current dialogue, preventing a perfect score. Overall, the MEMORY is structured in a coherent manner and provides helpful context for the current conversation."
