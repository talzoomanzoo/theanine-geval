Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend!\nCo-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while.\nCo-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing?\nCo-workers A: I sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites.\nCo-workers B: That's such a beautiful song. You have a great voice.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! It was really nerve-wracking, but I'm glad I did it.\nCo-workers B: I'm sure the audience loved it. You've really got some talent.\nCo-workers A: Thanks again. It's just something I do for fun, but it's nice to know people enjoy it.\nCo-workers B: Definitely. It's great to have a hobby like that. Reminds me of when you uncovered that mystery a while back. You always seem to surprise us with your skills.\nCo-workers A: Haha, yeah. I do like a good challenge. Speaking of surprises, remember when I found out you were married? That was a shocker.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A, known for their \"Sherlock Holmes-like skills\" and passion for solving mysteries, used their observant nature to discover that Co-worker B was married, surprising them. \nCo-worker A proposed celebrating their detective work by having drinks after work, reminiscing about happy memories shared while working together. \nAdditionally, Co-worker A, who enjoys solving puzzles and mysteries, even thinking about becoming a detective, displayed their talent in uncovering secrets.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provided is reasonably helpful for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures relevant past interactions between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, highlighting Co-worker A's skills in solving mysteries and their discovery of Co-worker B's marital status. This directly relates to the conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Co-worker B brings up Co-worker A's talent in uncovering mysteries. The MEMORY also includes details about Co-worker A's personality, such as their passion for solving puzzles and considering a career as a detective, which enrich the understanding of Co-worker A's character. The sentences in MEMORY are naturally connected and provide useful context for developing future dialogue. However, the MEMORY could be improved by including more specific details or interactions that are directly relevant to the ongoing dialogue, which would elevate it to a score of 5."
