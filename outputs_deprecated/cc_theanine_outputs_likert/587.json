    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Wife, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I'm feeling stuck with my writing. I've been searching everywhere for new ideas, but nothing seems to work.\nWife: Have you tried brainstorming with me? Sometimes bouncing ideas off of someone else can help.\nHusband: I have, but I don't want to bother you too much with my writing stuff.\n\nMEMORY:\nThe husband is open to learning more about movies, showing a willingness to try again. The wife remembers the husband being nervous before the presentation.\nThe wife is knowledgeable about movies and is willing to share her passion with the husband. Both the husband and wife express a desire for happiness and understanding in the situation. The husband gave a fifth-grade presentation in the past.\nThe husband and wife plan to have a movie night together in the future. Both the husband and wife express a desire for happiness and understanding in the situation. Husband agrees to try adapting to modern language for better communication with his wife. The wife reassures the husband that it's okay to be different and encourages him to embrace who he is.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "You're not bothering me at all. I enjoy helping you with your writing. Let's brainstorm together and see if we can come up with something new.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some scattered information about the husband's interest in movies and past experiences, which could potentially be helpful for generating responses about diversifying ideas or experiences. However, it lacks direct relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as it does not pertain to the husband's writing struggles or potential solutions. The MEMORY additionally contains redundant information such as mutual desires for happiness, which does not clearly contribute to the context of the current dialogue. Overall, the MEMORY lacks clear connections or developments in relation to the specific issue at hand, which diminishes its helpfulness in generating a response relevant to the context."
