    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm really excited about finding a buyer for my product. I think it has a lot of potential.\nNeighbors B: That's great to hear, what kind of product is it?\nNeighbors A: It's a new type of workout equipment that's designed to be more efficient than traditional equipment. I've been working on it for months now and I really think it's going to take off.\nNeighbors B: Wow, that sounds interesting. Have you started looking for potential buyers?\nNeighbors A: Yes, I've been reaching out to various gyms and fitness centers to see if they'd be interested in carrying the product. I've even gotten some positive feedback from a few places.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A is making an effort to improve themselves and work on their actions, which was advised by Neighbors B to become a responsible adult. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's journey to change for the better and has appreciated their support during a tough situation. Neighbors A understands the importance of working harder, being kinder to colleagues, and improving their behavior, all while striving to be a better colleague. Neighbors B desires success for Neighbors A and stresses the significance of respecting others and putting in effort at work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's fantastic news! It's great to hear that you're already getting positive feedback. Keep up the good work!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains helpful information regarding the supportive and positive relationship between Neighbors A and B. It highlights Neighbors B's desire for Neighbors A's success and their encouragement for Neighbors A to work hard and be responsible. However, while it reflects an overall supportive dynamic, the MEMORY lacks specific information directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about the product or business interactions. Therefore, while it provides useful context about their relationship, it may not significantly aid in generating the next response focused on the product discussion."
