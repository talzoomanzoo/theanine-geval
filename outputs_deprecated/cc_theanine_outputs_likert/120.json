Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I really enjoy being a carpenter. It's a very fulfilling job.\nClassmates B: That's great to hear! How did you get into carpentry?\nClassmates A: My dad was a carpenter, so I grew up around it. I started by helping him out when I was young, and then I began to really enjoy it myself.\nClassmates B: That's awesome that you were able to learn from your dad and turn it into a career. Have you done any big projects lately?\nClassmates A: Yeah, I just finished building a custom bookshelf for a client. It was a challenging project, but I'm really happy with how it turned out.\nClassmates B: That's impressive! You must have a lot of skill to be able to build something like that.\nClassmates A: Thanks! It definitely takes a lot of practice and attention to detail. But I find it really rewarding to see a finished product that I created with my own two hands.\nClassmates B: I can imagine. It must also be nice to have a steady income from your work.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate A supports the President and believes he is doing a good job. This aligns with Classmates A appreciating the support and encouragement from Classmates B, who in turn is supportive and encourages Classmate A to pursue their dream.\n2. Classmate A mentions the President's policies to boost job growth as progress in the economy, leading to Classmates A being interested in entrepreneurship and signing up for a seminar on starting a business. This causes Classmates A to attend the seminar, excited about applying that knowledge to future plans, and wanting to explore singing, a passion that they never thought possible until now.\n3. Classmate A supports the President and believes he is doing a good job, which is the same topic when Classmates A appreciates the support and encouragement from Classmates B. This leads to Classmates A wanting to get to know Classmates B better and become friends, and also considering reaching out to vocal coaches to improve singing skills.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Classmates A",
    "raw_prediction": "It definitely provides a sense of stability, which is important. Plus, I get to be creative and work with my hands, which I love.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does not align closely with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context revolves around Classmate A's career as a carpenter, the influence of their father, and recent projects, whereas the MEMORY mostly discusses political support, entrepreneurship, and singing ambitions of Classmate A, which are not connected to the carpentry discussion in the context. The MEMORY lacks relevance and direct connection to the specific dialogue, making it less helpful for generating a coherent and contextually appropriate continuation of the conversation. However, the MEMORY offers some insight into Classmate A's personality and interests outside of the immediate dialogue context, which could be slightly beneficial for broader character development. The sentences in MEMORY are naturally structured, but their content isn't directly useful for the specific context provided."
