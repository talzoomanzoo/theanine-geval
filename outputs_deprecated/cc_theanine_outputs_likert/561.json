Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, how are you feeling today?\nClassmates B: I'm feeling frustrated. I wish I could do things on my own.\nClassmates A: I understand how you feel. It can be tough when you feel like you're dependent on others.\nClassmates B: Yeah, exactly. I don't want to be a burden on anyone.\nClassmates A: You're not a burden, don't worry. And I'm always here to help you out.\nClassmates B: I appreciate that, but I don't want to always rely on others. I want to be more independent.\nClassmates A: I get it. Maybe there are some small things you can do on your own to start feeling more independent?\nClassmates B: Like what?\nClassmates A: Well, maybe you can start by making a list of things you'd like to do on your own and we can work on achieving those goals together.\nClassmates B: That sounds like a good idea. Thanks for understanding, Classmates A.\nClassmates A: Of course, I'm always here to support you. Hey, speaking of goals, remember when we talked about your guitar playing a few months ago? How's that going?\nClassmates B: It's going really well, thanks for asking! I've been practicing every day and I feel like I'm getting better.\nClassmates A: That's awesome! Have you thought about joining a band or playing gigs around town?\nClassmates B: Not really, I'm still a bit nervous about performing in front of people.\nClassmates A: I get it, performing can be scary. But maybe in a few months, we can work on setting a goal for you to do a small performance somewhere.\nClassmates B: That sounds like a challenge, but also kind of exciting. I'm in!\n\nMEMORY:\n- Classmates A and B are both keeping up with the homework in their math class, and they enjoy jamming together and plan to collaborate on music in the future.\n- Classmates A plays the guitar, takes lessons, and plays in a band, while Classmates B is working on a new original song on the guitar.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad you're open to the idea! It could be a great way to build your confidence and showcase your talent.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that both Classmates A and B have a shared interest in music and are actively involved in playing the guitar, which aligns with the discussion about Classmate B's guitar playing in the dialogue. This information enhances the understanding of the current conversation by providing context on Classmates A and B's musical interests and future plans to collaborate, which can influence the development of their interaction and goals. Furthermore, the MEMORY is structured well enough to make the information about their shared activities clear and relevant. However, the mention of keeping up with math class homework, while potentially useful background information, doesn't directly connect with the specific focus on independence and guitar playing in the current dialogue context. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate as the MEMORY mostly supports the dialogue and offers clarity on the interaction without extraneous details."
