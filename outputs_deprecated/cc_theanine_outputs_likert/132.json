Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I'm the boss!\nCo-workers B: Yeah, we know. You don't have to remind us every five minutes.\nCo-workers A: I just want everything to go smoothly and according to plan.\nCo-workers B: I understand that, but it doesn't always have to be your way or the highway.\nCo-workers A: Well, I just think that my way is usually the best way.\nCo-workers B: And sometimes it is, but we all have different ideas and perspectives to bring to the table.\nCo-workers A: Okay, I see your point. I'll try to be more open-minded in the future.\nCo-workers B: That's all we can ask for. Remember that we're a team and we all have something valuable to contribute.\nCo-workers A: You're right. I'm glad we can have these conversations and work towards being better together.\nCo-workers B: Me too. Speaking of working together, do you remember when you gave me back my watch a few months ago? That meant a lot to me.\nCo-workers A: Of course I remember! I'm happy we're friends again.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A's good work ethic and positive impact on the workplace are acknowledged by Co-worker B, highlighting their contribution to the team dynamic.\n\nCo-worker A and Co-worker B had a disagreement but managed to resolve it, ultimately becoming friends again after Co-worker A returned Co-worker B's watch, symbolizing the restoration of their friendship.\n\nCo-worker B finds the massage from Co-worker A relaxing, helping them feel at peace and fostering a sense of camaraderie between them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It really symbolized the restoration of our friendship. I appreciate your thoughtfulness.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures the essence of the resolution and renewed friendship between Co-worker A and Co-worker B after a disagreement, specifically referencing the return of the watch, which is directly mentioned in the dialogue. This demonstrates a clear development of events and personal connection between the co-workers. Additionally, the memory also highlights Co-worker A's positive contributions and work ethic, which can be seen as underlying themes in the dialogue about teamwork and mutual respect. While the mention of the massage is not directly relevant to the dialogue context, it is phrased naturally and does not detract from understanding the overall interactions between the co-workers. Overall, the MEMORY effectively provides contextual cues for generating appropriate responses based on the dialogue context, with clear relevancy and development."
