Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hi there, I was wondering if you'd like to join me for lunch on Tuesday at the school cafeteria.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Co-worker A is trying to be more conscious of how their actions impact others and avoid causing problems for anyone else. This leads to Co-worker B reassuring Co-worker A that making mistakes is okay as long as they learn from them, and then encouraging them to have more confidence.\n- Co-worker A has made mistakes in the past but is trying to be more aware of their actions, causing Co-worker B to move on from their arrest and appreciate Co-worker A's concern and change in behavior. This leads to Co-worker B reminding Co-worker A of their progress and potential for success, as well as being supportive and encouraging towards Co-worker A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "2\n\nThe MEMORY provides a vague representation of past interactions between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, with a focus on Co-worker A's personal development and Co-worker B's supportive role. However, it lacks clarity and specificity regarding how these interactions are relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT of an invitation to lunch. While the memory mentions a change in Co-worker A's behavior and Co-worker B's reassurance, it does not offer clear, directly useful information in relation to the particular context of inviting someone to lunch. The sentences are too general and do not show a clear connection or causality to the present context, which limits the usefulness of the memory for generating an appropriate response. Additionally, the mention of an \"arrest\" comes out of nowhere and adds confusion rather than clarity. Overall, MEMORY could be better structured and more directly relevant to improve its helpfulness."
