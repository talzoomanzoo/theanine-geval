    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Teacher, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn.\nTeacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation?\nStudent: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle.\n\nMEMORY:\nThe student felt rewarded by the experience of being aware of surroundings and acting quickly in emergencies. This led to the teacher offering support and reassurance, emphasizing their availability to talk. Furthermore, both the teacher and student share a positive and understanding relationship.\n\nThe teacher's encouragement for the student to prioritize safety and help others caused the student to mention feeling stressed lately, potentially leading to an outburst. As a result, the student expresses excitement about retiring and spending time with their grandkids, already planning fun activities.\n\nThe student's appreciation for the rewarding experience of being aware of surroundings and acting quickly in emergencies was echoed in their gratitude towards the teacher's support. The student also apologized to the teacher for yelling in the hallway, acknowledging it was out of character and seeking to move past it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's all about finding the right balance between flavor and heat. Have you tried pairing it with something to help mellow out the spiciness?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nThe provided MEMORY does not appear to offer any relevant or helpful information for generating a proper next response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is focused on a conversation about the experience of eating hot sauce, including the enjoyment of its spiciness and the challenges related to it. However, MEMORY contains details unrelated to this context, such as the student's experience with emergencies, feeling stressed, considerations about retirement, and interactions involving an apology for yelling. These memory points do not connect to nor develop the ideas presented in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about hot sauce or the specific interaction between the student and teacher in that context. Hence, the MEMORY does not provide helpful information or contextual cues needed to support the ongoing conversation, resulting in a score of 1."
