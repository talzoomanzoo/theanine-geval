Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Athlete, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nAthlete: Ted Athlete unrolls the map. He looks at it for a few moments before tracing his finger along one of the highways. \"This is our route,\" he says finally, feeling in control.\nCoach: What route are you planning, Ted?\nAthlete: I'm thinking of taking the highway through the mountains, it's a bit longer, but the scenery is beautiful.\nCoach: That sounds like a good plan, as long as we factor in enough time for rest stops and breaks.\n\nMEMORY:\nThe Athlete is focused on improving their performance and energy levels. This focus has led to the Athlete taking on more responsibilities and gaining respect from other players. Both the Athlete and Coach emphasize the importance of small changes in diet impacting performance.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some background information about the Athlete's focus on performance and gaining respect, as well as the mutual emphasis on diet between the Athlete and Coach. However, this information does not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is centered around planning a route for a journey. The MEMORY lacks specific connections or developments that pertain to the current scenario or dialogue, making it less helpful in generating the next response based on the current conversation. The details about performance and energy levels do not contribute immediately to the dialogue topic about route planning through mountainous scenery. Therefore, while the MEMORY includes some general insights into the Athlete and Coach's relationship, it offers limited relevance to the current dialogue."
