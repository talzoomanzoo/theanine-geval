Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend!\nCo-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while.\nCo-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing?\nCo-workers A: I sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites.\nCo-workers B: That's such a beautiful song. You have a great voice.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! It was really nerve-wracking, but I'm glad I did it.\nCo-workers B: I'm sure the audience loved it. You've really got some talent.\nCo-workers A: Thanks again. It's just something I do for fun, but it's nice to know people enjoy it.\nCo-workers B: Definitely. It's great to have a hobby like that. Reminds me of when you uncovered that mystery a while back. You always seem to surprise us with your skills.\nCo-workers A: Haha, yeah. I do like a good challenge. Speaking of surprises, remember when I found out you were married? That was a shocker.\nCo-workers B: Oh gosh, yes. I forget sometimes that not everyone knows. But yeah, I've been married for a few years now.\nCo-workers A: Crazy how time flies. Like when we found out Ms. Singh was leaving our school. I still can't believe that was two years ago.\nCo-workers B: I know, right? She was such a great teacher. Speaking of which, have you heard anything about her lately?\nCo-workers A: Not really. I think she moved to another state, but I'm not sure where.\nCo-workers B: Ah, okay. Well, hopefully she's doing well wherever she is. But hey, getting back to your solo, I think you should definitely do it again sometime.\nCo-workers A: Really? You think so?\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A and Co-worker B shared happy memories from their time working together, reminiscing about uncovering mysteries and surprises from the past.\nCo-worker A suggests celebrating their detective work with drinks after work, sparking excitement for payday and the ability to pay off bills.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely! Your voice is too good not to share with others. Maybe you could even perform at the next company event.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some background on the interactions between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, mentioning their shared experiences and surprises, which is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the memory about celebrating detective work and discussing finances does not directly aid in generating a response in the current conversation about Co-worker A's solo singing experience and previous surprises. The sentences in the MEMORY are not structured in a way that firmly relates to the ongoing dialogue about singing and personal revelations, such as remembering marriage or Ms. Singh leaving. The connection between past interactions and the current context is only weakly demonstrated, making the MEMORY slightly relevant but not particularly helpful in generating the next response."
