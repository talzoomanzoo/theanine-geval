Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I just finished my computer course, and I learned so much about using computers effectively.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A has matured since acknowledging the mistake and plans to learn from it, showing growth from past mistakes.\n2. Classmates A used to dance a lot in middle school, which makes Classmate A appreciate having friends who are there for them during difficult times. This friendship extends to helping each other with schoolwork.\n3. Acknowledging the mistake, Classmates A is considering taking a dance class for fun.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some insights into the characteristics of Classmates A, but it offers limited helpful information for generating a response relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses specifically on learning from a computer course. The details about Classmates A maturing from past mistakes and their past involvement in dance are not directly connected to the current topic of effectively using computers. There is no clear development or causality indicated in relation to the context provided. Although there are mentions of learning and growth, these are not specifically tied to the skills or experiences relevant to computers, making it less helpful in guiding the appropriate next response."
