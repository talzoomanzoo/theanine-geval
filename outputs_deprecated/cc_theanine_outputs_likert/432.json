Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Mentee, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, have you ever tried to imagine what it would be like to think like someone else?\nMentor: Yes, I have. It's a great way to better understand and empathize with others.\nMentee: That's exactly what I thought. I've been trying to imagine what personY is thinking lately. It's been helping me to understand their perspective a bit better.\nMentor: That's a great approach. Putting ourselves in someone else's shoes can help us see things from a different angle and see where they're coming from.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentee, after agreeing to try the advice and expressing gratitude towards Mentor, is currently living in an abusive and controlling cult, which changed when Mentor suggested Mentee volunteer at a local church or religious organization to gain experience, as Mentor became a mentor to help others going through similar situations.\n   \n2. After Mentee agreed to try the advice and expressed gratitude towards Mentor, Mentee reacted by taking the idea of teaching religion seriously and wanting to make a positive impact on people's lives. This made Mentee want to make a positive impact in people's lives and feel grateful for Mentor's support.\n\n3. Following Mentee agreeing to try the advice and expressing gratitude towards Mentor, Mentee reacted by feeling suffocated and eager to leave the cult. This reaction made Mentee want to help others who may be in abusive cults.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's really eye-opening to see things from a different perspective. It's helping me navigate some challenging situations more effectively.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does provide some background information about past interactions between the Mentor and Mentee; however, the information presented is fragmented and repetitive. The insights about the Mentee's experiences with the cult and their reaction to the Mentor's advice are significant but not directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which revolves around understanding others' perspectives. The information lacks a clear connection to the current discussion and does not flow naturally to enhance the language model's ability to generate a suitable next response in the given context. The overall structure of the memory background is not well-organized and does not effectively provide a cohesive understanding of the past interactions that would help generate relevant responses related to empathy and perspective-taking."
