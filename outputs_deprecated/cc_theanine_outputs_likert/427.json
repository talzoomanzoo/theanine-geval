Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel so grateful to have a boss who is always so supportive of me.\nCo-workers B: That's amazing to hear. Having a supportive boss can make all the difference in how you feel about your job.\nCo-workers A: Definitely. It makes me feel secure in my position and motivated to do my best work.\nCo-workers B: It's great to have that kind of positive reinforcement. Do you remember when we were working on that movie together and you were feeling really frustrated?\nCo-workers A: Oh yeah, I remember. I was so angry after blowing up that rabbit with the dynamite. But talking it out with you really helped me work through my emotions.\nCo-workers B: That's right. It's important to have someone to talk to when you're feeling overwhelmed or upset.\nCo-workers A: And speaking of talking it out, do you remember when I was a kid and I ran to our parents screaming because of that spider?\nCo-workers B: Ha, yes I do! It's funny to think about now, but phobias are no laughing matter.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B emphasized the importance of learning from mistakes and working together as a team, which caused Co-worker A to acknowledge that some people have fears and suggests finding healthy ways to deal with frustrations. This led to Co-worker A overcoming fears and anxieties to create beautiful earrings.\n\nDuring the shoot, both Co-worker A and Co-worker B felt that their collaboration brought out the best in each other, leading Co-worker B to encourage Co-worker A to try relaxation techniques or find a hobby to de-stress and overcome fears. As a result, Co-worker A has grown as a person and as an artist, learning about empathy and compassion.\n\nAfter a tough week on set, Co-worker A mentioned a past event involving blowing up a rabbit with dynamite, indicating a history of poor coping mechanisms for frustration. This incident still angers Co-worker A, showing the need for better emotional management strategies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad we can look back on those moments now and see the growth we've made in handling our fears. It's all about finding healthy ways to cope and support each other.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful context for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it also includes some elements that are less directly relevant or not as well-structured in terms of the relationship and past interactions between Co-worker A and Co-worker B.\n\n1. The first sentence in MEMORY about overcoming fears and creating earrings doesn't directly correlate with the dialogue context regarding having a supportive boss or the specific events mentioned (e.g., the rabbit incident).\n\n2. The MEMORY does mention working on a project together and the rabbit incident, which aligns with Co-worker B's mention of working on a movie and the support provided during emotional times. This indicates some continuity and development of past interactions.\n\n3. The second part of the MEMORY about relaxation techniques and a hobby could be connected to the idea of emotional management discussed in the context, but it's not very strongly linked to the exact events in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\n4. The third segment of MEMORY highlights the incident with the dynamite and the need for emotional management, which is directly mentioned in the context, making it more relevant.\n\nOverall, while there is relevant information present, and some continuity in relation to past interactions is shown, the information could be structured in a more coherent way to provide a clearer development of events and connection between the speakers' past interactions. The mix of relevant and less relevant information leads to a medium score of 3."
