Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I need to talk to you about something important.\nClassmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\nClassmates A: I know about your affair with that other woman.\nClassmates B: What are you talking about? I don't have an affair with anyone.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B have a good relationship, with Classmates A expressing admiration for Classmates B's intelligence and sense of humor. This admiration has led to both Classmates A and B enjoying talking to each other and considering themselves great study partners. As a result, they are excited about seeing Lady Gaga in concert and are looking forward to singing and dancing along to her hits.\n\n2. Classmates A has developed a crush on Classmates B, which Classmates B finds flattering. In response, Classmates B is considering taking biology classes in college to learn more about how the body works. Meanwhile, Classmate A is balancing high school and college classes to be successful and help their family.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some background on the relationship between Classmates A and B, which shows that they have a generally positive and friendly history. This could potentially add some context to the current tension in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as it suggests that the accusation of an affair is surprising given their past interactions. However, the information about their admiration for each other, study partnership, concert plans, and Classmates A's crush on Classmates B does not directly contribute to understanding the specific discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the mention of biology classes and balancing schoolwork seems unrelated to the current dialogue and does not help in generating a response to the accusation of an affair. Overall, while the MEMORY shows some development of their relationship, it lacks direct relevance to the current conversation."
