Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today?\nCo-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing.\nCo-workers A: Do you need any help? I don't want you to get overwhelmed.\nCo-workers B: That's really nice of you, but I don't want to burden you with my work.\nCo-workers A: It's not a burden if it's something I can do to support you. Plus, helping you out makes me feel good too.\nCo-workers B: You're right, thank you. You always go above and beyond to help me out.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B supports and encourages Co-worker A to prioritize their health. This leads to Co-worker B feeling glad that Co-worker A is okay. Additionally, Co-worker B is impressed with Co-worker A's well-thought-out plans for their partnership. \nCo-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A, resulting in Co-worker A being grateful for the assistance. Subsequently, Co-worker B is pleased with the outcome of their trade and acknowledges that their skills complement each other well.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about the supportive nature of the relationship between the co-workers, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Co-worker A offers assistance to Co-worker B. The mention of Co-worker B's support and encouragement towards Co-worker A aligns with the current dynamic of mutual aid and appreciation. However, the MEMORY focuses more on previous instances of help from Co-worker B to Co-worker A, whereas the current context is about Co-worker A offering help.\n\nWhile the sentences are connected and demonstrate a supportive relationship, the causality and development of events are not entirely clear in relation to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it specifically provided insights into Co-worker A's previous support actions or instances where Co-worker B accepted help before.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY gives a moderate amount of helpful information but could be improved for greater contextual alignment and clarity on past interactions that directly relate to the specific offer of help in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
