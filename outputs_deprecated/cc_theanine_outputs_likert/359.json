Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Coach, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nAthlete: Ted Athlete unrolls the map. He looks at it for a few moments before tracing his finger along one of the highways. \"This is our route,\" he says finally, feeling in control.\nCoach: What route are you planning, Ted?\nAthlete: I'm thinking of taking the highway through the mountains, it's a bit longer, but the scenery is beautiful.\nCoach: That sounds like a good plan, as long as we factor in enough time for rest stops and breaks.\nAthlete: Yes, I was thinking we could stop at a few rest areas along the way. It's important to stay hydrated and keep our energy levels up during long drives.\nCoach: Definitely. Speaking of energy levels, how's your nutrition plan been going? Have you been keeping up with eating healthy foods like those bean sprouts we talked about?\nAthlete: Yes, Coach. I've been incorporating more nutrient-dense foods like bean sprouts into my diet. And I've noticed a significant improvement in my overall energy levels and performance on the field.\n\nMEMORY:\nThe Coach advises the athlete on pre-game meals, emphasizing the need for a balance of carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats, as well as staying hydrated. Both the Athlete and Coach emphasize the importance of small changes in diet impacting performance.\nThe Coach encourages the athlete to continue their good work with nutrition and training, which causes the Athlete to take on more responsibilities and gain respect from other players.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions the Coach's advice on nutrition, which directly relates to the dialogue's discussion about the athlete's nutrition plan and the inclusion of bean sprouts in the diet. The MEMORY also highlights the importance of diet changes on performance, which aligns with the athlete noting improved energy levels and performance. Moreover, the MEMORY notes how the athlete has taken on more responsibilities and gained respect from peers, which suggests a development in the athlete's journey, aligning with the supportive dynamic reflected in the dialogue context. Overall, the connections and development in the MEMORY are clearly demonstrated, providing helpful contextual cues for generating the next response."
