Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Student, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn.\nTeacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation?\nStudent: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle.\nTeacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time?\n\nMEMORY:\nThe student emphasized the importance of being aware of surroundings and acting quickly in emergencies, feeling rewarded by the experience. The teacher and student have a positive and understanding relationship. \nThe teacher encouraged the student to prioritize safety and continue helping others in need, causing the student to mention feeling stressed lately, which may have led to the outburst. The student has already made plans with their daughter and son-in-law to visit more often and take the grandkids on trips. \nThe teacher expressed understanding and encouraged the student to seek help when needed, which made the student already make plans with their daughter and son-in-law to visit more often and take the grandkids on trips.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about the enjoyment and challenges of spicy food. The information in the MEMORY primarily focuses on other topics such as safety awareness, feeling stressed, and plans with family. While it mentions a positive relationship between the teacher and student, which might be somewhat helpful, it lacks clear relevance and natural connection to the current dialogue about spicy food and building a tolerance. The MEMORY is not particularly structured in a way that benefits generating a relevant next response based on the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
