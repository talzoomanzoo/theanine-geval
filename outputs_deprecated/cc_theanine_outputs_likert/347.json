Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I just gave my boss the written report. I hope she finds it helpful.\nCo-workers B: Did you make sure to include all the necessary details?\nCo-workers A: Yes, I made sure to cover everything we talked about in the meeting. I even added some extra information that I thought could be useful.\nCo-workers B: That's smart thinking. It shows that you're invested in the company and want to make sure things run smoothly.\nCo-workers A: Thanks. I learned a lot from taking over the family business. It taught me the importance of being efficient and proactive.\nCo-workers B: I remember you telling me about that. It's amazing how much you've accomplished since then.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A's father was hesitant to hand over the business but now trusts Co-worker A. This experience taught Co-worker A the importance of being efficient and proactive.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information that provides context for Co-workers A's statement in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about learning efficiency and proactivity from taking over the family business. The memory effectively complements Co-worker A's explanation by adding depth to the reason they hold these values, as it highlights the father's initial hesitation to hand over the business and how this contributed to Co-worker A's development. This connection enhances understanding of Co-worker A's background and motivations, which is valuable for generating a proper response in continuation of the dialogue. However, the memory's utility is limited to adding background information and does not directly influence the immediate discussion about the report or the interaction with the boss, which prevents it from receiving a perfect score."
