Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I know you know something about my past. Can you tell me what it is?\nClassmates B: I'm sorry,, but I can't disclose that information. It's not my place to tell.\nClassmates A: But how did you find out? I haven't told anyone.\nClassmates B: Let's just say I have my ways of finding out things. But don't worry,, it's nothing bad or embarrassing.\nClassmates A: Okay, but it's still bothering me that you know something about me that even my closest friends don't know.\nClassmates B: I understand how you feel, but sometimes it's best to keep certain things to ourselves. Trust me, it's for your own good.\nClassmates A: I guess you're right. But if I ever feel comfortable enough to share, will you promise not to tell anyone else?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A was nervous about fitting in but saw Classmates B as well-liked and wanted to be friends with them, which made Classmates A believe in the power of positivity and its impact on life.\n2. Classmates B's warning to Classmates A about the potential danger of dark alleys was in the same topic as advising Classmates A to be careful and aware while on the bus.\n3. After the conversation, Classmates B is open to trying to be more optimistic and encourages Classmates A to keep striving towards their goals.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some details about past interactions between Classmates A and B, but they are not directly relevant to the ongoing conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The first memory provides insight about Classmates A's nervousness and admiration for Classmates B, which could potentially explain the level of trust and discomfort A feels regarding B's knowledge of their secrets. The second memory suggests a protective behavior from B towards A, which is somewhat aligned with B's role in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as a confidant who is keeping information for A's own good. The third memory about B's encouragement to A lacks a direct connection to the current discussion about A's past secrets. Overall, while these memories provide some context for the relationship dynamics, they do not directly aid in generating a response to the immediate conversation topic about disclosure and trust."
