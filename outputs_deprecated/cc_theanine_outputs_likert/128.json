Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I'm the boss!\nCo-workers B: Yeah, we know. You don't have to remind us every five minutes.\nCo-workers A: I just want everything to go smoothly and according to plan.\nCo-workers B: I understand that, but it doesn't always have to be your way or the highway.\nCo-workers A: Well, I just think that my way is usually the best way.\nCo-workers B: And sometimes it is, but we all have different ideas and perspectives to bring to the table.\nCo-workers A: Okay, I see your point. I'll try to be more open-minded in the future.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Co-worker A enjoys helping others and takes pride in their work, which leads to Co-worker A and Co-worker B excelling at working well with others and resolving issues. This results in Co-worker A giving Co-worker B a massage to help them relax.\n- Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace. Similarly, both Co-worker A and Co-worker B value communication and understanding in relationships, as well as enjoy taking moments to connect with each other to make work more enjoyable.\n- Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace, causing them to have a disagreement. However, they resolve it and become friends again, with Co-worker A returning Co-worker B's watch a few years ago being the cause of their rekindled friendship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Co-workers B",
    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate that. It's important to consider different viewpoints to find the best solution for everyone involved.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a proper next response. It highlights the personal dynamics between Co-workers A and B, indicating that they have a history of working well together and valuing communication. This aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Co-worker B advocates for considering different ideas and perspectives. However, not all sentences in MEMORY are effectively connected or relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, details such as Co-worker A giving Co-worker B a massage and specific past events like returning a watch are not directly useful in understanding the dialogue's context. While the MEMORY offers some insights into the relationship, the details provided are not consistently linked to the current conversation, resulting in a moderate score."
