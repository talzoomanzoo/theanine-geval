Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Teacher, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn.\nTeacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation?\nStudent: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle.\nTeacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time?\nStudent: Really? Maybe I should try to build up my tolerance then.\nTeacher: It could be worth a try. Speaking of trying new things, how's your language studying going?\nStudent: It's going pretty well. I started with French, but now I'm considering taking up Spanish and German too. I want to become more well-rounded.\nTeacher: That's a great goal. Have you thought about any specific ways you could use your language skills?\nStudent: I would love to be able to travel more and speak with the locals in their native language. Maybe I could even teach my grandchildren some basic phrases.\n\nMEMORY:\nThe student wants to become more well-rounded by studying French at college and plans on learning Spanish and German as well. The teacher speaks Spanish and French fluently.\nThe teacher's encouragement to prioritize safety and continue helping others in need caused the student to mention feeling stressed lately, which may have led to the outburst. The student has already made plans with their daughter and son-in-law to visit more often and take the grandkids on trips.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a wonderful plan! Learning new languages opens up so many opportunities for connection and exploration.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information about the student's language studies, such as their desire to become more well-rounded by studying multiple languages, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, it adds unnecessary information about the teacher's language proficiency, which is not immediately relevant to the current conversation. Additionally, it introduces unrelated details about the student's stress, family plans, and past interactionsâ€”none of which contribute clearly to the context of spicy food, language learning, and aspirations in travel and teaching languages. This lack of causality and relevancy in the MEMORY sentences limits their helpfulness in generating an appropriate next response, and they aren't clearly phrased to distinguish as non-beneficial either."
