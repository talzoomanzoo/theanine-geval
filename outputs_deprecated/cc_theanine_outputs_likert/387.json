Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Husband, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway?\nWife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go?\nHusband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city.\nWife: Oh, that sounds like a perfect idea! It will be nice to have some peace and quiet for a change.\nHusband: Yes, and we could cook our meals together, go for a hike, and just relax. What do you think?\nWife: That sounds lovely, husband. I'm really looking forward to it.\n\nMEMORY:\nThe husband is excited about his progress on long-awaited plans and is putting in a lot of effort to make them a reality. This excites him and makes him want to commit even more to his plans. The husband and wife are committed to each other and excited about their future together. \n\nThey discussed setting specific times for updates on progress and waiting for each other for certain events to avoid similar situations. This discussion was caused by the husband's long-awaited plans and his action towards them.\n\nThe wife supports the husband's goals but wanted to be involved in them. This support from the wife makes both the husband and wife supportive of each other's dreams and aspirations.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about the husband's long-awaited plans and suggests a strong commitment between the husband and wife, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where the husband proposes a getaway plan. However, the MEMORY lacks specific information regarding past interactions related to getaways, vacations, or spending quality time together. The MEMORY mentions the wife's support for the husband's goals and his excitement, which are helpful in understanding their relationship dynamic. However, the memory could be more directly relevant to the immediate context of planning and excitement about a getaway. The structure of the memory is coherent and portrays the commitment and support in their relationship, which is helpful, but could have been more directly useful with more specific linkage to the current context of planning for the getaway."
