Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today?\nCo-workers B: No, you didn't. What did you do there?\nCo-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done.\nCo-workers B: That's good. I hate going to the post office. It's always so crowded.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it was pretty busy today. But I needed to get this package sent out.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of packages, remember that time when you got stranded because you couldn't drive yourself home from a night out with friends?\nCo-workers A: Ugh, don't remind me. That was such a disaster.\nCo-workers B: It was definitely not one of your finest moments. But it's good to see that you're being responsible now and taking care of things like sending packages.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A is trying to improve their punctuality and cut back on drinking, in an effort to be more responsible and avoid late nights out and expensive rides. Both co-workers show a supportive and caring attitude towards each other, with Co-worker B being supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life. Co-worker A recently moved to a new duplex with two floors, having their bedroom on the first floor and another room on the second floor, indicating that Co-worker A and their ex have both moved on from the breakup.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically regarding Co-worker A's attempts to improve their responsibility. This aligns with the conversation about Co-worker A sending a package and being responsible, as well as the reference to Co-worker A being stranded because of past irresponsibility. The MEMORY also reflects the supportive dynamic between Co-workers A and B, which is evident in their current interaction. However, the detail about Co-worker A's new living situation seems somewhat extraneous to the context of the dialogue about responsibility and the post office. The sentences are naturally structured and connected, allowing the language model to easily discern relevant details from potentially less relevant ones. Overall, the MEMORY helps to generate a coherent response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
