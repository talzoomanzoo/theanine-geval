    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit.\nNeighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water.\nNeighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it.\nNeighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again.\nNeighbors A: I won't. So, do you remember the time when I mowed the lawn with that old push mower?\nNeighbors B: Yeah, I remember that. That was pretty tough work.\nNeighbors A: It was. But it was also a good workout.\nNeighbors B: I prefer to work out indoors where there's air conditioning.\nNeighbors A: Ha, I remember when I took off my jacket and put my feet up in your armchair. It was so warm that day.\nNeighbors B: Yeah, that was a hot day. I'm glad you felt comfortable in my home though.\nNeighbors A: You know, I really enjoy spending time with you. I want to get to know you even better.\nNeighbors B: I feel the same way. We should plan something fun to do together.\nNeighbors A: Absolutely. Hey, do you remember when I ripped off the tag from my shirt?\nNeighbors B: Yeah, your mom was pretty upset about that.\nNeighbors A: I didn't think it was a big deal, but she sure did. Do you ever have disagreements like that with your parents?\nNeighbors B: Sometimes, but not often. We have a pretty good relationship.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A and Neighbors B have not seen each other in a while and are catching up. They plan to hang out once a week, possibly watching a movie, getting coffee, or just talking. Neighbors A and Neighbors B are both neighbors who have known each other for years and have become good friends. Neighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for a while, as they reminisce about past events.\n\nBoth Neighbors A and B enjoy spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn. They both agree to start this weekend and are looking forward to it. Neighbors A and B are on friendly terms and enjoy spending time together. Neighbor A enjoys spending time in Neighbor B's cozy home and wants to hang out more often.\n\nNeighbors A and Neighbors B are on friendly terms and enjoy spending time together. They plan to hang out once a week, possibly watching a movie, getting coffee, or just talking. Neighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Neighbors A",
    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad we have a good relationship with our parents overall. It's important to have understanding and respect.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the fact that Neighbors A and B are on friendly terms, enjoy spending time together, and have known each other for years. This provides context for their conversation and supports the idea that they have a close, casual relationship. Additionally, the mention of spending time outside doing chores like mowing the lawn aligns with the dialogue context, where they reminisce about using the old push mower. However, the memory redundantly states their plan to hang out once a week multiple times, and it introduces new and not entirely relevant details such as bringing extra water for mowing the lawn and options of watching a movie or getting coffee. These elements do not directly contribute to generating the next response based on the specific dialogue presented. Overall, the MEMORY contains relevant details but could be more concise and tailored to the current context."
