Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today.\nClassmates B:  That sounds great. What was the talk about?\nClassmates A: It was about the history of the pyramids in Egypt. I learned so much about their construction and the cultural significance they held.\nClassmates B: Wow, that does sound interesting. Did you take any notes?\nClassmates A: Yes, I took lots of notes. I'm excited to study this topic more on my own time.\nClassmates B: That's awesome. It's great to see your enthusiasm for learning.\nClassmates A: Thanks. I've always been passionate about learning new things. Remember when we talked about how determined I was to get into college?\nClassmates B: Yeah, I remember. You were always studying and taking extra classes.\nClassmates A: And now, after all that hard work, I am actually in college. It just goes to show that with dedication, you can achieve your goals.\nClassmates B: That's so inspiring. It also reminds me of when you wore your pajamas to school. You were always doing something different and unique.\nClassmates A: Haha, yeah, I remember that. But hey, being a little weird sometimes adds some fun and excitement to life. Speaking of exciting things, I met the girl of my dreams a couple of years ago at a party.\nClassmates B: Aww, that's fantastic. How has everything been going with her?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. [Classmates A struggled with motivation but found a way to stay focused by thinking about the payoff of their hard work.] - (React) - [Classmates A is willing to work hard to achieve their dreams.]\n2. [Classmates A is also working on an essay about the Industrial Revolution.] - (React) - [Classmates A struggled with motivation but found a way to stay focused by thinking about the payoff of their hard work.] - (SameTopic) - [Classmates A feels like everything is falling into place and is excited to see where the new relationship goes.]\n3.

    "speaker": "Classmates A",
    "raw_prediction": "Things have been going really well with her. I feel like everything is falling into place, and I'm excited to see where this new relationship goes.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which helps understand the ongoing conversation between classmates A and B. The MEMORY contains details that are pertinent to the context, such as Classmates A's motivation, their hard work ethic, and the funny moment recalled by Classmate B, which is quite directly mentioned in the context related to wearing pajamas to school. It also hints at Classmates A's current involvement in a new relationship, which aligns with the context's mention of meeting the girl of their dreams. The sentences are well-structured and convey causality and development in their past interactions, but there are some parts that may not be directly useful for generating the next response in this particular context, such as the essay on the Industrial Revolution or Classmate B's history project. However, overall, the MEMORY contributes considerable helpfulness by connecting to multiple elements of the conversation."
