Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message.\nCo-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of skills, you always present a compelling argument in debates. I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive.\nCo-workers A: Yes, I think it's important to back up your claims with facts and figures. It helps to convince the judge or the audience that you're right.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of convincing people, have you ever been in a physical altercation before?\nCo-workers A: Yes, unfortunately. But that doesn't mean I'm a danger to people. I just don't back down from a fight when I'm standing up for what's right.\nCo-workers B: That's understandable. Speaking of standing up for what's right, do you remember when you asked Karen for money and she was hesitant at first?\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I remember. But she eventually gave me the cash, and I was able to take care of what I needed to.\nCo-workers B: That's good. And speaking of taking care of things, your carpentry skills are amazing. I loved the house you built for me last year.\nCo-workers A: Thanks! I really love building houses. It's a great feeling to take a blueprint and turn it into someone's dream home.\nCo-workers B: You're a true professional. Speaking of professional skills, your speech at the rally really moved the crowd. You have a great way with words.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B is interested in Co-worker A's carpentry skills and praises the house built for them. \nCo-worker B praises Co-worker A for standing up for their beliefs and mentions how their reputation may have affected Karen's initial hesitation to give money. \nCo-worker A's confidence in their argument is evident from collecting evidence for a case and presenting it persuasively in front of a judge, despite denying any influence on Karen's decision to lend money.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you, I appreciate that. It's always fulfilling to see how words can inspire and motivate others.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a good amount of helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memory effectively summarizes Co-worker B's interest in Co-worker A's carpentry skills, their praise for Co-worker A's ability to stand up for their beliefs, and their confidence in making a persuasive argument during a court case. It also nicely ties these points together, helping to elucidate the key elements from the conversation, such as Co-worker A's skills and actions impacting their interactions (e.g., potentially influencing Karen's hesitation to lend money). The sentences are naturally structured, providing a clear understanding of the past interactions and developments between the speakers. However, it could be slightly more explicit in emphasizing the connections or developments related to the dialogue context."
