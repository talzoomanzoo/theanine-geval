Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager!\nCo-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge.\nCo-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail.\nCo-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of new products, remember when you used to fantasize about being a great leader?\nCo-workers A: Ha, yeah. That seems like ages ago.\nCo-workers B: Well, now you can finally take on that leadership role and make your dreams a reality.\nCo-workers A: That's true. It's amazing how life works out sometimes. But it hasn't always been smooth sailing. Remember when I was really stressed about you not liking me?\n\nMEMORY:\n1.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides useful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It accurately reflects Co-worker A's past interactions and aspirations to be a great leader, which connects to the current context of A's promotion and fulfillment of those aspirations. Additionally, the memory mentions a past stress related to their relationship, tying into the dialogue where A recalls a time when they were concerned B might not like them. The structure of the MEMORY aids in understanding the dynamics and development of their relationship. However, some aspects, such as advising on emotion control, are not directly relevant to the conversation at hand, slightly diminishing the helpfulness of the MEMORY."
