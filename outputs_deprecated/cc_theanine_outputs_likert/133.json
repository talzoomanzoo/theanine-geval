Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I'm the boss!\nCo-workers B: Yeah, we know. You don't have to remind us every five minutes.\nCo-workers A: I just want everything to go smoothly and according to plan.\nCo-workers B: I understand that, but it doesn't always have to be your way or the highway.\nCo-workers A: Well, I just think that my way is usually the best way.\nCo-workers B: And sometimes it is, but we all have different ideas and perspectives to bring to the table.\nCo-workers A: Okay, I see your point. I'll try to be more open-minded in the future.\nCo-workers B: That's all we can ask for. Remember that we're a team and we all have something valuable to contribute.\nCo-workers A: You're right. I'm glad we can have these conversations and work towards being better together.\nCo-workers B: Me too. Speaking of working together, do you remember when you gave me back my watch a few months ago? That meant a lot to me.\nCo-workers A: Of course I remember! I'm happy we're friends again.\nCo-workers B: Me too. And do you still have that baby doll and rattle you bought a couple of years ago?\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A is known for being competent and trusted with important projects, just like how Co-worker A and Co-worker B excel at working well with others and resolving issues. This ability allows them to enjoy moments connecting with each other, making work more enjoyable.\n\nCo-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact on the workplace, similar to when Co-worker A returned a watch to Co-worker B, repairing their friendship. This act of kindness from Co-worker A a few months ago led to the rekindling of their friendship, proving the value of their bond.\n\nCo-worker B thought they had lost the watch for good, but thankfully Co-worker A returned it. On a related note, Co-worker A used to carry a teddy bear gifted by their grandma everywhere, showcasing sentimental value in personal items.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Co-workers A",
    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I still have them. They hold a special place in my heart.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It reinforces the idea of Co-worker A being competent and having a positive influence in the workplace, which aligns with Co-worker A's insistence on things going smoothly. MEMORY also emphasizes the rekindling of a friendship through an act of kindness (returning a watch), which is relevant to the conversation where Co-worker B expresses gratitude for that action. Additionally, the mention of Co-worker A's sentimental attachment to a teddy bear adds depth to Co-worker A's character, complementing the line about the baby doll and rattle in the context. However, the MEMORY could be improved by being more concise and providing only pertinent information directly relating to the ongoing dialogue, as there are some extraneous details not directly linked to the immediate interaction. Hence, it does not completely align with the highest score."
