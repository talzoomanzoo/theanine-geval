Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Wife, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway?\nWife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go?\nHusband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city.\nWife: Oh, that sounds like a perfect idea! It will be nice to have some peace and quiet for a change.\nHusband: Yes, and we could cook our meals together, go for a hike, and just relax. What do you think?\nWife: That sounds lovely, husband. I'm really looking forward to it.\nHusband: Great. I'll start looking for rental cabins right away. I know this may sound impulsive, but I'm really excited to make this happen.\nWife: Don't worry, husband, it's not impulsive. You always follow through with your plans, and I believe this will be a wonderful experience for both of us.\nHusband: Thank you, wife. And, I want to apologize for the time I left without waiting for you. I know I promised to wait, and I should have kept my word.\nWife: It's okay, husband. I understand that you were in a hurry, and it wasn't intentional. Besides, that was a long time ago, and we've moved past it.\nHusband: Thank you for being so understanding, wife. I just want to make sure I am not repeating the same mistake again.\nWife: I trust that you won't, husband. And hey, remember when I stopped a runaway carriage from causing harm to a group of people? That was quite the adrenaline rush!\nHusband: Oh, I remember that, wife. You are fearless, and I'm so proud of you.\nWife: Thanks, husband. And speaking of good times, I had so much fun at the dance a few weeks ago. Dancing with you always puts me in a good mood.\nHusband: Same here, wife. I love spending time with you, and I feel grateful for every moment we get to share. \n\nMEMORY:\nThe husband's dedication to his dreams fuels his excitement and determination to turn them into reality, which strengthens the bond and commitment between him and his wife. \n\nThe wife's unwavering support and belief in her husband lead to his realization of the importance of keeping promises and involving her in his plans, especially after a past incident where he left without waiting for her.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant context that is helpful for generating a next response. It summarizes the dynamics between the husband and wife, highlighting the husband's dedication to his plans and the wife's support, which are themes present in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memory offers insight into how their interactions have developed over time, especially mentioning the husband's recognition of the importance of keeping promises â€” a detail that aligns well with the dialogue context where he apologizes for an old mistake. While the MEMORY does not incorporate every specific detail from the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, it is naturally connected and reflective of the relationship dynamics at play, making it quite helpful for generating an appropriate response. However, it lacks some specificity that would make it a perfect 5; for example, it could mention specific events (like the dance) to be even more relevant."
