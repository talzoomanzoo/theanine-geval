Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Mentor, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, have you ever tried to imagine what it would be like to think like someone else?\nMentor: Yes, I have. It's a great way to better understand and empathize with others.\nMentee: That's exactly what I thought. I've been trying to imagine what personY is thinking lately. It's been helping me to understand their perspective a bit better.\nMentor: That's a great approach. Putting ourselves in someone else's shoes can help us see things from a different angle and see where they're coming from.\nMentee: Exactly. And it also helps me to be more compassionate towards them. I think it's important for us to be more understanding and supportive of each other, especially in difficult times.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentee is taking the idea of teaching religion seriously and wants to make a positive impact on people's lives. This approach helps Mentee to be more compassionate and understanding towards others, especially in difficult times.\n2. Mentee is currently living in an abusive and controlling cult. Mentor suggests Mentee volunteer at a local church or religious organization to gain experience, aiming to make a positive impact and be supportive of others. This is why Mentor became a mentor, to help those in similar situations.\n3. Mentee is currently living in an abusive and controlling cult. Mentee agrees to teach in a way that allows people to make their own decisions about their beliefs, influenced by Mentor's advice and support.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains information that may be related to the Mentee's intention to understand others and be compassionate, as seen in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the details about the Mentee living in an abusive and controlling cult, as well as plans to teach religion as a way to impact others positively, do not directly influence or support the specific conversation about imagining others' perspectives. The MEMORY lacks explicit connections to the current topic of empathy and understanding others' thoughts. The sentences about teaching religion and learning from the Mentor could hypothetically align with the overarching theme of understanding and supporting others, but they are not naturally phrased or structured to indicate their relevance to the ongoing dialogue. As a result, they provide limited useful context for generating the next response. Overall, the MEMORY contains useful context, but it does not clearly develop or relate to the CONVERSATION CONTEXT, hence a lower score of 2."
