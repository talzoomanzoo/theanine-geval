Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B showed a willingness to assist others by helping a customer resolve an issue last week. This demonstrates Co-worker B's supportive nature and readiness to help in any way. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it, similar to when they spoke with the police about an incident where the women involved were thankful. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time. \nCo-worker B commended Co-worker A for their bravery and willingness to help, leading Co-worker A to try to stay positive and focus on their recovery despite it being a daunting task. Co-worker B admires Co-worker A's resilience and positivity, describing them as someone who can stay optimistic even in challenging situations, such as the accident where they lost their hands and feet.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "**Helpfulness Score: 3**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information, but it is not all directly beneficial or clearly connected to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The following points can be considered:\n\n1. **Relevant Information**: \n   - The fact that Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it is directly referenced by Co-worker A in the dialogue context. This memory is relevant as it ties to Co-worker A's mention of guilt over borrowing the pencil, providing context for Co-worker A's behavior and guilt.\n\n2. **Other Memory Details**:\n   - The description of Co-worker B's supportive nature and willingness to help others, as well as Co-worker B's reaction to the pencil incident, is generally insightful for understanding Co-worker B’s character but does not directly contribute much to resolving the current conflict about Co-worker A's extreme plan.\n   - The mention of Co-worker A’s bravery, resilience, and positivity related to an accident where they lost their hands and feet is significant background information, though it seems only indirectly related to the immediate dialogue situation.\n\n3. **Structure and Naturalness**:\n   - While the sentences are fairly straightforward, they mix various unrelated events and character descriptions, which together may not provide a coherent or causal understanding that could specifically help further this particular conversation about personal boundaries and ethical behavior.\n\nConsidering these aspects, the MEMORY can assist the language model to some extent but lacks direct strong connections and coherency tailored to the dialogue context related to Co-worker A’s current ethical dilemma. Thus, a score of 3 is appropriate."
