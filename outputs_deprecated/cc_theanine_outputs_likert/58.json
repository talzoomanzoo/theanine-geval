Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today?\nCo-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing.\nCo-workers A: Do you need any help? I don't want you to get overwhelmed.\nCo-workers B: That's really nice of you, but I don't want to burden you with my work.\nCo-workers A: It's not a burden if it's something I can do to support you. Plus, helping you out makes me feel good too.\nCo-workers B: You're right, thank you. You always go above and beyond to help me out.\nCo-workers A: That's what co-workers are for. We're a team and we need to support each other.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of teamwork, remember when you showed me your plans for the future a few months ago? I'm still excited about the idea of working on a project together.\nCo-workers A: Me too! I think we would make a great business partnership.\nCo-workers B: Definitely. It's great to have someone I can trust and rely on in both work and personal matters.\nCo-workers A: I agree. We have a good working dynamic and I'm happy to help out whenever I can.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B is impressed with Co-worker A's well-thought-out plans for their partnership and encourages Co-worker A to prioritize their health.\n\nCo-worker A feels motivated about the future and is excited to work with Co-worker B, which causes Co-worker B to be glad to have been able to help Co-worker A and feel the trade worked out well for both of them.\n\nCo-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A, leading to Co-worker A offering Person Z to Co-worker B in exchange for one of their horses and expressing gratitude for the joy and happiness the horse brings.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY contains elements that are somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, especially in terms of expressing co-worker support and mutual encouragement. The first sentence highlights Co-worker B's impression of Co-worker A's plans, which aligns with the dialogue where Co-worker B is excited about their partnership. The second sentence mentions the positive feeling and motivation about future work, reflecting the enthusiasm seen in the dialogue. However, the third sentence diverges significantly from the context, introducing unrelated elements like the exchange involving a horse and Person Z, which doesn't tie back to the ongoing conversation about workload and teamwork. While the first two sentences contribute to understanding the supportive dynamic, the third sentence detracts from the overall helpfulness, as it does not align with the dialogue and introduces extraneous details. Overall, the MEMORY provides some contextually helpful information but lacks full coherence and contains off-topic elements."
