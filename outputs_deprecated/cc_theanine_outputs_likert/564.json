    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, how are you feeling today?\nClassmates B: I'm feeling frustrated. I wish I could do things on my own.\nClassmates A: I understand how you feel. It can be tough when you feel like you're dependent on others.\nClassmates B: Yeah, exactly. I don't want to be a burden on anyone.\nClassmates A: You're not a burden, don't worry. And I'm always here to help you out.\nClassmates B: I appreciate that, but I don't want to always rely on others. I want to be more independent.\nClassmates A: I get it. Maybe there are some small things you can do on your own to start feeling more independent?\nClassmates B: Like what?\nClassmates A: Well, maybe you can start by making a list of things you'd like to do on your own and we can work on achieving those goals together.\nClassmates B: That sounds like a good idea. Thanks for understanding, Classmates A.\nClassmates A: Of course, I'm always here to support you. Hey, speaking of goals, remember when we talked about your guitar playing a few months ago? How's that going?\nClassmates B: It's going really well, thanks for asking! I've been practicing every day and I feel like I'm getting better.\nClassmates A: That's awesome! Have you thought about joining a band or playing gigs around town?\nClassmates B: Not really, I'm still a bit nervous about performing in front of people.\nClassmates A: I get it, performing can be scary. But maybe in a few months, we can work on setting a goal for you to do a small performance somewhere.\nClassmates B: That sounds like a challenge, but also kind of exciting. I'm in!\nClassmates A: Great, I'm looking forward to seeing you rock out on stage. Hey, remember when we talked about your new car a few hours ago? How's that going?\nClassmates B: I'm loving it! It's so much fun to drive. Thanks for asking, Classmates A.\nClassmates A: No problem, glad to hear it. Hey, I remember a few months ago when you talked about being reminded of your childhood and feeling emotional. How are you feeling about that now?\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates A and B enjoy jamming together and plan to collaborate on music in the future. They have a friendly and supportive relationship, as evidenced by their conversation about their respective experiences. \nClassmates A enjoys reminiscing about childhood memories, particularly about playing on swings and making music with friends. \nClassmates B finds it awesome that Classmates A is pursuing their passion for music after a conversation they had about following dreams. Classmates B recently bought a red sports car and finds driving it to be fun and freeing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I still have those moments, but I've been focusing on the present and trying to create new memories. It's been helping me move forward.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains sentences that provide helpful context for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It reinforces the supportive relationship between Classmates A and B, which is evident in the dialogue as they discuss personal goals and achievements. Specifically, MEMORY mentions their shared interest in music and plans to collaborate, which aligns with the discussion about Classmates B's guitar playing and potential future performance. The MEMORY also highlights Classmates B's enjoyment of their new car, which reflects the dialogue where Classmates A asks about it. \n\nWhile not every sentence in MEMORY is directly related to the current dialogue turn (such as childhood memories unrelated to current activities), they are phrased in a way that smoothly conveys background information, demonstrating a clear connection and development of past interactions. This makes MEMORY generally useful for understanding the context and dynamics between the classmates, assisting in generating further responses that maintain the tone and flow of their conversation."
