    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Can you believe it? I'm a millionaire now!\n\nMEMORY:\n- Neighbors B is supportive and believes Neighbors A's story, suggesting looking up UFO sightings in the area. This leads to Neighbors A feeling tired from work and needing to catch up on sleep. Neighbors B has been supportive of Neighbors A's job search, offering to connect them with people in different industries, which caused Neighbors A to make a big career change recently and be much happier now.\n\n- Neighbors A plans to do some research and possibly report the sighting of the UFO, then suggests planning something else to do together over the weekend. This makes Neighbors A want to start looking for new opportunities soon, updating their resume and starting networking, after they took the leap to make a change and are glad they did.\n\n- Neighbors B is supportive and believes Neighbors A's story, suggesting looking up UFO sightings in the area, and this is in the same topic where Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's decision and admires the courage it took.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some background information about Neighbors A and B's interactions, but it lacks clarity and relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY mentions Neighbors B supporting Neighbors A's job search and the decision to make a career change, which offers some context about their relationship. However, it doesn't directly relate to Neighbors A becoming a millionaire, thus limiting its helpfulness for generating the next response. Additionally, there's repetition and lack of focus on past interactions directly relevant connecting to the mindset suggested by someone who just became a millionaire, which would have made it more helpful."
