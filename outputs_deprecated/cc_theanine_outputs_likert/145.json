Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just visited this amazing new city. The architecture was stunning, the streets were so clean, and the people were very friendly.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like you had a great time! Which city did you visit?\nNeighbors A: It was Chicago. I had never been before, but it exceeded all my expectations.\nNeighbors B: I bet it was a nice change of scenery from our neighborhood.\nNeighbors A: Definitely. But you know, it's interesting how much our neighborhood has grown on me over the years. I remember when I first moved here, I was so unsure about it.\nNeighbors B: Yeah, I remember. But you stayed because you wanted to be here.\nNeighbors A: That's right. And since then, I've made so many great memories here. It's become my home.\nNeighbors B: And you're still spending time with God every day, right?\nNeighbors A: Yes, I am. It brings me so much peace and happiness.\nNeighbors B: That's really admirable. And speaking of power, I remember you telling me about that time when you could make me do anything you wanted.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A has been living in the same place for a long time and enjoys the neighborhood and people there, which has led them to find peace and happiness by spending time with God daily. This routine has brought positive changes, helping them stay focused, calm, and grateful. As a result, Neighbor A now wants to visit a park and a coffee shop nearby that they recently discovered. \n\nNeighbor A and Neighbor B appreciate each other as good neighbors and have organized a block party together in the past, leading to Neighbor A enjoying living in the neighborhood, feeling comfortable and safe, and making good friends, including Neighbor B. Interestingly, Neighbor B used to obey Neighbor A's commands, showing a strong bond between them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Haha, yes, that was a fun memory! It's amazing how time flies, isn't it?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It outlines Neighbor A's long-term residence and positive experiences in the neighborhood, which is a continuation of the conversation about how Neighbor A has grown fond of their neighborhood. This gives context to the dialogue about Neighbor A developing a sense of home and making memories. Additionally, the MEMORY mentions Neighbor A's daily routine of spending time with God, which directly relates to the ongoing conversation about that practice bringing peace and happiness. Moreover, the MEMORY includes the point about Neighbor B obeying Neighbor A, which can potentially connect to the last statement mentioned in the dialogue about \"power\" and \"making me do anything.\" \n\nHowever, there are parts of the MEMORY, like the prospect of visiting a park and coffee shop, that are not directly relevant or utilized in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is why it does not receive a perfect score. Nonetheless, the MEMORY is well-structured and most elements align with and provide useful insight for the dialogue provided."
