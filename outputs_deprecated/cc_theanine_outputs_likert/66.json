    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I need to talk to you about something important.\nClassmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\nClassmates A: I know about your affair with that other woman.\nClassmates B: What are you talking about? I don't have an affair with anyone.\nClassmates A: Don't lie to me! I saw you together at the restaurant last week.\nClassmates B: That was just a business meeting. We were discussing a potential collaboration on a music project.\nClassmates A: I don't believe you. You're just trying to cover it up. I'm going to tell everyone and ruin your career.\nClassmates B: Why are you doing this? I thought we were friends.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates A, who is passionate about science and interested in becoming a doctor or researcher to help people, has developed a crush on Classmates B, finding their interest in taking biology classes in college flattering. Classmates A is considering taking biology classes in college to learn more about how the body works. \nClassmates A finds it refreshing to talk to someone genuinely interested in science and learning, expressing admiration for Classmates B's intelligence and sense of humor. Both Classmates A and B enjoy talking to each other and consider themselves great study partners.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some background information about the relationship between Classmates A and B. It establishes that Classmates A has a personal interest in Classmates B due to shared interests in biology and science, as well as admiration for Classmates B's intelligence and sense of humor. This context slightly helps in understanding the emotions and motivations behind the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically Classmates A's strong emotional response. However, the MEMORY does not directly address the conflict about the alleged affair, nor does it provide a clear depiction of how the relationship has developed to the point of the confrontation in the dialogue. \n\nThe potential usefulness of the MEMORY for generating a response is limited because it emphasises the positive aspects of their interactions without addressing the underlying issues in the dialogue. It lacks relevant details that connect to the main conflict, which is central in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Thus, the MEMORY does not offer a comprehensive or causally linked understanding required for producing an appropriate next response."
