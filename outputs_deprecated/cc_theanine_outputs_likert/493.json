Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I just finished my computer course, and I learned so much about using computers effectively.\nClassmates B: That's great! What did you learn specifically?\nClassmates A: Oh, a lot of things. I learned how to use different programs and software for different tasks, and how to choose the right one depending on what I need to do.\nClassmates B: Do you have any software recommendations for me? I always struggle with choosing the right program.\nClassmates A: It really depends on what you need the software for. But for basic tasks like word processing or spreadsheet management, I would recommend Microsoft Office. It's user-friendly and versatile.\nClassmates B: Thanks, I'll keep that in mind. Did you learn anything else in the course?\nClassmates A: Yeah, I also learned some basic coding languages like HTML and CSS. It was challenging but really interesting.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Classmates A appreciates having friends who are there for them during difficult times, especially when Classmates B supported Classmates A through a tough time by listening to them.\n- Classmates A got grounded for a week for kicking a door and causing damage, which hindered the friendship dynamics between Classmates A and Classmates B, who used to dance a lot in middle school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains information about the personal dynamics between Classmates A and B, but it is not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on learning from a computer course and software recommendations. The personal anecdotes about supporting each other during difficult times and past incidents contribute little to generating a response related to the current conversation about computer skills and software, resulting in a low helpfulness score. Additionally, the sentences about past interactions are not structured in a way that clearly relates to the ongoing dialogue, making it difficult for a language model to easily use this information to generate a helpful response."
