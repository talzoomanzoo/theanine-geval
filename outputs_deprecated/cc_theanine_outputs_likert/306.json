Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I marked the boundary line with a pen on the wall so that we can both be clear about where my property ends and your property begins.\nNeighbors B: Oh, okay. I didn't realize there was any confusion about that.\nNeighbors A: Well, I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page. I don't want any misunderstandings in the future.\nNeighbors B: I understand. Is there anything else we should do to make sure we're clear about this?\nNeighbors A: I don't think so, but if you have any other suggestions, I'm open to hearing them.\nNeighbors B: No, I think the line is a good idea. It's clear and simple.\nNeighbors A: Great. Hey, speaking of lines and boundaries, remember when we talked about my promotion at work? I had to set some clear boundaries with my team about what I expected from them.\nNeighbors B: Yeah, I remember. How did that go?\nNeighbors A: It was tough at first, but eventually, everyone respected the boundaries I set and our team was more productive because of it.\nNeighbors B: That's great to hear. It's important to set boundaries and stick to them if you want to be successful in any area of your life.\nNeighbors A: Absolutely. And hey, on a related note, I wanted to talk to you about something else. Lately, I've been feeling really overwhelmed and stressed out.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A's favorite book is \"The Great Gatsby.\" - (Cause) - Neighbor B was read to from a book about personal development by Neighbor A, which had a positive impact on Neighbor A's career growth. - (Cause) - Neighbor A feels like they are making a real impact at the company and is driven and motivated. - (Changed) - Neighbor A is feeling overwhelmed and stressed, mentioning having a lot on their plate.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY partially aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and provides some helpful information for generating a proper response. The MEMORY includes the detail that Neighbor A is feeling overwhelmed and stressed, which directly connects to the last exchange in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Neighbor A mentions feeling overwhelmed. This is relevant as it can guide Neighbor B's response to address and support Neighbor A's current feelings. \n\nHowever, other parts of the MEMORY, such as Neighbor A's favorite book or the positive impact of a book on personal development, aren't directly useful for continuing the specific conversation about boundaries and stress. Although these parts of the MEMORY offer some background information, they don't contribute to developing the ongoing dialogue on setting boundaries or dealing with stress effectively. Therefore, the memory includes a mix of useful and less relevant information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, justifying a middle score of 3."
