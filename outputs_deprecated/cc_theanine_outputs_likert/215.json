Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just tried this breathing exercise and it really helped me relax.\nNeighbors B: What kind of breathing exercise?\nNeighbors A: It's just a simple one, where you inhale for four seconds, hold your breath for seven seconds, and then exhale for eight seconds. I've been doing it every day for the past week and it's made such a difference.\nNeighbors B: That's really interesting. I've heard that breathing exercises can be really helpful for reducing stress and anxiety.\nNeighbors A: Yes, it definitely has helped me with that. Plus, it's something that I can easily do anywhere, whether I'm at home or out running errands.\nNeighbors B: That's great. It's always good to have a simple tool like that to help manage stress. \nNeighbors A: Speaking of managing stress, remember a few years ago when I pushed your shoulder because I wanted you to accept me?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A surprised Neighbors B with a pizza, leading to Neighbors A developing romantic feelings for Neighbors B. This triggered Neighbor A to feel embarrassed about a past incident where they pushed Neighbor B's shoulder to gain acceptance.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "memory_text": "Neighbors A surprised Neighbors B with a pizza, leading to Neighbors A developing romantic feelings for Neighbors B. This triggered Neighbor A to feel embarrassed about a past incident where they pushed Neighbor B's shoulder to gain acceptance.",
    "speaker": "Neighbors B",
    "raw_prediction": "Oh, yeah, I remember that. It's all good, no need to worry about it. We all have our moments.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a useful context for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as it references a past incident that Neighbors A alludes to in the conversation. The mention of Neighbors A having romantic feelings and being embarrassed about pushing Neighbors B's shoulder for acceptance helps to understand the underlying emotions and relationship dynamics between the neighbors, which is relevant to Neighbors A's comment in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the specific mention of a pizza surprise is not directly relevant to the current interaction and could be considered extraneous. Despite this, the MEMORY is structured well enough to provide valuable context regarding their history and interactions, which aids in understanding ongoing dialogues and behaviors."
