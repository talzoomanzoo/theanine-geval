Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: Child, I have a new project that I've been working on.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Child feels it is unfair that they have to do certain chores because the Parent is too tired. The Parent expresses a desire to be a better role model for the Child and their siblings. The Child is caring and offers help to the Parent.\n   \n2. The Parent is working and feels tired after a long day. The Parent emphasizes the importance of being aware of surroundings and being careful while driving or walking. This is because the Parent mentions a terrible accident they witnessed on the way to the Child's school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY contains two different past interactions between the Parent and Child. In the first memory, the Child is described as feeling burdened by chores, yet offers help to the Parent who wants to be a better role model. This suggests a supportive dynamic and could inform how the Parent approaches discussing their new project. However, the connection between this past interaction and the current dialogue context is relatively weak.\n\nThe second memory records an instance of the Parent emphasizing awareness due to an accident they witnessed. While this might provide context for the Parent's concern for safety, it does not directly relate to the Parent's announcement of a new project.\n\nOverall, the memories provide some helpful background about the Parent-Child relationship, particularly hinting at the Child's helpfulness and the Parent's values, which are slightly relevant to the current context of introducing a new project. However, the linkage between the memories and the current discussion could be stronger to provide a higher score."
