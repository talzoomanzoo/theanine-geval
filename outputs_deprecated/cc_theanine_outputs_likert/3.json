Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life.\nChild: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you.\nParent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you.\nChild: Did you feel like that when you were in detention? Like nobody was really listening to you?\n\nMEMORY:\n- The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations, which causes them to mention making mistakes in the past and trying to turn their life around.\n- The Parent and Child plan to watch the sunrise together in the future, and the parent suggests repeating the sunrise-watching tradition on a future weekend.\n- The Child finds the Parent's story inspiring and is supportive and proud of their parent for making changes, offering help and reassurance if needed.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I did feel that way at times, but I learned the importance of listening and being heard through those tough experiences. It's something I try to remember every day.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as it reflects the relationship between the Parent and Child, highlighting past interactions such as the Parent's efforts to turn their life around, which connects to themes of listening and support. Moreover, the Child's support and pride in the Parent suggest a strong bond where listening plays a significant role, aligning with the current theme of listening's importance. However, some details, like planning to watch the sunrise, aren't directly relevant to the ongoing conversation, slightly reducing the usefulness for generating a contextually appropriate next response. Overall, while the memory captures the supportive dynamics that could influence the Parent's responses, the direct connection to the current dialogue about listening could be stronger."
