Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: It's great to have friends who can help each other out, isn't it?\nNeighbors B: Absolutely. It's a two-way street, and it's important to be there for each other.\nNeighbors A: I remember when I helped you move last year, and then you watched my cat when I went on vacation.\nNeighbors B: Yes, and I appreciate it so much. It's always nice to have someone you can count on.\nNeighbors A: That's true. And speaking of which, I'm helping another friend move next weekend. It'll be a big job, but I know they'd do the same for me.\nNeighbors B: That's great. And if you need any help, just let me know.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A thanked Neighbors B for the suggestion of a new necklace and stumbled upon Neighbors B's shop. Neighbors B offered to help Neighbors A with the apology process.\nNeighbors A bought a necklace from Neighbors B's shop and loves it. Neighbors A has a picture of the dress on their phone and will show it to Neighbors B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains information about past interactions between Neighbors A and Neighbors B, specifically involving a necklace and a shop. However, this information does not appear to have a direct connection to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on the mutual help between friends, including experiences like moving and pet sitting. The MEMORY does not seem to provide relevant or meaningful context that would assist in generating a proper next response in the ongoing conversation. While the sentences are naturally phrased, they do not offer much in terms of development or causality related to the dialogue. The score remains modest because the memory is coherent and provides some insight into previous interactions, even though it lacks pertinence to the current context."
