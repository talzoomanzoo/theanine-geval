Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to share something with you. I helped out a neighbor in need over the weekend.\nClassmates B: That's really kind of you. What did you do to help?\nClassmates A: She was moving and needed some extra hands to pack up her things and load them onto a truck. So I spent most of the day helping her out.\nClassmates B: Wow, that's really generous of you. I'm sure your neighbor really appreciated it.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates A appreciates Classmates B's efforts and support, which is why they are looking forward to hanging out outside of school. This mutual appreciation has led to both of them wanting to spend time together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Classmates A",
    "raw_prediction": "Thanks, she was really grateful for the help. It felt good to make a difference.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a general sentiment of mutual appreciation and desire to spend time together between Classmates A and B, which is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It implies a warm and supportive relationship, which aligns with the positive interaction seen in the dialogue. However, it lacks specific details or context about past interactions directly related to the current conversation. The connection is shown, but the development isnâ€™t very detailed, leaving some room for improvement. Hence, this MEMORY is rated a 3 for providing a moderate degree of helpfulness in terms of contextual understanding."
