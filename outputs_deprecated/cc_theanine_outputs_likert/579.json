Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination.\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off.\nNeighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks?\nNeighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else.\nNeighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location?\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home.\nNeighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become.\nNeighbors A: You're right, I need to stop making excuses and just get it done. Thanks for the advice.\nNeighbors B: No problem. Speaking of goals, how's the house project coming along? \nNeighbors A: It's finished! Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard. It was a lot of work, but worth it in the end. \nNeighbors B: That's amazing, thanks for building me such a beautiful house. \n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A's enjoyment of building houses and finishing them quickly led to helping Neighbor B build a new house with amazing features. This action caused Neighbor B to remind Neighbor A of their potential to do good things, specifically referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them. As a result, Neighbor A wants to believe that plants need sunlight, water, and love to thrive.\n\nNeighbor A's project of building a new house for Neighbor B with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard caused them to help Neighbor B build a new house with amazing features. This experience changed Neighbor A's perspective on building the new house, finding it challenging but ultimately rewarding.\n\nNeighbor A's enjoyment of building houses and finishing them quickly has led them to also enjoy taking care of flowers and finding it calming.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad you're enjoying the new house. I've actually started working on a new project - I'm trying my hand at growing a garden. It's been quite relaxing.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information, specifically related to the house project that Neighbor A completed for Neighbor B. This is mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Neighbor A confirms the completion of the house project with specific details about the house. However, the MEMORY is somewhat repetitive and includes details that are not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Neighbor A's enjoyment of taking care of flowers. Additionally, some sentences are structured awkwardly, making it difficult to clearly understand the development of past interactions. Overall, while there is useful information, the MEMORY could be more concise and focused on the relevant aspects of the conversation."
