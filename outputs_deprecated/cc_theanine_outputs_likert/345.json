Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I just gave my boss the written report. I hope she finds it helpful.\nCo-workers B: Did you make sure to include all the necessary details?\nCo-workers A: Yes, I made sure to cover everything we talked about in the meeting. I even added some extra information that I thought could be useful.\nCo-workers B: That's smart thinking. It shows that you're invested in the company and want to make sure things run smoothly.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A believes the project will be approved with flying colors because Co-worker A made changes to modernize processes and invest in new technology for the business.\n2. Co-worker B appreciates the pen and thanks Co-worker A for the gesture, similar to how Co-worker A took over the family business and made changes to adapt to modern times.\n3. Co-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen as a thoughtful gesture, which is a result of Co-worker A taking over their family's business a few years ago and improving it since then.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains some information regarding Co-worker A's work ethic and innovative mindset, which might be slightly helpful in understanding the motivation behind the detailed report Co-worker A submitted to their boss. However, the MEMORY primarily focuses on Co-worker A's previous actions related to modernizing processes and a personal gesture involving a pen, which are not directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about submitting a report. There is limited clear connection or development of interactions between the two co-workers in relation to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the sentences are not naturally structured to clearly convey past interactions in a way that would be helpful in generating the next response in the dialogue. Thus, the MEMORY rates lower on the helpfulness scale."
