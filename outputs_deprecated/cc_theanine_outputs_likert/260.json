Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend!\nCo-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while.\nCo-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing?\nCo-workers A: I sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites.\nCo-workers B: That's such a beautiful song. You have a great voice.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! It was really nerve-wracking, but I'm glad I did it.\nCo-workers B: I'm sure the audience loved it. You've really got some talent.\nCo-workers A: Thanks again. It's just something I do for fun, but it's nice to know people enjoy it.\nCo-workers B: Definitely. It's great to have a hobby like that. Reminds me of when you uncovered that mystery a while back. You always seem to surprise us with your skills.\nCo-workers A: Haha, yeah. I do like a good challenge. Speaking of surprises, remember when I found out you were married? That was a shocker.\nCo-workers B: Oh gosh, yes. I forget sometimes that not everyone knows. But yeah, I've been married for a few years now.\nCo-workers A: Crazy how time flies. Like when we found out Ms. Singh was leaving our school. I still can't believe that was two years ago.\nCo-workers B: I know, right? She was such a great teacher. Speaking of which, have you heard anything about her lately?\nCo-workers A: Not really. I think she moved to another state, but I'm not sure where.\nCo-workers B: Ah, okay. Well, hopefully she's doing well wherever she is. But hey, getting back to your solo, I think you should definitely do it again sometime.\nCo-workers A: Really? You think so?\nCo-workers B: Absolutely. You've got a gift, and it would be a shame not to use it.\n\nMEMORY:\n[Co-worker A and Co-worker B are excited about payday and being able to pay off bills.] - (React) - [Co-worker A suggests celebrating their detective work with drinks after work.]\n[Co-worker A discovered that an employee was hiding clothes to sell on the side.] - (SameTopic) - [Co-worker A is observant and did some research on social media to find out that Co-worker B is married.]\n[Co-worker B mentions that their store is getting new inventory next week, specifically a new line of athletic wear.] - (Want) - [Co-worker A enjoys solving puzzles and mysteries, even considering becoming a detective.]\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks, I appreciate the encouragement. Maybe I'll consider singing more often.",
    "prediction": "The helpfulness score for the MEMORY can be rated as follows:\n\nHelpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY does contain some information that could potentially aid in understanding the interactions between Co-worker A and Co-worker B. For instance, it elaborates on Co-worker A's knack for detective work and surprises, which ties back to the dialogue context where Co-worker B mentions being surprised by Co-worker A's solo performance and detective skills. Additionally, the MEMORY highlights Co-worker A's past detective work regarding Co-worker B's marriage, directly aligning with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT discussion about surprising and discovering that Co-worker B was married.\n\nHowever, some portions of the MEMORY do not provide direct relevance or enhancement for generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Examples include the mention of payday and paying off bills, or the store's new inventory, as these are not directly related to the current conversation about singing, surprises, or past interactions between the coworkers.\n\nThe overall structure of the MEMORY is naturally phrased but could benefit from more focused content that relates more directly to the singing, surprising, and shared history discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Thus, while helpful, the MEMORY lacks comprehensive coherence with the dialogue making it more limited in facilitating an ideal next response from Co-worker A."
