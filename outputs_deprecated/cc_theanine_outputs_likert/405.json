Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Why is your face so red and splotchy, Classmates B? Did you get sunburned?\nClassmates B: No, I didn't get sunburned. I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed.\nClassmates A: Embarrassed? Why?\nClassmates B: It's nothing, really. Just something embarrassing happened to me earlier.\nClassmates A: Come on, tell me! I won't judge you, I promise.\nClassmates B: Well, I accidentally spilled my lunch all over myself in front of some people.\nClassmates A: (laughs) That's it? That's why you're embarrassed? I thought it was something serious.\nClassmates B: (sighs) Yeah, it's silly. But still embarrassing.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A praised Classmates B for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space, showing mutual admiration for each other's strengths.\n2. Both classmates value supporting and uplifting each other in their learning and growth, with Classmates A helping Classmates B out of friendship and belief in mutual support.\n3. Classmate B praises Classmate A's attention to detail and work ethic as truly impressive, while Classmate A emphasizes the importance of hard work and dedication in skill improvement.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some information about the past interactions between Classmates A and B, highlighting the mutual admiration, support, and appreciation they have for each other. However, these details are not directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on Classmate B's embarrassment due to an incident involving spilling lunch. While the MEMORY demonstrates the positive dynamics and supportive relationship they have, it lacks specific past interactions related to feelings of embarrassment or similar situations that could aid in generating a more contextually relevant response. The MEMORY is naturally phrased and provides a general understanding of their relationship, but it falls short in directly supporting the immediate dialogue scenario."
