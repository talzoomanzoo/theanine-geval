Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, have you noticed how strong I've become?\nNeighbors B: Wow, you do look very strong! Have you been working out?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A emphasized the importance of taking care of trees and the environment for future generations, showing their concern for the environment. Neighbors B values their friendship with Neighbors A and wants to ensure it remains strong, offering help and support in times of need.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I've been hitting the gym regularly. It feels good to stay active.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses on Neighbors A's physical strength and fitness, while MEMORY discusses environmental concerns and the value of friendship. Although it provides some background on Neighbors B's supportiveness, it lacks any connection or development that would help generate an appropriate next response to the current conversation about fitness. The sentences in MEMORY are naturally structured, but they do not clearly relate to the context of physical strength being discussed, thus offering limited helpfulness for generating the next response."
