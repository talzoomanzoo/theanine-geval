Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Child, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: Child, I have a new project that I've been working on.\nChild: What is it, Parent?\nParent: I created a website where I post advertisements, and people can pay to see them.\nChild: Oh, that's interesting. How does it work?\nParent: Well, I create the ads myself, and then I post them on my website. People who want to view the ads can pay a small fee, and then they can see them.\nChild: Do you think people will pay to see your ads?\nParent: I don't know yet, but I hope so. I've put a lot of effort into creating some eye-catching ads.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Parent and Child have open communication about various topics, including a past accident and the parent's willingness to contribute more to household chores, which led to the Parent seeing a doctor and taking medicine for their illness.\n2. The Child suggests creating a schedule for chores to ensure everyone contributes equally, and the Parent expresses a desire to be a better role model for the Child and their siblings, along with considering adopting more children, preferably younger ones aged 2 to 5, which the Child supports hoping for a happy home for them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a creative project, Parent. I hope it goes well for you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about the relationship and past interactions between the Parent and Child, focusing on open communication and discussions about responsibilities and family dynamics. However, the specific details in the MEMORY (like the accident, chore schedule, role modeling, and adopting children) do not appear directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is centered around the Parent's new project involving a website and advertisements. The MEMORY does not provide significant helpful information that would aid in generating a response to the current conversation about the project. It might be slightly beneficial in understanding the communication style between the Parent and Child, but overall it's not directly useful for continuing the dialogue on the specific topic at hand."
