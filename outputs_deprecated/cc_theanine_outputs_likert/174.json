Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Child, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: Child, I have a new project that I've been working on.\nChild: What is it, Parent?\nParent: I created a website where I post advertisements, and people can pay to see them.\nChild: Oh, that's interesting. How does it work?\nParent: Well, I create the ads myself, and then I post them on my website. People who want to view the ads can pay a small fee, and then they can see them.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Parent expresses a desire to be a better role model for the Child and their siblings because the Parent agrees to make an effort to start pulling their weight around the house and to follow the chore schedule. The Child is caring and offers help to the Parent.\n   \n2. The Parent acknowledges being lazy about washing dishes and promises to contribute more to keeping the home clean because the Child feels it is unfair that they have to do certain chores because the Parent is too tired. The parent and child have open communication about various topics, including a past accident and the parent's willingness to contribute more to household chores. The Parent has seen a doctor and is taking medicine for their illness.\n\n3. The Parent witnessed a terrible accident while walking to work and was deeply affected by it because the Parent is working and feels tired after a long day. The Parent mentions a terrible accident they witnessed on the way to the Child's school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a creative way to generate income, Parent. Have you had many people interested in viewing the ads on your website?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides background information about the Parent's promise to be more involved with household chores and open communication with the Child about various issues, though it doesn't directly relate to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about the Parent's new project. Memory 1 and 2 show the Parent's willingness to become a better role model by engaging in family responsibilities, which could influence how the Parent's current project might also be framed as a positive, proactive aspect of their life to the Child. Memory 3 touches on emotional experiences but feels more disconnected from the specific context at hand. Thus, MEMORY offers some useful context about the relationship dynamics, which may influence the Child's perception or interest towards the Parent's new project, but it lacks a more direct connection to the topic of the new website specifically. The histories mentioned are well-structured and indicate the development of the Parent-Child relationship, which could provide subtle cues for how to approach the conversation."
