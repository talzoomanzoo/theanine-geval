    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, check out this spot I found to camp out for the night. It's perfect!\nClassmates B: Wow, this view is amazing!\nClassmates A: I know, right? And it's completely level and free of any debris. We won't have to worry about rolling off our sleeping pads or anything like that.\nClassmates B: It definitely looks like a great spot to spend the night. How did you manage to find it?\nClassmates A: Just a stroke of luck, I guess. I was exploring the area and stumbled upon it. It's always good to be a little adventurous and explore new places, you never know what you might find.\nClassmates B: That's true. You always seem to find the best spots. Like that time we went camping near the lake and had the whole place to ourselves.\nClassmates A: Oh yeah, that was a great spot too. It's always fun to explore and go on new adventures.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates A expresses a desire to find alternative ways to have fun and make a positive impact in the community, leading to their proactive and curious nature in researching topics of interest. This curiosity eventually results in Classmate A experiencing an allergic reaction with symptoms of itchy skin and a tight throat. \nClassmates B, admiring Classmates A's involvement in the community, emphasizes the importance of being cautious with allergies and taking necessary precautions to prevent severe reactions.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "We should definitely plan more camping trips like this in the future. It's always exciting to discover new hidden gems in nature.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a general insight into Classmate A's character, highlighting their proactive and curious nature. However, most of the memory content, such as Classmate A's allergic reaction and Classmate B's emphasis on caution regarding allergies, is irrelevant to the current camping context. While Classmate A's adventurous personality aligns with their behavior in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, the details about the allergic reaction do not contribute to generating an appropriate response in the given camping scenario. The lack of direct relevance and development pertinent to camping or finding a campsite limits the MEMORY's helpfulness."
