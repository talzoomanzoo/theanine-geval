Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just got back from my trip to South America. It was amazing!\nNeighbors B: Oh really? Where did you go?\nNeighbors A: I visited Brazil and Peru. The culture and food were incredible.\nNeighbors B: That sounds awesome. I've always wanted to go to Peru to see Machu Picchu.\nNeighbors A: Yes, Machu Picchu is amazing. The view from the top is breathtaking.\nNeighbors B: Have you thought about where you want to go next?\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I'm thinking about visiting Australia and Antarctica next. I want to see the Great Barrier Reef and the penguins.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A and B both believe in the importance of learning and self-improvement. This belief extends to doing nice things for others to bring the community together. Neighbors A and B took a cooking class together last year, which led them to value community involvement even more. Additionally, Neighbor B admires Neighbor A's organization skills and is inspired to enhance their own organization. In response, Neighbor A is open to taking precautions and being smart about their decisions.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Australia and Antarctica sound like incredible destinations! The Great Barrier Reef and the penguins would be amazing to see. Traveling really opens up your perspective, doesn't it?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some insight into the shared values and activities between Neighbors A and B, such as their belief in learning and community involvement, and that they took a cooking class together. However, these details do not have a direct connection or relevance to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT that is focused on travel experiences and future travel plans. The MEMORY lacks detailed references to past interactions or discussions between the neighbors that could enhance the language model's ability to generate a pertinent next response related to the conversation about travel. The information about Neighbor B admiring Neighbor Aâ€™s organizational skills and their intention to improve their own organization, as well as being smart about decisions, is also loosely connected and does not serve the immediate context of travel. Hence, MEMORY could be somewhat helpful by providing background information about the characters, but mostly lacks the specificity needed for the ongoing travel discussion."
