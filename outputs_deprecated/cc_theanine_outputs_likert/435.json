Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Mentor, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, have you ever tried to imagine what it would be like to think like someone else?\nMentor: Yes, I have. It's a great way to better understand and empathize with others.\nMentee: That's exactly what I thought. I've been trying to imagine what personY is thinking lately. It's been helping me to understand their perspective a bit better.\nMentor: That's a great approach. Putting ourselves in someone else's shoes can help us see things from a different angle and see where they're coming from.\nMentee: Exactly. And it also helps me to be more compassionate towards them. I think it's important for us to be more understanding and supportive of each other, especially in difficult times.\nMentor: I agree completely. It's important to be kind and compassionate towards others, especially when they may be going through something challenging.\nMentee: And I think it's also important to remember that we all have different perspectives and experiences that shape our thoughts and actions.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentee wants to teach religion to help people find meaning in their lives, and Mentee wants to make a positive impact in people's lives and is grateful for Mentor's support.\n2. Mentor advises Mentee to listen to their body, set a bedtime, and create a relaxing routine before sleep, and Mentor encourages Mentee to approach teaching religion with an open mind and heart.\n3. Mentee agrees to try the advice and express gratitude towards Mentor, which changed as Mentee is currently living in an abusive and controlling cult, and Mentor suggests Mentee volunteer at a local church or religious organization to gain experience.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely, recognizing and respecting the diversity of perspectives and experiences is key to fostering empathy and understanding in our interactions with others.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains some specific details about the mentor-mentee relationship and past discussions, such as Mentee's aspirations related to teaching religion and the mentor's practical advice about listening to the body. However, these details are not clearly connected or relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about empathy, understanding others' perspectives, and being compassionate. The memory lacks sentences demonstrating past interactions related to contemplating others' perspectives or emotional understanding. The information appears somewhat disjointed and not naturally structured to form a coherent link or development from past interactions based on the immediate context. Thus, while there is valuable information present, it doesn't align well with or support the dialogue flow, which is focused on understanding and compassion."
