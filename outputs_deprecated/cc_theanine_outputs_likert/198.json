Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager!\nCo-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge.\nCo-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail.\nCo-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of new products, remember when you used to fantasize about being a great leader?\nCo-workers A: Ha, yeah. That seems like ages ago.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B believes that Co-worker A has the potential to be a great leader if they use their power for good, and Co-worker A has aspirations of being a great leader and emphasizes the importance of communication. This aligns with Co-worker A's past fantasy of being a great leader and being respected and admired.\n\nCo-worker B encourages Co-worker A to consider pursuing a leadership position and highlights the qualities of a good leader, which resonates with Co-worker A's aspirations and emphasis on communication. This connects with Co-worker A's past fantasy of being a great leader and being respected and admired.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's amazing to see how far you've come since then. Your leadership skills have definitely shone through, and I'm sure you'll excel in this new role as a product manager.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information about Co-worker A's aspirations and Co-worker B's perception of Co-worker A's potential as a leader, which is directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Co-worker A was promoted to product manager. The MEMORY emphasizes Co-worker A's past desire to be a great leader, which ties into their recent promotion and the conversation they are having. It also mentions Co-worker B's encouragement and belief in Co-worker A's leadership qualities, resonating well with the support Co-worker B expresses in the conversation. Although the MEMORY includes some repetitive phrases, it nonetheless facilitates understanding of the dynamic between Speaker A and Speaker B, allowing for a coherent response to be generated."
