    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager!\nCo-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A has grown and become more confident over the years, which has led to considering taking on more responsibility at work as a start towards being a leader. Co-worker B acknowledges and supports Co-worker A's growth and progress, advising them to take small steps and have one conversation at a time. Both Co-workers emphasize the importance of supporting each other as co-workers.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information that aligns well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights Co-worker A's growth and readiness for more responsibility, which ties in directly with being promoted to product manager. It also shows Co-worker B's supportive role throughout Co-worker A's journey, reinforcing the context of mutual support. The MEMORY effectively showcases the development of the relationship between the two co-workers and provides context that would be beneficial in generating the next response. However, the sentences could be slightly more detailed or specific to ensure even clearer connections between past interactions and the current dialogue context."
