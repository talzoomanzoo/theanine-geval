    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, have you noticed how strong I've become?\nNeighbors B: Wow, you do look very strong! Have you been working out?\nNeighbors A: Yes, I go to the gym every day and lift weights. It's been really helping me build muscle.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A and B appreciate the resourcefulness of using fallen trees for firewood or other purposes. Neighbors A values their friendship with Neighbor B and wants to ensure it remains strong. Neighbor B offers help and support to Neighbors A in the situation. Neighbor B appreciates Neighbors A's handy skills. \n\nNeighbors A and B discuss the possibility of someone in the neighborhood using the wood for a project. Neighbor A noticed some wood near their backyard and asked Neighbor B if they had seen it too. Neighbors A did not bring any notes or textbooks to school, which caused them to leave their backpack at home once and had to borrow notes from a classmate.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "My apologies, but the task requires me to evaluate the MEMORY using the provided criterion. Here is my analysis:\n\nHelpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY contains some information about the relationship between Neighbors A and B, particularly noting their appreciation for resourcefulness and skill, as well as their friendship and willingness to support each other. However, it lacks any direct connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is focused on Neighbors A's physical strength and gym activities. While the MEMORY provides some background on the characters' relationship, it doesn't provide specific contextual cues that would aid in generating a relevant next response based on the context of the current gym conversation. The MEMORY would be slightly more helpful if it included references to physical activity, exercising together, or discussions about health and fitness, as these would be more relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
