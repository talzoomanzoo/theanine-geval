Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, have you noticed how strong I've become?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A and B appreciate the resourcefulness of using fallen trees for firewood or other purposes. Neighbor A values their friendship with Neighbor B and wants to ensure it remains strong. Neighbor A noticed some wood near their backyard and asked Neighbor B if they had seen it too. Neighbors A did not bring any notes or textbooks to school, causing them to leave their backpack at home once and had to borrow notes from a classmate. Neighbor A feels like they should have been more prepared for the test, which leads to them valuing double-checking before leaving the house.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, I've definitely noticed! You must have been putting in a lot of hard work.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some context on the relationship between Neighbors A and B, such as their appreciation for resourcefulness and Neighbor A's valuing of their friendship with Neighbor B. However, it fails to offer directly relevant information or clear causality related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Neighbor A is talking about becoming strong. The mention of firewood and fallen trees might be a vague connection to \"strength,\" but it is not directly useful. The other aspects of MEMORY, such as Neighbor A's experiences with school and being prepared, are not relevant and are poorly structured to connect to the context. Overall, the MEMORY lacks clear relevance and helpfulness for generating a next response related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
