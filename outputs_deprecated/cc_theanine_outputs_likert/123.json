Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I'm the boss!\nCo-workers B: Yeah, we know. You don't have to remind us every five minutes.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A's competence and reliability are recognized by Co-worker B, who appreciates their effort at work.\n2. Co-worker A's helpful nature and pride in work are reasons why Co-worker B sees them as competent and reliable, appreciating their effort.\n3. Co-worker A and Co-worker B repaired their friendship when Co-worker A returned a watch to Co-worker B, leading to a positive impact on the workplace.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provided offers some useful background information about the relationship and dynamics between Co-worker A and Co-worker B. Sentences 1 and 2 indicate that Co-worker B recognizes Co-worker A's competence, reliability, and pride in work which could explain the context where Co-worker A feels the need to assert their role as the boss. However, the way these sentences are structured makes them somewhat repetitive. Sentence 3 is slightly less relevant to the immediate DIALOGUE CONTEXT but could be useful in creating a more complete picture of the relationship between the two co-workers. Overall, the MEMORY includes valuable contextual information, but the connection to the current conversation is indirect, and some details are not directly aligned with the dialogue exchange."
