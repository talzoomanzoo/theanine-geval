    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Mentor, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends.\nMentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\nMentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Mentor has been guiding and supporting the Mentee in their work for years, which causes the Mentee to be offered a job and decide to take the job in the city.\n2. The Mentee hopes to inspire others to join the cause of gender equality and fighting discrimination, so the Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process, even though the Mentee is feeling overwhelmed with the college application process.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's completely normal to feel that way, Mentee. Building new friendships takes time, but I believe you'll find your place soon. Just keep being yourself and open to new experiences.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides some context that could help inform the Mentor's response. It indicates a longstanding, supportive relationship between the Mentor and Mentee, which could be useful for the Mentor to refer back to as a source of reassurance or encouragement. For instance, the Mentor could remind the Mentee of past challenges they've navigated together or use the history of their support to bolster the Mentee's confidence. However, neither memory sentence directly addresses the Mentee's current feelings of loneliness or difficulty making new friends, which are the focus of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Therefore, while MEMORY contains relevant contextual information about their relationship, its immediate helpfulness is limited concerning the specific issue being discussed (loneliness and connecting in a new city). Additionally, some parts of MEMORY regarding college applications and gender equality do not directly pertain to the current conversation, though they are naturally phrased and clearly differentiated."
