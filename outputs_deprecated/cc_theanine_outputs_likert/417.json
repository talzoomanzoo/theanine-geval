Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm really excited about finding a buyer for my product. I think it has a lot of potential.\nNeighbors B: That's great to hear, what kind of product is it?\nNeighbors A: It's a new type of workout equipment that's designed to be more efficient than traditional equipment. I've been working on it for months now and I really think it's going to take off.\nNeighbors B: Wow, that sounds interesting. Have you started looking for potential buyers?\nNeighbors A: Yes, I've been reaching out to various gyms and fitness centers to see if they'd be interested in carrying the product. I've even gotten some positive feedback from a few places.\nNeighbors B: That's awesome! I'm sure with your determination, you'll find the perfect buyer soon.\nNeighbors A: Thanks, I really appreciate your support. It's been a long road, but I'm confident that all my hard work will pay off.\nNeighbors B: Speaking of hard work, have you made any progress at your current job? I remember you were having some trouble with your boss.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A is taking responsibility for their actions and working on self-improvement, advised by Neighbors B to be more responsible at work.\n2. Neighbors B points out that Neighbors A's work attitude and behavior might be causing issues with their boss, leading Neighbors A to change and strive to be a better colleague.\n3. Neighbors B wishes for Neighbors A's success and stresses the significance of respect and effort at work, showcasing their supportive and friendly relationship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, things have been going much better at work lately. I've been putting in more effort and my boss has noticed the positive changes. I'm hoping to continue improving and show that I'm a valuable member of the team.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information about past interactions between Neighbors A and B, focusing on Neighbors A's work-related challenges and Neighbors B's support. This is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as Neighbors B inquires about Neighbors A's progress at their job, referencing previous difficulties with a boss. Additionally, the MEMORY suggests a supportive relationship, which aligns with the positive encouragement Neighbors B offers regarding the product venture. However, the MEMORY could be more directly helpful if it included specific details about Neighbors A's experiences with their job or product development that relate more closely to the dialogue context. While the MEMORY is naturally phrased and does outline general supportive interactions, it lacks specific points of development that directly enhance context comprehension, hence the rating of 3."
