    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Student, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn.\nTeacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation?\nStudent: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle.\nTeacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time?\nStudent: Really? Maybe I should try to build up my tolerance then.\nTeacher: It could be worth a try. Speaking of trying new things, how's your language studying going?\nStudent: It's going pretty well. I started with French, but now I'm considering taking up Spanish and German too. I want to become more well-rounded.\nTeacher: That's a great goal. Have you thought about any specific ways you could use your language skills?\nStudent: I would love to be able to travel more and speak with the locals in their native language. Maybe I could even teach my grandchildren some basic phrases.\nTeacher: Speaking of your grandchildren, how's your retirement planning going?\n\nMEMORY:\nThe student had a heroic experience at the beach where they helped save a young kid from drowning. This event made the student realize the importance of being aware of surroundings and acting quickly in emergencies. As a result, the student is looking forward to retirement and spending time with their grandchildren, expressing excitement about planning fun activities with them.\n\nThe teacher praised the student for their bravery and quick action in the emergency situation, offering support and reassurance for the student to talk about it. Additionally, the teacher encourages the student's retirement plans, emphasizing the importance of focusing on family during retirement.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information about the student's future plans and their grandchildren, which is related to the dialogue context where the student mentions teaching their grandchildren language phrases and the teacher asking about retirement planning. However, the main focus of the MEMORY on the beach incident and the student's bravery does not provide specific insight into the current conversation about spicy food, language learning, or retirement. Despite this, the MEMORY is structured well and intertwined with emotions and motivations, showing that these past interactions could be beneficial for the language model to understand the student's character and priorities. Thus, it is somewhat helpful but not directly linked to the main topics of the current dialogue."
