Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend!\nCo-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while.\nCo-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing?\nCo-workers A: I sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites.\nCo-workers B: That's such a beautiful song. You have a great voice.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! It was really nerve-wracking, but I'm glad I did it.\nCo-workers B: I'm sure the audience loved it. You've really got some talent.\nCo-workers A: Thanks again. It's just something I do for fun, but it's nice to know people enjoy it.\nCo-workers B: Definitely. It's great to have a hobby like that. Reminds me of when you uncovered that mystery a while back. You always seem to surprise us with your skills.\nCo-workers A: Haha, yeah. I do like a good challenge. Speaking of surprises, remember when I found out you were married? That was a shocker.\nCo-workers B: Oh gosh, yes. I forget sometimes that not everyone knows. But yeah, I've been married for a few years now.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A, known for their keen observation skills, found out through social media that Co-worker B was married, which came as a surprise to Co-worker B. \nCo-worker A uncovered that an employee was secretly selling clothes on the side, hindering Co-worker B's store inventory plans.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's always exciting to discover new things about people we work with every day. Your solo performance was definitely a pleasant surprise!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but lacks a clear, natural progression that connects the interactions specifically discussed in the context. The fact that Co-worker A discovered Co-worker B was married is explicitly mentioned in the dialogue, so this part of the MEMORY is clearly relevant and helpful. However, the second part about Co-worker A uncovering another employee's secret activity is only somewhat related, as it addresses Co-worker A's observation skills but doesn't directly influence the ongoing conversation. The sentence structure in the MEMORY is clear and logically connected, but its relevance is limited to only partially reflecting the events mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Therefore, the MEMORY would be most helpful if it expanded more on related and prior interactions or further explored the nature of their relationship."
