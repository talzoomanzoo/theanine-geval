Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I marked the boundary line with a pen on the wall so that we can both be clear about where my property ends and your property begins.\nNeighbors B: Oh, okay. I didn't realize there was any confusion about that.\nNeighbors A: Well, I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page. I don't want any misunderstandings in the future.\nNeighbors B: I understand. Is there anything else we should do to make sure we're clear about this?\nNeighbors A: I don't think so, but if you have any other suggestions, I'm open to hearing them.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A enjoys reading and sharing books with Neighbor B. This shared interest causes Neighbor A to believe in setting goals, developing a positive attitude, and taking action for personal development and career advancement. As a result, Neighbor A offers to help Neighbor B with getting into a workout routine. In response, Neighbor B offers to be more supportive and check in on Neighbor A more often. \nNeighbor A's favorite book is \"The Great Gatsby,\" which causes Neighbor B to admire Neighbor A's career advancement and express interest in borrowing the personal development book. Neighbor B's admiration leads Neighbor A to offer help with getting into a workout routine. Both neighbors then emphasize the importance of taking care of each other as neighbors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I think we've covered everything for now. I appreciate your proactive approach to avoid misunderstandings. Let's continue to communicate openly if anything comes up in the future.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful background information about the relationship between Neighbor A and Neighbor B. It tells us about their shared interest in reading, specifically in books like \"The Great Gatsby,\" which could have implications for their relationship dynamics. This shared interest may influence their interactions and the development of conversations between them, such as offering help with personal development and workout routines. However, the MEMORY does not directly tie into the specifics of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which concerns property boundaries. While the established rapport and mutual supportiveness could reflect the context of their dialogue about boundaries, the connection isn't explicitly mentioned or clearly developed. Therefore, MEMORY has some relevance to their interactions but lacks explicit ties to the current dialogue topic."
