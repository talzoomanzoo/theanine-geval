    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, how are you feeling today?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A is passionate about pursuing music and finds it rewarding. As a result, Classmates A and B enjoy jamming together and plan to collaborate on music in the future. They also have a friendly and supportive relationship, as evidenced by their conversation about their respective experiences.\n   \n2. Classmates A plays the guitar, takes lessons, and plays in a band. This leads to Classmates A and B enjoying jamming together and planning to collaborate on music in the future. Additionally, Classmates A enjoys reminiscing about childhood memories, particularly about playing on swings and making music with friends.\n\n3. Classmates A and B are both keeping up with the homework in their math class. Classmates B finds it awesome that Classmates A is pursuing their passion for music after a conversation they had about following dreams. This leads to them enjoying jamming together and planning to collaborate on music in the future. Furthermore, Classmates A enjoys reminiscing about childhood memories, particularly about playing on swings and making music with friends.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provided contains some useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly the aspect of a friendly and supportive relationship between Classmates A and B, which could influence their interaction in the current conversation. There are connections between Classmates A's passion for music and their interactions with Classmates B, suggesting they may discuss music-related topics frequently. However, the descriptions are somewhat repetitive across the three points, and not all sentences directly relate to how Classmates A might feel today, which limits the helpfulness in generating a direct response to the question in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the mention of their math class and childhood memories, while potentially relevant in a broader context, do not provide immediate cues for addressing the specific context of \"how are you feeling today?\" directly. Thus, while the MEMORY gives some insight into the dynamics and interests, it only somewhat aids in crafting a related response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
