Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Mentor, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, have you ever tried to imagine what it would be like to think like someone else?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentee has found a shelter for people who have been in abusive cults and is planning to escape there. Mentor suggests Mentee volunteer at a local church or religious organization to gain experience. Mentor became a mentor to help others going through similar situations.\n   \n2. Mentee expresses feeling suffocated and eager to leave the cult. Mentee has been thinking about helping others who may be in abusive cults.\n\n3. Both Mentee and Mentor agree to pack their things and get ready to leave without letting anyone know.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I believe it's important to try to understand different perspectives. It helps us empathize with others and see the world in a more compassionate way.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it mentions the Mentee's experiences and thoughts on escaping from a cult and the Mentor's background in helping others escape similar situations. This information could be helpful in framing a response that considers the Mentee's desire to think like someone else, possibly in the context of understanding other cult members or those they've helped. However, the sentences don't fully capture the development or causality between the Mentor and Mentee's interactions, nor do they directly address the concept of imagining oneself in someone else's mindset as posed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, while the MEMORY is relevant, it lacks connections between the individual sentences, making it less cohesive and informative as a whole."
