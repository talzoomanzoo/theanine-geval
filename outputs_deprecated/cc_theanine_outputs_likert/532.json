Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I can't believe I got caught cheating on my taxes. This is such a mess.\nClassmates B: Wait, what? You cheated on your taxes? That's not okay.\nClassmates A: I know, I know. I was just really struggling financially and I thought I could get away with it.\nClassmates B: You can't just cheat and hope to never get caught. That's not how it works.\nClassmates A: Remember when we talked about me wanting to become a professional basketball player?\nClassmates B: Yeah, I remember. So, what does that have to do with cheating on your taxes?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A practices basketball every day, both individually and with their team, and also does weight training to build strength. This is to help them pursue their dream of becoming a professional basketball player while working at a grocery store to save up money for training.\n   \n2. Classmates A has a big dream of becoming a professional basketball player and works hard towards that goal. They believe in hard work and dedication to achieve goals both in basketball and their job, maintaining a positive attitude towards their aspirations.\n   \n3.

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe memory provides some helpful information, especially in regards to Classmates A's goal of becoming a professional basketball player, which is mentioned in the dialogue context. The memories about Classmates A's dedication to practicing basketball and their goal-oriented attitude help establish the personal context and motivations of Classmates A, giving insight into the development of their character. However, the memory lacks a direct connection to the tax cheating incident discussed in the dialogue context. Although it exhibits the supportive dynamic between the classmates and reflects their personalities, it could benefit from clearer links to the current predicament discussed in the dialogue for it to be more helpful. The supportive aspect from Classmates B and the emphasis on hard work from Classmates A may be indirectly relevant by framing the broader context, but they don't directly assist in understanding the current conversation about tax issues. Therefore, the memory is somewhat helpful and naturally phrased, but not maximally relevant to the immediate context."
