    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Why is your face so red and splotchy, Classmates B? Did you get sunburned?\nClassmates B: No, I didn't get sunburned. I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A is stranded in space, running out of oxygen and feeling lightheaded. Classmate B admires Classmate A's attitude and sees it as a good example for others. Classmate A is patient and helpful in teaching driving material to Classmate B. Classmates B also mentioned that Classmates A helped them prepare for a driving test, showing patience and dedication.\n2. Classmates A expresses gratitude for Classmates B's support during the difficult situation. Classmate A feels that pushing themselves to do better helps them improve their skills and learn something new. Classmate A is patient and helpful in teaching driving material to Classmate B. Classmates B also mentioned that Classmates A helped them prepare for a driving test, showing patience and dedication.\n3. Classmates A is stranded in space, running out of oxygen and feeling lightheaded. Classmate B praises Classmate A's attention to detail and work ethic as truly impressive. Classmate A emphasizes the importance of hard work and dedication in improving skills.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several sentences about Classmates A and B's past interactions, but they are not particularly helpful or relevant in generating a next response to the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The DIALOGUE CONTEXT is focused on Classmates B's current embarrassment rather than any interactions related to driving tests, being stranded in space, or being helpful. There is no clear connection between the MEMORY and the current situation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as the memories mostly revolve around different topics that do not provide relevant cues for the context. While the sentences are naturally structured, they do not contribute meaningfully to the context of the conversation, thus earning a score of 2."
