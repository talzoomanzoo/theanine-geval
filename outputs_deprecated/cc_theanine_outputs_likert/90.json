    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I have some exciting plans for the future that I wanted to share with you.\nClassmates B: Oh really? What are they?\nClassmates A: Well, I was thinking that we could work on a project together and maybe even become business partners.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate A and Classmate B enjoy socializing and going out to parties together. They are open to meeting for coffee again in the future. Classmates A agreed to try the suggestion and thanked Classmates B for it. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n\n2. Classmate A and Classmate B enjoy socializing and going out to parties together. They are open to meeting for coffee again in the future. They have shared memories of buying coffee from Starbucks and enjoying it together.\n\n3. Classmate A and Classmate B enjoy singing karaoke together and look forward to future outings. They both plan to relax at home later in the day. Classmates B suggested meditation or breathing exercises to help Classmates A relax before bed, which causes Classmates A to consider talking to a therapist or counselor to address past issues.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great idea! I'm definitely interested in hearing more about it. Let's discuss how we can make it happen.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains general information about Classmates A and B's social activities and preferences, such as going to parties, enjoying coffee, and singing karaoke together. However, these memories do not effectively contribute to the dialogue's context of discussing exciting future plans and the possibility of working on a project together or becoming business partners. The memories lack specific detail or relevance that directly informs or enhances Classmate B's response related to the idea of collaboration or entrepreneurship mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While the memories provide some background information about shared activities, they are not particularly helpful in generating a relevant or enriched continuation of the conversation concerning future business collaboration. Thus, the score reflects the lack of direct connection and relevance to the given dialogue context."
