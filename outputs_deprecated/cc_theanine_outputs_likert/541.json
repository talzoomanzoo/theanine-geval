    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, check out this spot I found to camp out for the night. It's perfect!\nClassmates B: Wow, this view is amazing!\nClassmates A: I know, right? And it's completely level and free of any debris. We won't have to worry about rolling off our sleeping pads or anything like that.\nClassmates B: It definitely looks like a great spot to spend the night. How did you manage to find it?\nClassmates A: Just a stroke of luck, I guess. I was exploring the area and stumbled upon it. It's always good to be a little adventurous and explore new places, you never know what you might find.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A expresses a desire to find alternative ways to have fun and make a positive impact in the community, which leads to Classmates A being proactive and curious, taking the initiative to research topics of interest, and ultimately realizing that their current allergic reaction could be related to the previous discussion on allergies.\n\n2. Classmates A expresses a desire to find alternative ways to have fun and make a positive impact in the community, which leads to Classmates A agreeing to take better care of themselves in the future.\n\n3. Classmates B remembers Classmates A's previous involvement in community improvement projects and acknowledges their passion for making a difference, which leads to Classmate A realizing that their current allergic reaction could be related to the previous discussion on allergies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Being adventurous definitely pays off sometimes. I'm glad you found this perfect spot for us to camp out.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains information about Classmates A's involvement in community improvement projects and their proactive attitude, which might give some context about Classmates A's adventurous nature as mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the majority of the memory deals with past discussions about allergies and Classmates A's health, which are not directly relevant to the dialogue context about finding a great camping spot. Overall, the memory lacks direct connection and relevance to the current conversation, and the structure of the sentences does not effectively illustrate the development of past interactions related to the current dialogue. The natural structuring of memory sentences is minimal in helping to generate the next response for the given context."
