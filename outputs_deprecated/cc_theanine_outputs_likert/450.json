Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something.\nClassmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A offered to provide support and stress-relieving massages to Classmates B, which was appreciated. This led to Classmates A offering help and support to Classmates B, showing their compassionate nature.\n2. Classmates A had doubts about trusting Classmates B due to rumors about their reliability, but they discovered a secret that Classmates B has been keeping, leading to a moment where Classmate A admired Classmate B's courage and strength in sharing the secret.\n3. Classmates B assures Classmates A that they will do their part in the group project, which was appreciated by Classmates A, who tends to overthink things and struggles with feeling satisfied with their work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed with the upcoming group project. Do you think we could meet up to discuss our roles and plan things out together?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful information regarding the past interactions between Classmates A and B which could be helpful for generating a proper response. Details such as Classmates A offering support to Classmates B, Classmates B's assurance in a group project, and Classmates A's tendency to overthink are relevant to understanding their dynamic. However, the first and second memories contain somewhat disconnected events and do not establish a clear development related to the current conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Classmates A wants to discuss something particular. While the MEMORY contains relevant contextual data, it lacks a cohesive link to the current context of the dialogue, making it somewhat less informative for generating the next response."
