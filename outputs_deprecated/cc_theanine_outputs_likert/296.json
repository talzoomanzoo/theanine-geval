Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I marked the boundary line with a pen on the wall so that we can both be clear about where my property ends and your property begins.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A enjoys reading and sharing books with Neighbor B, which recently led to Neighbors A getting a new job as a secretary at a small marketing agency. This new job eventually caused Neighbors A to be promoted to manager and take on more responsibilities, leading to them feeling overwhelmed and stressed with a lot on their plate.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe memory mentions Neighbor A's enjoyment of reading and sharing books with Neighbor B and how it led to a new job, which indicates a possible past positive interaction between the neighbors. This background could, in some scenarios, contribute to understanding a respectful and communicative relationship between them, which might be relevant to resolving disputes like marking property lines. However, the link between the sharing of books and marking property lines in the dialogue context is not clear. The memory focuses more on A's career development, feelings of being overwhelmed, and stress, which don't directly inform the dialogue context about property boundary clarification or any relevance to their specific interaction about property lines. Therefore, this memory lacks direct helpfulness in constructing a relevant response in the given dialogue context and is mostly about tangential background information."
