Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Student, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn.\nTeacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation?\nStudent: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle.\nTeacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time?\nStudent: Really? Maybe I should try to build up my tolerance then.\nTeacher: It could be worth a try. Speaking of trying new things, how's your language studying going?\nStudent: It's going pretty well. I started with French, but now I'm considering taking up Spanish and German too. I want to become more well-rounded.\nTeacher: That's a great goal. Have you thought about any specific ways you could use your language skills?\nStudent: I would love to be able to travel more and speak with the locals in their native language. Maybe I could even teach my grandchildren some basic phrases.\nTeacher: Speaking of your grandchildren, how's your retirement planning going?\nStudent: It's going well. I'm really looking forward to spending more time with them and taking them on fun trips.\nTeacher: That sounds like a great plan. Speaking of fun, remember when you scared me in the hallway a few days ago?\nStudent: Oh, I'm so sorry about that. I was having a bad day and I shouldn't have taken it out on you.\nTeacher: No worries. Just remember, it's always better to talk things out calmly instead of yelling.\n\nMEMORY:\nThe teacher and student have a positive and understanding relationship. They emphasize the importance of effective communication, problem-solving, and talking calmly to find solutions together.\nThe student felt rewarded by the experience of being offered support and reassurance by the teacher. The teacher advises the student on being aware of surroundings, acting quickly in emergencies, and prioritizing safety.\nThe student appreciated the teacher's support and apologized for yelling in the hallway. They acknowledge it was out of character and seek to move past it by seeking help when needed.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for understanding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT because it captures the positive and understanding relationship between the teacher and student. It highlights the student's appreciation for the teacher's support and their plan to move past any conflicts by seeking help. This aligns with the dialogue context where the student apologizes for scaring the teacher in the hallway. Additionally, the MEMORY emphasizes the importance of effective communication and problem-solving, which is relevant to the dialogue where they discuss working through conflicts calmly. \n\nHowever, the MEMORY includes some information that does not match the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as advising the student on being aware of surroundings, acting quickly in emergencies, and prioritizing safety. These elements are not present in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which slightly detracts from its overall relevance.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY effectively provides context for the student-teacher relationship, which can help a language model generate a suitable next response. The structured nature of the MEMORY allows for recognizing essential cues in the dialogue, which justifies a score of 4."
