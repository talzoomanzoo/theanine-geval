Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Mentee, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends.\nMentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\nMentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here.\nMentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people.\n\nMEMORY:\n- The Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace. Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process, feeling overwhelmed with the college application process, and took shoes from the store without paying because they couldn't afford them.\n- The Mentor has been guiding and supporting the Mentee in their work for years, causing the Mentee to be offered a job and deciding to take the job in the city.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does not effectively help generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences in the MEMORY are not directly related to the current conversation about Mentee feeling lonely in a new city. They do not provide significant contextual cues or information relevant to the current problem of making new connections in a new environment. \n\nThe references to the college application process, stealing shoes due to financial constraints, or taking a job in the city are not connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and do not aid in addressing the Mentee's feelings of loneliness and strategies for building new friendships. Additionally, the information lacks natural connection or relevance to the ongoing dialogue.\n\nWhile there is some mention of the Mentor giving guidance and support, which somewhat aligns with the Mentor's role in the dialogue, it is too vague and not specifically relevant to the current context, so it is not highly helpful."
