Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel so grateful to have a boss who is always so supportive of me.\nCo-workers B: That's amazing to hear. Having a supportive boss can make all the difference in how you feel about your job.\nCo-workers A: Definitely. It makes me feel secure in my position and motivated to do my best work.\nCo-workers B: It's great to have that kind of positive reinforcement. Do you remember when we were working on that movie together and you were feeling really frustrated?\nCo-workers A: Oh yeah, I remember. I was so angry after blowing up that rabbit with the dynamite. But talking it out with you really helped me work through my emotions.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. [Co-worker A and Co-worker B met on a movie set where Co-worker A was focused on acting.] - (SameTopic) - [Co-worker A felt remorse for what they did and appreciated Co-worker B's understanding.] - (React) - [Co-worker A is grateful for life experiences and is open to new possibilities in the future.] \n   \n2. [Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B feel that their collaboration brought out the best in each other during the shoot.] - [Co-worker B expressed disapproval of Co-worker A's actions and suggested talking to the director to address the stressful situation.] - [Co-worker B encourages Co-worker A to try relaxation techniques or find a hobby to de-stress and overcome fears.] - [Co-worker A has grown as a person and as an artist, learning about empathy and compassion.]\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad I could help you navigate through that tough situation. It's important to have someone to talk to and support you during challenging times.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a fairly helpful context for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes background information on past interactions between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, such as their collaboration on a movie set and Co-worker A's feelings of remorse and gratitude towards Co-worker B. This aligns well with the current dialogue where they reminisce on a past work event. The details about Co-worker A's growth and Co-worker B's supportive actions could help a language model understand the dynamic between the two characters, allowing it to generate a meaningful response that captures the essence of their supportive relationship. However, some of the memory details, like suggestions for relaxation techniques, might not be directly relevant to the current dialogue. Overall, while the memory doesn't perfectly align with every aspect of the dialogue context, it provides useful insights into their past interactions, contributing to a contextually rich response."
