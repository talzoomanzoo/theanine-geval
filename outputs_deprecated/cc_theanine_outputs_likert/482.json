Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately.\nClassmates B: Why is that?\nClassmates A: I want to be smart and I think algebra can help me think more logically and critically.\nClassmates B: That's a good goal to have. Have you noticed any improvements in your thinking since studying algebra?\nClassmates A: Definitely. I feel like I'm able to break down problems and analyze them more effectively.\nClassmates B: It's always rewarding when hard work pays off.\nClassmates A: Yes it is. It reminds me of when I proved my brother wrong in that race. I was so determined to win and it paid off in the end.\nClassmates B: It's great to see that determination and hard work lead to success in different areas of life.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates A's competitiveness was fueled by facing tough competition from a fast girl in middle school. This motivated them to improve, which Classmates B acknowledged and emphasized the importance of enjoying the journey and effort put in, not just focusing on winning. Both classmates value taking moments to relax and appreciate small things.\n\nClassmates A's drive to challenge themselves and improve their skills is always present. In response, Classmates B offers support and suggests finding a balance. Despite Classmates B offering to take Classmates A to the hospital for a muscle strain in their arm, Classmates A declines, saying they will manage.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, it's amazing how dedication and effort can really make a difference. I just need to keep pushing myself to reach my goals.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains information that could potentially link to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights Classmates A's competitiveness and their drive to improve skills, which aligns with the context of Classmates A's focus on studying algebra to think more logically and critically. Additionally, Classmates B's role in supporting Classmates Aâ€™s ambitions is referenced both in MEMORY and DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY introduces new information about an unrelated muscle strain incident, which is not directly connected to the current dialogue and could potentially distract from the coherence. While some sentences naturally fit the dialogue context by building on Classmates A's determination, the introduction of elements unrelated to algebra, like the hospital offer, slightly detracts from the overall relevance. Therefore, the MEMORY is moderately helpful in providing context for generating the next response."
