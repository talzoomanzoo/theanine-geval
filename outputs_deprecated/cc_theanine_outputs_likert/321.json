Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today?\nCo-workers B: No, you didn't. What did you do there?\nCo-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done.\nCo-workers B: That's good. I hate going to the post office. It's always so crowded.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it was pretty busy today. But I needed to get this package sent out.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of packages, remember that time when you got stranded because you couldn't drive yourself home from a night out with friends?\nCo-workers A: Ugh, don't remind me. That was such a disaster.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B is concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits, but Co-worker B is supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable. In return, Co-worker A is trying to be more responsible but still working on avoiding late nights out and expensive rides. Both co-workers show a supportive and caring attitude towards each other, which helps in their personal growth and mutual understanding.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Well, at least you're making progress in being more responsible. It's all about taking small steps towards improvement.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It implies Co-worker B's concern about Co-worker A's drinking habits and mentions their supportive and caring relationship which links to Co-worker B's comment about Co-worker A getting stranded. This context of concern and support can help Co-worker B's response to be more empathetic or understanding. However, the MEMORY lacks specific details about past events or interactions and does not directly contribute much to the dynamics of the conversation about the post office or packaging. Therefore, while it has some relevance, it is not highly detailed or directly applicable to the immediate context of the conversation."
