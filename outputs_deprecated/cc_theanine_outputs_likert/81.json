Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey, can you keep a secret?\nNeighbors B: Of course, what's up?\nNeighbors A: I can't be seen because I am hiding from my mom behind the door.\nNeighbors B: Oh, why are you hiding from her?\nNeighbors A: She wants me to go to a family dinner tonight, but I'm too tired and just want to relax at home.\nNeighbors B: Maybe you should talk to her about it and let her know how you feel.\nNeighbors A: I know, but I don't want to disappoint her.\nNeighbors B: It's important to take care of your own needs and speak up for yourself. Plus, maybe you can compromise and go to the dinner for a little while and then come back home to relax.\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, thanks for the advice.\nNeighbors B: No problem. Speaking of compromise, remember that dinner we went to a few days ago?\nNeighbors A: Yes, it was so much fun!\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor B is excited to receive the chickpea curry recipe from Neighbors A, who enjoys trying new things like new recipes. Neighbor B offers support and suggests planning a dinner to celebrate Neighbor A's new adventures in learning.\n\nNeighbor B asks about the vegetables and quinoa preparation in Neighbors A's cooking. Neighbor A enjoys trying new things like new recipes and is thinking about exploring new skills or hobbies outside of work, such as taking online courses or learning a new language.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains information about Neighbor A's interest in cooking and exploring new talents, which might reflect their character traits and offer some insight for determining the tone and continuance of the conversation. However, it does not directly relate to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which revolves around Neighbor A hiding from their mom to avoid attending a family dinner. The MEMORY contents focus on cooking and personal development, whereas the dialogue context involves a discussion about family dynamics and personal boundaries. As such, the MEMORY fails to provide substantial useful cues directly relevant to the context or dialogue progression about avoiding the family dinner. The connections are weak, and the information provided does not significantly aid in formulating the next conversational response in context."
