Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message.\nCo-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of skills, you always present a compelling argument in debates. I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive.\nCo-workers A: Yes, I think it's important to back up your claims with facts and figures. It helps to convince the judge or the audience that you're right.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of convincing people, have you ever been in a physical altercation before?\nCo-workers A: Yes, unfortunately. But that doesn't mean I'm a danger to people. I just don't back down from a fight when I'm standing up for what's right.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A believes their evidence is more compelling than the opposing side's evidence. This leads Co-worker B to commend Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs. Co-worker B is happy with the house built by Co-worker A and is considering adding a deck to the house.\n\nCo-worker A plans to present the evidence clearly and persuasively in court, which has led to Co-worker A presenting evidence in front of a judge to support their position in the past. This, in turn, causes Co-worker A to deny that their reputation had any impact on Karen giving them the money.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I respect your commitment to standing up for your beliefs. It takes courage to defend what you believe in.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information but lacks a clear and coherent connection that would aid in generating a proper next response. The memory references instances of Co-worker A's skills in presenting evidence compellingly and persuading others, which is aligned with the dialogue context where Co-worker A discusses the importance of backing up claims with facts. However, the mention of a house and adding a deck is irrelevant to the current conversation about public speaking and debates. Additionally, the sentence regarding Karen and giving money appears disjointed and unrelated to the discussed topics. The MEMORY partially connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it lacks a clear flow and full relevancy, thus earning a middle-level score."
