Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit.\nNeighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A and B are excited to start this weekend and are looking forward to it. They haven't seen each other in a while and are catching up. Neighbor B is being comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A.\n\n2. Neighbors A and B, who are not well acquainted, express their desire to spend more time together. As they catch up after a long time, they discuss the temperature inside the house compared to the hotter weather outside. This leads to Neighbor A's mom scolding them for removing the tag from a new shirt.\n\n3. They make plans to hang out weekly, considering activities like watching a movie, getting coffee, or simply talking. Neighbor B, who enjoys cooking, suggests cooking together. Furthermore, Neighbor B's thoughtful suggestion of having extra water available for when Neighbor A mows the lawn shows mutual consideration.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just enjoy the rest of the day together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about the relationship and interactions between Neighbors A and B, such as their excitement about spending time together, discussing temperatures and plans to hang out, and Neighbor B's thoughtful nature. However, it lacks specific details or structures that directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which primarily focuses on a recent incident where A pushed B into cold water and B's displeasure about it. The MEMORY lacks contextual cues that would aid in constructing the dialogue's immediate response concerning this specific incident. While it does contain some information on their general relationship, it is not directly helpful or relevant to the current conversation, thus not fully meeting the criterion for a higher score."
