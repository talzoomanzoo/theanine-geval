    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, how are you feeling today?\nClassmates B: I'm feeling frustrated. I wish I could do things on my own.\nClassmates A: I understand how you feel. It can be tough when you feel like you're dependent on others.\nClassmates B: Yeah, exactly. I don't want to be a burden on anyone.\nClassmates A: You're not a burden, don't worry. And I'm always here to help you out.\nClassmates B: I appreciate that, but I don't want to always rely on others. I want to be more independent.\nClassmates A: I get it. Maybe there are some small things you can do on your own to start feeling more independent?\nClassmates B: Like what?\nClassmates A: Well, maybe you can start by making a list of things you'd like to do on your own and we can work on achieving those goals together.\nClassmates B: That sounds like a good idea. Thanks for understanding, Classmates A.\nClassmates A: Of course, I'm always here to support you. Hey, speaking of goals, remember when we talked about your guitar playing a few months ago? How's that going?\nClassmates B: It's going really well, thanks for asking! I've been practicing every day and I feel like I'm getting better.\nClassmates A: That's awesome! Have you thought about joining a band or playing gigs around town?\n\nMEMORY:\n- Classmates A and B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as evidenced by their conversation about their respective experiences.\n- Classmates B finds it awesome that Classmates A is pursuing their passion for music after a conversation they had about following dreams. Classmates A bought a sleek and red Mustang GT car, which Classmates B recently bought a red sports car and finds driving it to be fun and freeing.\n- Classmates A plays the guitar, takes lessons, and plays in a band, and has been dreaming of owning a Mustang GT since childhood.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I haven't thought about it yet, but it's something I'd love to explore in the future. Thanks for the suggestion!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the fact that Classmates A plays the guitar and is supportive, which aligns with their encouragement to Classmates B to practice guitar and possibly join a band. However, not all information is directly helpful or connected to the current context. The mention of cars and Classmates A's childhood dream of owning a Mustang GT can be seen as extraneous details that do not contribute to generating a response related to Classmates B's desire for independence or their guitar playing progress. The memory could benefit from more focused and relevant information directly tied to the feelings of frustration and the pursuit of independence discussed in the conversation."
