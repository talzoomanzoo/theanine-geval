Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something.\nClassmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\nClassmates A: Well, it’s been on my mind for a while now and I couldn’t shake it off. I just can't stop thinking about you.\nClassmates B: Oh, really?\nClassmates A: Yes, really. I know we've been friends for a while now, but I feel like there may be something more between us.\nClassmates B: Hmm, I never thought about it that way. But I can’t deny that we have a great connection.\nClassmates A: Exactly! I just feel like we could be more than just friends. If it's something you're open to, of course.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B are supportive friends who look out for each other during stressful times, which contributes to their close relationship built on trust.\n2. Classmates A and B, working on a group project together, share a moment where Classmate A admired Classmate B's courage in sharing a secret, highlighting their supportive nature.\n3. Classmates A values setting high standards and is reluctant to compromise on them, a trait appreciated by Classmates B in their interactions.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate your honesty, and I value our friendship a lot. Let's take some time to think about this before making any decisions.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes that Classmates A and B have a supportive relationship built on trust (Sentence 1), which is relevant since Classmate A is expressing deep feelings and looking for reassurance from Classmate B. Sentence 2 reinforces the supportive nature highlighted in their past interactions, showing that Classmate A admires Classmate B's courage, possibly relating to the bravery needed to disclose one's feelings, as seen in the current dialogue. Sentence 3, while not directly related to romantic feelings, highlights Classmate A’s character, providing additional insight into their personality and interactions. These elements collectively enhance the understanding of the context and potential future interactions, though Sentence 3 is slightly less connected to the immediate context. Overall, the sentences are naturally connected and relevant, warranting a high score."
