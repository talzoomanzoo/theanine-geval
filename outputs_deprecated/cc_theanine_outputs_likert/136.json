Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just visited this amazing new city. The architecture was stunning, the streets were so clean, and the people were very friendly.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A has been living in the same place for a long time and enjoys the neighborhood and people there. This has made them feel comfortable and safe, and they have made good friends, including Neighbor B, whom they value the relationship with and consider like family. As a result, Neighbor A is excited to explore the neighborhood and make new friends.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like an incredible experience! I'm glad you had such a great time exploring the city.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some contextual information about Neighbor A's background and relationship with Neighbor B. It establishes that Neighbor A has been living in the same place for a long time, enjoys the neighborhood, and has strong social connections there, including with Neighbor B. This information could be helpful for a language model to generate responses that are consistent with Neighbor A's appreciation for their local community and relationships, which aligns with the positive experience described in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY lacks direct relevance to the specific context of visiting a new city, as mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While it does convey general information about Neighbor A's character and social preferences, it doesn't explicitly connect these traits to the recent experience shared in the conversation. The MEMORY could be more directly helpful if it included more relevant details about Neighbor A's interest in architecture, traveling, or exploring new places.\n\nOverall, while the MEMORY does provide a basis for understanding Neighbor A's character and social relationships, it could be more directly relevant and structured to better support generating a response that aligns with the specific dialogue context provided."
