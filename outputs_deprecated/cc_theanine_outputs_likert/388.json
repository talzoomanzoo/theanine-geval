    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Wife, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway?\nWife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go?\nHusband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city.\nWife: Oh, that sounds like a perfect idea! It will be nice to have some peace and quiet for a change.\nHusband: Yes, and we could cook our meals together, go for a hike, and just relax. What do you think?\nWife: That sounds lovely, husband. I'm really looking forward to it.\nHusband: Great. I'll start looking for rental cabins right away. I know this may sound impulsive, but I'm really excited to make this happen.\n\nMEMORY:\nThe husband is inspired by his wife to take action on his dreams and goals. This has led to the husband being excited about his progress on long-awaited plans and putting in a lot of effort to make them a reality. As a result, the husband and wife are committed to each other and excited about their future together. Their discussion of setting specific times for updates on progress and waiting for each other for certain events to avoid similar situations is a way to ensure they are on the same page.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information by highlighting that the husband is inspired and motivated by his wife, which ties into his excitement about planning the getaway. However, it lacks specific reference to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the planned weekend getaway, suggesting that it is not fully aligned with the conversation at hand. Additionally, while the sentences in the MEMORY are naturally structured and showcase the couple's commitment to each other, they do not provide enough specific details or context that would help the language model generate a highly personalized response in relation to the getaway plan. Overall, the MEMORY could be more helpful if it included details explicitly connected to the events discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the couple's previous experiences with similar plans or specific preferences for the getaway."
