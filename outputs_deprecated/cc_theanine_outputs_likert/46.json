Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it.\nCo-workers B: That's not the same thing, Co-workers A. Stealing someone and keeping them against their will is illegal and immoral. You need to let go of this obsession and move on.\nCo-workers A: I know you're right, Co-workers B. I just don't know how to get over this feeling.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B showed a willingness to assist others by helping a customer resolve an issue last week, which reflects their supportive nature. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it, similar to the feeling of guilt when Co-worker A spoke with the police about an incident. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and suggested making it up by buying coffee next time, showing their supportive and understanding nature. Co-worker B commended Co-worker A for their bravery and willingness to help, which inspired Co-worker A to stay positive and focus on their recovery as a daunting task. Co-worker B's admiration for Co-worker A's resilience and positivity is appreciated, highlighting the bond of friendship between them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's understandable that you're struggling, Co-worker A. Have you considered talking to someone or seeking professional help to work through these emotions?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly in relation to Co-worker A borrowing a pencil from Co-worker B, and feeling guilty about it. This event is directly referenced in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Co-worker A equates their feelings of guilt regarding their emotions toward the bride to the guilt felt when borrowing the pencil. Additionally, MEMORY highlights Co-worker B's supportive and understanding nature, which aligns with Co-worker B's approach in DIALOGUE CONTEXT when advising Co-worker A to respect the bride's choices. The MEMORY effectively establishes the past interactions between the co-workers, allowing the language model to better understand and simulate the dynamics between them. However, not all parts of the MEMORY are directly useful for generating the next response in this specific context, which prevents a perfect score."
