Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Mentor, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends.\nMentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\nMentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here.\nMentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people.\nMentee: Those are good suggestions, Mentor. I'll consider joining a club or volunteering.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace. Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process.\n2. Mentee is feeling overwhelmed with the college application process. Mentee took shoes from the store without paying because they couldn't afford them.\n3. The Mentee hopes to inspire others to join the cause of gender equality and fighting discrimination. The Mentee has been offered a job and has decided to take the job in the city.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY does not effectively assist the generation of a next response based on the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While it provides some insights into the mentee's past concerns and actions, such as feeling overwhelmed with college applications and being offered a job, these details do not directly relate to the current issue of feeling lonely in a new city. Furthermore, the mention of taking shoes without paying is irrelevant and potentially distracting from the current conversation about forming new friendships. The MEMORY lacks coherence with the dialogue context, and the connections between the mentor's advice on forming connections and the past interactions are not clearly demonstrated. Therefore, the MEMORY does not provide notably helpful information to generate a relevant response in this context."
