Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination.\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off.\nNeighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks?\nNeighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A finds joy in constructing houses efficiently, which led them to assist Neighbor B in constructing a new house with impressive features. Neighbor B then recalls Neighbor A's capability to do positive deeds, mentioning a house built by Neighbor A for them. This prompts Neighbor A to believe in the importance of sunlight, water, and love for plants to flourish.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information about Neighbor A's ability to construct houses and Neighbor B's recall of this skill. However, it does not provide a direct connection or helpful information for generating a response to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on procrastination and finding ways to concentrate on finishing a project. The MEMORY lacks a natural structure or development of past interactions that could aid in constructing a suitable next response in this context. While it paints a picture of Neighbor A's interests and capabilities, it does not provide relevant contextual cues to address the issue of procrastination discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
