Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit.\nNeighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water.\nNeighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it.\nNeighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again.\nNeighbors A: I won't. So, do you remember the time when I mowed the lawn with that old push mower?\nNeighbors B: Yeah, I remember that. That was pretty tough work.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A and B mentioned mowing the lawn with an old push mower, indicating they are responsible for the yard work, causing Neighbor A to feel pressured to look perfect all the time by their mom.\nNeighbors A and B are on friendly terms and enjoy spending time together, as Neighbors B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\nBoth Neighbors A and B enjoy spending time outside, even if it involves doing chores like mowing the lawn, and Neighbor A enjoys spending time in Neighbor B's cozy home and wants to hang out more often.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the mention of mowing the lawn with an old push mower, which aligns with the last part of the dialogue context. This shows a connection between past interactions and helps in understanding the current conversation about memories and shared activities. However, the rest of the MEMORY does not directly pertain to the incident of being pushed into cold water or the emotional tension arising from it. Additionally, while the MEMORY indicates a friendly relationship and shared outdoor activities, it does not provide detailed causality or development for the entire exchange. Thus, it could be more helpful if it included specifics about how Neighbors A and B resolved past conflicts or how they typically interact during disagreements."
