Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just can't believe he left me like that. I thought we were happy together.\nNeighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left?\nNeighbors A: No, I haven't. I don't even know what I would say to him. I feel like I'm not enough, like I wasn't good enough for him.\nNeighbors B: That's not true, Neighbor A. You are an amazing person and you deserve someone who appreciates you for who you are.\nNeighbors A: I just feel so lost right now. I don't know how to move on from this.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A wanted to improve their quality of life by moving out of a run-down apartment complex. This desire led to Neighbors A and B becoming close neighbors who often spend time together outside of their neighborhood. As a result, they enjoy going for walks together, particularly to the park. In addition, Neighbor A is currently grieving the loss of their grandmother, seeking emotional support and understanding from Neighbor B during this challenging time.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I understand, Neighbor A. It's okay to feel lost after a breakup. Just take it one day at a time, and remember that you're not alone in this.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful context for generating a proper response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It clarifies the relationship between Neighbors A and B, indicating that they have grown close due to being neighbors and that Neighbor B is a source of emotional support for Neighbor A during challenging times. This is particularly relevant given the current context of Neighbor A feeling lost and needing encouragement. The information that Neighbor A is also grieving the loss of their grandmother adds an additional layer of understanding to their current emotional state, allowing Neighbor B to respond more empathetically. The memory does, however, include some details (like the moving and enjoyment of walks) that are less directly relevant to the current dialogue context about relationship troubles. Nonetheless, the memory is overall well-structured and provides context that can guide Neighbor B in crafting a supportive response."
