Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, have you noticed how strong I've become?\nNeighbors B: Wow, you do look very strong! Have you been working out?\nNeighbors A: Yes, I go to the gym every day and lift weights. It's been really helping me build muscle.\nNeighbors B: That's great to hear! It reminds me of the time when you apologized to me for the way you treated me.\nNeighbors A: Yes, I realized that I needed to take responsibility for my actions and I didn't want to make the same mistake again.\nNeighbors B: It's always important to own up to our mistakes. It's like when you forgot your backpack in high school and had to deal with the consequences.\nNeighbors A: Definitely. It taught me to always be prepared and double-check everything. It's like how I make sure to tighten screws and wires when working on my computer.\nNeighbors B: It's all about being responsible and taking care of ourselves, just like how you take care of your physical health by working out.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A and B discussed the importance of taking care of trees and the environment for future generations. This reminded Neighbor B of when Neighbor A apologized and acknowledged the hurtful way they were treated. In response, Neighbor A admitted their mistake and apologized. \nNeighbor A apologized to Neighbor B and expressed a desire to make amends, which led Neighbor B to remind Neighbor A about taking responsibility for past mistakes. This made Neighbor A reflect on their behavior and admit to being wrong. \nAfter appreciating the resourcefulness of using fallen trees for firewood, Neighbor A apologized to Neighbor B and expressed a desire to make amends. This prompted Neighbor B to suggest talking to the teacher for a chance to take the test on another day.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely, taking care of my physical health is a top priority for me. It's essential for overall well-being and helps me stay strong and focused.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly the aspect of apologizing and taking responsibility for past mistakes. This corresponds to the exchange in the dialogue where Neighbors A and B discuss Neighbors A's apology and reflection on past actions. However, the MEMORY also contains details that are not directly related to the ongoing dialogue, such as the discussions about trees and the environment, and the potential retaking of a test with a teacher. While these elements might be part of the broader context between Neighbors A and B, they don't directly influence or support the current conversation related to physical strength, responsibility, and personal growth through working out. Therefore, the MEMORY has some helpful elements but also contains additional information that may not directly aid in generating the next response based on the given context. This mixture places the helpfulness at a moderate level, hence the score of 3."
