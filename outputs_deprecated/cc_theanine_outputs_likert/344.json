Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I just gave my boss the written report. I hope she finds it helpful.\nCo-workers B: Did you make sure to include all the necessary details?\nCo-workers A: Yes, I made sure to cover everything we talked about in the meeting. I even added some extra information that I thought could be useful.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A modernized processes and invested in new technology for the family business after taking over, which has been doing well recently.\nCo-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen that they still use and appreciate the gesture.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains two sentences about past interactions between the co-workers: one about Co-worker A modernizing processes for a family business, and the other about Co-worker A giving Co-worker B a pen. The first memory does not relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is focused on a report and work-related matters. The second memory about the pen is somewhat more relevant because it pertains to an interpersonal relationship between the co-workers, but it still does not contribute directly to generating a proper response in the given dialogue context where the focus is entirely on the report and its contents. Although the sentences in the memory showcase past interactions, their relevance and causal connection to the current dialogue context is minimal, resulting in a low helpfulness score."
