Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message.\nCo-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of skills, you always present a compelling argument in debates. I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive.\nCo-workers A: Yes, I think it's important to back up your claims with facts and figures. It helps to convince the judge or the audience that you're right.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of convincing people, have you ever been in a physical altercation before?\nCo-workers A: Yes, unfortunately. But that doesn't mean I'm a danger to people. I just don't back down from a fight when I'm standing up for what's right.\nCo-workers B: That's understandable. Speaking of standing up for what's right, do you remember when you asked Karen for money and she was hesitant at first?\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I remember. But she eventually gave me the cash, and I was able to take care of what I needed to.\nCo-workers B: That's good. And speaking of taking care of things, your carpentry skills are amazing. I loved the house you built for me last year.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B is supportive and interested in the evidence collected by Co-worker A. As a result, Co-worker A is a skilled builder who recently completed building a house for Co-worker B.\nCo-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument. This leads to Co-worker B commending Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs. Additionally, Co-worker A is willing to take on the project of building a deck for Co-worker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly about Co-worker A's public speaking and carpentry skills. The MEMORY does mention Co-worker A's skills in building a house for Co-worker B, which aligns with the last part of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, it lacks mention of specific details such as the public speaking or debating context that is part of the conversation. The memory captures some elements of the development between the two co-workers, like Co-worker B's supportiveness and Co-worker A's courage, but it doesn't offer a comprehensive overview that strongly aids in understanding the entire context of the dialogue. Additionally, the sentence about Co-worker A building a deck for Co-worker B is not mentioned in the conversation, which introduces a minor disconnect. Overall, the relevance is moderate, but more detailed connection and causality are needed for a higher score."
