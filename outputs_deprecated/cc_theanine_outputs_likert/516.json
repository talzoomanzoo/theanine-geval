Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I know you know something about my past. Can you tell me what it is?\nClassmates B: I'm sorry,, but I can't disclose that information. It's not my place to tell.\nClassmates A: But how did you find out? I haven't told anyone.\nClassmates B: Let's just say I have my ways of finding out things. But don't worry,, it's nothing bad or embarrassing.\nClassmates A: Okay, but it's still bothering me that you know something about me that even my closest friends don't know.\nClassmates B: I understand how you feel, but sometimes it's best to keep certain things to ourselves. Trust me, it's for your own good.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A felt nervous about fitting in but admired Classmates B's popularity and desired their friendship. In response, Classmates B cautioned Classmates A to be vigilant and mindful while on the bus, as well as warned about the risks of dark alleys.\n   \n2. During their conversation, Classmates A and B discussed how a positive mindset can create a positive impact on the world. This led Classmates B to appreciate Classmates A's sincere friendship and optimistic outlook. Consequently, Classmates B motivated Classmates A to continue pursuing their aspirations.\n\n3. After their interaction, Classmates B expressed willingness to adopt a more optimistic approach. This stemmed from Classmates A's initial nervousness about fitting in, admiration for Classmates B, and eagerness to befriend them. Additionally, Classmates B reiterated the importance of being cautious on the bus and avoiding dark alleys.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate your concern. I guess some things are meant to stay private.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context for the relationship between Classmates A and B, highlighting their past interactions and conversations. Sentence 1 and 3 mention Classmates A's nervousness and admiration for Classmates B, as well as B's advice to be cautious. This information could help a language model understand the dynamic between them, as Classmates A feels a level of anxiety and admiration, while Classmates B takes on a cautious, somewhat protective role.\n\nHowever, MEMORY does not directly address the issue of Classmates B knowing something about Classmates A's past, which is the central concern in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Moreover, the flow and connection between sentences are somewhat disjointed, limiting the usefulness of MEMORY for generating a continuation of the current conversation. Although there is relevant information about their rapport, it doesn't fully connect with the specific matter at hand in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Therefore, MEMORY provides moderate helpfulness in this case."
