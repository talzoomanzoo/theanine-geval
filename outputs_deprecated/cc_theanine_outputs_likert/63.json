Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I need to talk to you about something important.\nClassmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\nClassmates A: I know about your affair with that other woman.\nClassmates B: What are you talking about? I don't have an affair with anyone.\nClassmates A: Don't lie to me! I saw you together at the restaurant last week.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Classmates B is considering taking biology classes in college to learn more about how the body works, while Classmate A is considering majoring in biology or the medical field.\n- Both Classmates A and B enjoy talking to each other, considering themselves great study partners, while Classmate A is balancing high school and college classes to be successful and help their family.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nThe MEMORY provided does not contain any relevant or helpful information for generating a proper response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The dialogue involves a serious accusation regarding an affair, whereas the MEMORY discusses unrelated topics like career interests and study partnerships. These memory sentences do not help in understanding the current situation or in forming a response to the emotional context of the conversation. Additionally, there is no connection or relevance between the MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making it difficult for a language model to use the MEMORY in formulating an appropriate response."
