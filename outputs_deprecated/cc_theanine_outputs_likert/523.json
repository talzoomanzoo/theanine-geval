Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just can't believe he left me like that. I thought we were happy together.\nNeighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left?\nNeighbors A: No, I haven't. I don't even know what I would say to him. I feel like I'm not enough, like I wasn't good enough for him.\nNeighbors B: That's not true, Neighbor A. You are an amazing person and you deserve someone who appreciates you for who you are.\nNeighbors A: I just feel so lost right now. I don't know how to move on from this.\nNeighbors B: It's going to take time, but you will get through this. Do you want to talk about how you're feeling or do something to take your mind off of things?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A wanted to improve their quality of life by moving out of a run-down apartment complex. Neighbor B, who frequents the park for walks, now accompanies Neighbors A on their walks, especially to the park. Neighbor B also provides emotional support and understanding to Neighbor A during their time of grief.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information that can support the language model in generating an appropriate next response. It highlights that Neighbor B has been providing emotional support and understanding to Neighbor A, which aligns with the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Neighbor B is consoling Neighbor A. Additionally, the mention of them going for walks, especially at the park, could be pertinent if the conversation were to shift towards discussing activities to help Neighbor A cope with their emotions, as suggested by Neighbor B in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the mention of moving out of the run-down apartment complex does not directly relate to the immediate conversation about the breakup, which slightly detracts from its relevance. Overall, MEMORY is somewhat helpful, but not fully integrated or directly aligned with the current crisis discussion."
