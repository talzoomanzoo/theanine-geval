Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I marked the boundary line with a pen on the wall so that we can both be clear about where my property ends and your property begins.\nNeighbors B: Oh, okay. I didn't realize there was any confusion about that.\nNeighbors A: Well, I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page. I don't want any misunderstandings in the future.\nNeighbors B: I understand. Is there anything else we should do to make sure we're clear about this?\nNeighbors A: I don't think so, but if you have any other suggestions, I'm open to hearing them.\nNeighbors B: No, I think the line is a good idea. It's clear and simple.\nNeighbors A: Great. Hey, speaking of lines and boundaries, remember when we talked about my promotion at work? I had to set some clear boundaries with my team about what I expected from them.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A believes in setting goals, developing a positive attitude, and taking action for personal development and career advancement. This belief causes Neighbor A to offer to help Neighbor B with getting into a workout routine. In reaction, Neighbor B offers to be more supportive and check in on Neighbor A more often.\nNeighbor A's favorite book, \"The Great Gatsby,\" causes Neighbor B to admire Neighbor A's career advancement and express interest in borrowing the personal development book. As a result, Neighbor A wants to help Neighbor B with getting into a workout routine. Both neighbors emphasize the importance of taking care of each other as neighbors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's important. Setting boundaries can help create a more productive work environment. How did your team react to the new expectations you set?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information about Neighbor A's beliefs and attitudes towards personal development and career advancement, which can be somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Neighbor A talks about setting boundaries related to their promotion at work. However, the MEMORY predominantly focuses on topics such as workout routines and book preferences, which are not directly connected to the current conversation about property boundaries and misunderstandings. Additionally, the MEMORY doesn't provide a coherent narrative or clear development of past interactions between the two neighbors that could help with generating a relevant and appropriate response based on the current dialogue. The sentences are also not naturally phrased to clearly indicate how they relate to the dialogue context, making it challenging for a language model to utilize them effectively in this context."
