Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey, can you keep a secret?\nNeighbors B: Of course, what's up?\nNeighbors A: I can't be seen because I am hiding from my mom behind the door.\nNeighbors B: Oh, why are you hiding from her?\nNeighbors A: She wants me to go to a family dinner tonight, but I'm too tired and just want to relax at home.\nNeighbors B: Maybe you should talk to her about it and let her know how you feel.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A enjoys cooking and made roasted vegetables and quinoa for dinner. Neighbors A and B joke about the fun aspects of using telekinesis to surprise people. Neighbors B is excited and supportive of Neighbors A's new ability. Neighbor B offers support and suggests planning a dinner to celebrate Neighbor A's new adventures in learning.\n\nNeighbors B is interested in Neighbors A's cooking and asks about the vegetables and quinoa preparation. Neighbors A and B joke about the fun aspects of using telekinesis to surprise people. Neighbors A is overwhelmed but also excited about their new ability. Despite that, Neighbor A feels there is no room for growth or new projects at their current job.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information that is not directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Neighbors A hiding from their mom to avoid a family dinner. The MEMORY focuses on Neighbors A's cooking and a new ability related to telekinesis, as well as some general workplace dissatisfaction, which doesn't relate to the immediate issue of hiding from their mom. The MEMORY does provide some context about the relationship between Neighbors A and B, such as their supportive and joking nature, which could potentially be helpful in understanding their dynamic. However, it lacks specific information that would naturally lead to generating a response related to the current topic of the family dinner and Neighbors A's need to relax, thereby limiting its helpfulness."
