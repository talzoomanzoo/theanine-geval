Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager!\nCo-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge.\nCo-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail.\nCo-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of new products, remember when you used to fantasize about being a great leader?\nCo-workers A: Ha, yeah. That seems like ages ago.\nCo-workers B: Well, now you can finally take on that leadership role and make your dreams a reality.\nCo-workers A: That's true. It's amazing how life works out sometimes. But it hasn't always been smooth sailing. Remember when I was really stressed about you not liking me?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, I remember. But we worked through it, didn't we?\nCo-workers A: We definitely did. And it taught me to just take things one step at a time, like I am with this new role.\nCo-workers B: Exactly, and I'm sure you'll apply that same mentality to your training as well. I remember you were really dedicated to it a couple of years ago.\nCo-workers A: Oh yeah, I still try to keep up with it whenever I can. It's important to stay physically and mentally fit, especially with this new job.\nCo-workers B: Just don't let your anger get the better of you again. Remember when you exploded and started throwing things?\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B encourages Co-worker A to pursue a leadership position and emphasizes the qualities of a good leader. This aligns with Co-worker A's aspirations of being a great leader and stressing the importance of communication. Additionally, Co-worker A used to dream about being a respected leader, showing a consistent focus on leadership qualities.\n\nCo-worker B advises Co-worker A to manage their emotions and communicate effectively, especially in their relationship with Co-worker B. This guidance stems from Co-worker A feeling stressed about their past interactions with Co-worker B and highlights the importance of open discussions to resolve issues.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information in terms of highlighting the past interactions and dynamics between Co-worker A and B, particularly focusing on leadership and communication, which are themes relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, it lacks specific examples of development or context that could aid in generating a natural response. The MEMORY could be more detailed and provide better connections to the current conversation topics, like Co-worker A's promotion and their development over time. While the information is somewhat relevant, it does not fully capture the nuances of Co-worker A's evolution in a way that would strongly aid in generating a natural continuation of the dialogue. The MEMORY seems a bit repetitive and could use more specificity related to the recent promotion and Co-worker A's growth trajectory. It's useful to some extent but could be structured to offer clearer development and causality for the interaction context."
