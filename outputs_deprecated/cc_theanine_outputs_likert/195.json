Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager!\nCo-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge.\nCo-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A has grown and become more confident over the years, which is a start towards being a leader. \nCo-worker A has fantasies of being a great leader and is focused on getting along and working smoothly with Co-worker B. \nCo-worker B acknowledges and supports Co-worker A's growth and progress, advising them to take small steps and have one conversation at a time. \nCo-worker B encourages Co-worker A to consider pursuing a leadership position, highlighting the qualities of a good leader. \nCo-worker A felt stressed about their relationship with Co-worker B in the past, which caused them to feel embarrassed for losing control of their emotions.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks, I really appreciate your support and encouragement. I'm looking forward to taking on this new role and making a positive impact.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides relevant background information that complements the DIALOGUE CONTEXT by detailing the relationship dynamics and history between Co-workers A and B. It illustrates Co-worker A's growth towards leadership, supported by Co-worker B, which aligns with A's recent promotion and B’s supportive response in the context. The mention of Co-worker A having stress about their relationship and focusing on positive interaction with Co-worker B provides additional depth to A’s anxiety about the new role, as well as emphasizing the supportive relationship between the two. Overall, MEMORY provides useful context for understanding the current dialogue, is well-structured, and is naturally connected, enhancing the ability of the language model to generate a suitable next response."
