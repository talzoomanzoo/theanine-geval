    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I have some exciting plans for the future that I wanted to share with you.\nClassmates B: Oh really? What are they?\nClassmates A: Well, I was thinking that we could work on a project together and maybe even become business partners.\nClassmates B: Wow, that sounds amazing! What kind of project are you thinking about?\nClassmates A: I was thinking about starting a marketing agency specialized in social media.\nClassmates B: That's a great idea! I'd love to work with you on that. We could really make a difference in the industry.\nClassmates A: Yes, exactly! And I think our skills complement each other's so well.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmate A and Classmate B enjoy socializing and going out to parties together. \nClassmates A and B are open to meeting for coffee again in the future.\nClassmates A agreed to try the suggestion and thanked Classmates B for it.\nClassmates B encourages Classmates A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I agree, our skills would definitely work well together in a marketing agency. We should definitely start planning and working on this project soon.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT in which Classmates A and B are discussing a future business project together. The MEMORY contains general and somewhat irrelevant information about their social life and previous encouragements, but it lacks specific details or context about their past interactions related to business or collaboration. As such, the MEMORY offers limited helpful information for a language model to generate a proper next response in the context of planning a marketing agency project. Thus, it scores low based on the given criterion."
