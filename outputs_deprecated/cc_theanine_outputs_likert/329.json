Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, how's it going?\nNeighbors B: Not bad, thanks. How about you?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor B is interested in chiropractic care after hearing about Neighbor A's positive experience. Neighbor A looks forward to playing with Neighbor B again when feeling better. Neighbor A found some of their dog's toys while packing, indicating they have a golden retriever. Neighbor A offered to provide the name of their chiropractor to Neighbor B if they decide to go.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains several sentences that are relevant and helpful for generating a language model's response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It indicates that Neighbor B has shown interest in chiropractic care, a topic that could emerge in subsequent conversations. The MEMORY also mentions Neighbor A's willingness to share their chiropractor's contact information, which is a directly actionable point that could be naturally integrated into a dialogue if the conversation shifts in that direction. Furthermore, the MEMORY alludes to a social aspect, with Neighbor A expressing a desire to play with Neighbor B again when feeling better, which hints at a friendly relationship and provides context for possible topics like shared activities or health. The mention of Neighbor A packing and finding dog toys is less directly connected but does contribute some context about Neighbor A's life (owning a golden retriever), which could influence light-hearted or neighborly exchanges. Overall, while not every detail is immediately relevant, the MEMORY is well-structured and useful for inferring conversation directions given the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
