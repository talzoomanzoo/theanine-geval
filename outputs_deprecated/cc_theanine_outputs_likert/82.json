Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey, can you keep a secret?\nNeighbors B: Of course, what's up?\nNeighbors A: I can't be seen because I am hiding from my mom behind the door.\nNeighbors B: Oh, why are you hiding from her?\nNeighbors A: She wants me to go to a family dinner tonight, but I'm too tired and just want to relax at home.\nNeighbors B: Maybe you should talk to her about it and let her know how you feel.\nNeighbors A: I know, but I don't want to disappoint her.\nNeighbors B: It's important to take care of your own needs and speak up for yourself. Plus, maybe you can compromise and go to the dinner for a little while and then come back home to relax.\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, thanks for the advice.\nNeighbors B: No problem. Speaking of compromise, remember that dinner we went to a few days ago?\nNeighbors A: Yes, it was so much fun!\nNeighbors B: I'm glad you enjoyed it. Maybe we can make it a regular thing and try out new restaurants together.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A enjoys cooking and made roasted vegetables and quinoa for dinner. They also like trying new things, such as exploring new recipes. Neighbor A is considering looking for a new job but is uncertain about the direction they want to take. \nNeighbors A and B share a dream of developing telekinetic abilities together in the future. Neighbor B is excited and supportive of Neighbor A's new ability. They are discussing the idea of having telekinetic abilities and how it could open up new opportunities in Neighbor A's current job or future career.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great idea! I'm always up for trying new places to eat.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some details about Neighbors A and B which could provide context for their interaction. For instance, it mentions that Neighbor A enjoys cooking and exploring new recipes, which somewhat relates to enjoying dinners and trying new restaurants as mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, much of the MEMORY, like the discussion about telekinetic abilities and a new job, is unrelated to the specific context of A hiding from their mom and talking about family dinner plans. The MEMORY pieces are not naturally connected in a way that builds directly on the current conversation topic. Nonetheless, the phrasing and structure of the MEMORY are generally clear and could be easily identified as background detail, which prevents it from being entirely irrelevant."
