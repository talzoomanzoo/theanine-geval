Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey, can you keep a secret?\nNeighbors B: Of course, what's up?\nNeighbors A: I can't be seen because I am hiding from my mom behind the door.\nNeighbors B: Oh, why are you hiding from her?\nNeighbors A: She wants me to go to a family dinner tonight, but I'm too tired and just want to relax at home.\nNeighbors B: Maybe you should talk to her about it and let her know how you feel.\nNeighbors A: I know, but I don't want to disappoint her.\nNeighbors B: It's important to take care of your own needs and speak up for yourself. Plus, maybe you can compromise and go to the dinner for a little while and then come back home to relax.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors B is interested in Neighbors A's cooking and asks about the vegetables and quinoa preparation. They then joke about the fun aspects of using telekinesis to surprise people. Neighbors B is excited and supportive of Neighbors A's new ability. Neighbor A feels there is no room for growth or new projects at their current job.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll try to find a compromise with her. Thanks for the advice.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some potentially helpful context related to Neighbors B being supportive of Neighbors A, which is consistent with the supportive advice given in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the majority of the MEMORY is unrelated to the current dialogue situation, which involves Neighbors A hiding from their mom to avoid a family dinner. The references to cooking, telekinesis, and job dissatisfaction do not directly contribute to generating the next response based on the situation where Neighbors A is hiding. Furthermore, the MEMORY lacks a clear connection or development related to the reasons behind Neighbors A's actions in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Therefore, while there is a minor link in the supportive nature, the MEMORY, on the whole, is not very helpful in providing useful information for this specific context."
