Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life.\nChild: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations, which caused them to now live in a little house in the suburbs that they love.\n2. The child's supportive and caring nature towards the parent makes the parent want to provide a safe and stable environment, as they value independence and self-sufficiency.\n3. Both the parent and child express love and support for each other, with the child finding the parent's story inspiring as the parent mentions making mistakes in the past and trying to turn their life around.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information that could potentially help in generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Here are the reasons for the given score:\n\n1. Sentence 2 of the MEMORY expresses the child's supportive and caring nature, and the parent's response to provide a safe environment. This is relevant as it echoes the mutual appreciation and understanding between the parent and child, which is mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n   \n2. Sentence 3 indicates a supportive relationship between the parent and child, with the parent mentioning past mistakes, which complements the context where listening is valued. It alludes to a backstory of learning and growth, enhancing the current dialogue about the significance of listening.\n\n3. However, Sentence 1 seems less directly connected to the current dialogue. While it provides a background about the parent's new living situation, it doesn't directly tie into the theme of being a good listener or the mutual understanding discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides some helpful cues for understanding the relationship and context in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but lacks the cohesive connection across all points that would warrant a higher score."
