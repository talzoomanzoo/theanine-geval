Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I really enjoy being a carpenter. It's a very fulfilling job.\nClassmates B: That's great to hear! How did you get into carpentry?\nClassmates A: My dad was a carpenter, so I grew up around it. I started by helping him out when I was young, and then I began to really enjoy it myself.\nClassmates B: That's awesome that you were able to learn from your dad and turn it into a career. Have you done any big projects lately?\nClassmates A: Yeah, I just finished building a custom bookshelf for a client. It was a challenging project, but I'm really happy with how it turned out.\nClassmates B: That's impressive! You must have a lot of skill to be able to build something like that.\nClassmates A: Thanks! It definitely takes a lot of practice and attention to detail. But I find it really rewarding to see a finished product that I created with my own two hands.\nClassmates B: I can imagine. It must also be nice to have a steady income from your work.\nClassmates A: Absolutely. It's a good feeling to be able to support myself and my family doing something that I enjoy. Plus, I never know what exciting project might come my way next.\n\nMEMORY:\n[Classmate A supports the President and appreciates the difficult decisions and actions taken to improve the country's situation.] - (React) - [Classmates A appreciates the support and encouragement from Classmates B and is encouraged to pursue their dream.] \n[Classmate A has a business idea and is attending a seminar on starting a business to make it a reality.] - (Causes) - [Classmates A plans to perform at an open mic night at a cafe next week.] \n[Classmate A appreciates the President's decisions and actions to improve the country's situation and appreciates the support and encouragement from Classmates B.] - (Want) - [Classmates A wants to get to know Classmates B better and become friends, and Classmate B offers support and potential collaboration in the future.]\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does not contain information relevant or helpful for generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY focuses on Classmate A's support for the President, a business idea, and planning to perform at an open mic night. None of these elements connect to or develop the context of carpentry and recent projects that Classmates A and B are discussing. Additionally, the MEMORY lacks any clear causality or progression aiding the understanding of their conversation about carpentry. Consequently, the MEMORY does not meet the criterion of providing relevant and naturally structured sentences to support generating a next response in the given context."
