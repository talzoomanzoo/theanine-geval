Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend!\nCo-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Co-worker A discovered that an employee was hiding clothes to sell on the side, while Co-worker B mentions that their store is getting new inventory next week, specifically a new line of athletic wear.\n- Co-worker A suggests celebrating their detective work with drinks after work, as Co-worker A and Co-worker B both plan to treat themselves to a nice dinner with their paychecks.\n- Co-worker A is described as having \"Sherlock Holmes-like skills\" and enjoys solving mysteries, as Co-worker A and Co-worker B are both looking forward to the new athletic wear and mention getting a discount on their purchases.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nThe MEMORY provided does not contain information that is helpful for generating a relevant response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves a discussion about Co-worker A singing a solo at church, while the MEMORY entries focus on retail-related activities and past interactions regarding inventory and detective work. There is no connection between the MEMORY and the specific context of singing or church involvement, and the details in the MEMORY do not offer any meaningful contextual cues that can contribute to advancing the conversation about Co-worker A's singing or musical activities. The lack of relevance and connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT results in a low score for helpfulness."
