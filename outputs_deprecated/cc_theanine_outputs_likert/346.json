Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I just gave my boss the written report. I hope she finds it helpful.\nCo-workers B: Did you make sure to include all the necessary details?\nCo-workers A: Yes, I made sure to cover everything we talked about in the meeting. I even added some extra information that I thought could be useful.\nCo-workers B: That's smart thinking. It shows that you're invested in the company and want to make sure things run smoothly.\nCo-workers A: Thanks. I learned a lot from taking over the family business. It taught me the importance of being efficient and proactive.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A's father was hesitant to hand over the business but now trusts Co-worker A, which led to Co-worker A taking over their family's business a few years ago, resulting in improvements since then. This experience taught Co-worker A the importance of being efficient and proactive.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information that is directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It explains the background of Co-worker A's experience with taking over the family business, which relates to the conversation about Co-worker A's proactive approach to work. The MEMORY connects the past interactions effectively, showing the development and causality that led Co-worker A to value efficiency and proactiveness, which aligns with the conversation context. The structured memory allows the language model to easily identify and use relevant context, thus making it highly helpful for generating a coherent and contextually appropriate response."
