Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm sorry you had to hear me swear like that. I shouldn't have lost my temper like that.\nNeighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A and Neighbor B share a mutual support system, as Neighbor A helped with Neighbor B's lawn in the past. This support was reciprocated when Neighbor B was understanding and supportive of Neighbor A's mistake. Additionally, Neighbor A mentioned cleaning up a tree house to prevent insects and spiders, which led to a discussion about rearranging the living room, as Neighbor A expressed interest in doing so and Neighbor B has experience with furniture rearrangement.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It was just a combination of work stress and a few personal issues piling up. I appreciate you being understanding.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides moderate helpfulness for generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes a background of camaraderie and support between Neighbors A and B, as Neighbor A had previously helped with Neighbor B's lawn, and Neighbor B was understanding of Neighbor A's mistake. This context of mutual understanding aligns with Neighbor B's response in the dialogue, thus aiding in maintaining the empathetic tone. However, the segment about cleaning a tree house and rearranging the living room is not directly relevant to the immediate context of the conversation, which is focused on understanding Neighbor A's current frustration. While these details could potentially be useful in other contexts or future interactions, they remain loosely connected to the present dialogue. The memory could be improved with more focus on the specific issue at hand or by providing more relevant past instances of Neighbor A's frustration or problem-solving interactions with Neighbor B."
