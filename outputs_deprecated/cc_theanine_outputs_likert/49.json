Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today?\nCo-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B offered help and support to Co-worker A, which made Co-worker B feel supportive and glad that Co-worker A is okay. This positive interaction led to Co-worker A having a good job and doing well, despite their difficult upbringing.\n\n2. Co-worker B supported and encouraged Co-worker A to prioritize their health, leading to Co-worker A borrowing a horse from Co-worker B and having a great time riding it. This act of kindness made Co-worker B glad and feeling like the trade worked out well for both of them. Additionally, Co-worker B was impressed by Co-worker A's well-thought-out plans for their partnership.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains information about past interactions between the co-workers, but it is not directly helpful for the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY does establish a positive relationship and a pattern of support between the co-workers, indicating that Co-worker B is generally supportive of Co-worker A. However, the specific details about borrowing a horse and having a great time are not relevant to the current conversation about workload. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it contained information related to work tasks, workload, or stress management, which would be more directly applicable to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While the MEMORY is structured and shows a positive relationship, it lacks direct relevance to the current discussion, hence the score of 2."
