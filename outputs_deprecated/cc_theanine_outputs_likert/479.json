Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately.\nClassmates B: Why is that?\nClassmates A: I want to be smart and I think algebra can help me think more logically and critically.\nClassmates B: That's a good goal to have. Have you noticed any improvements in your thinking since studying algebra?\nClassmates A: Definitely. I feel like I'm able to break down problems and analyze them more effectively.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates A is always looking to challenge themselves and improve their skills. This attitude leads Classmates A to struggle with feeling competitive and the need to be the best at everything. Despite not having similar experiences in the past, Classmates A is feeling worried about the situation. \nClassmates A is always looking to challenge themselves and improve their skills. This leads Classmates B to offer support and suggest taking a step back to find a balance. In response, Classmates A expresses gratitude for the support and friendship of Classmates B, wanting to maintain a strong bond with them. \nClassmates B acknowledges Classmates A's determination and competitiveness, leading Classmates A to acknowledge the need to find a balance and accept the advice given. This mutual understanding strengthens their bond, with Classmates A expressing gratitude for the support and friendship of Classmates B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! It sounds like all your hard work is paying off. Keep it up!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights Classmates A's desire to improve and challenge themselves, which aligns with their focus on studying algebra to enhance logical and critical thinking. The memory also emphasizes Classmates A's competitiveness and their appreciation for Classmates B's support, which could guide Classmates B's response to further encourage or provide advice. Additionally, the acknowledgment of Classmates B's role in offering support and their strengthened bond gives useful context about their relationship dynamics. The sentences are connected and demonstrate development in their interactions. However, some parts of the MEMORY aren't directly relevant to the specific context of studying algebra, such as the struggle with competitiveness, which slightly reduces its overall helpfulness."
