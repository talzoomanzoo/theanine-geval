Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something.\nClassmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\nClassmates A: Well, it’s been on my mind for a while now and I couldn’t shake it off. I just can't stop thinking about you.\nClassmates B: Oh, really?\nClassmates A: Yes, really. I know we've been friends for a while now, but I feel like there may be something more between us.\nClassmates B: Hmm, I never thought about it that way. But I can’t deny that we have a great connection.\nClassmates A: Exactly! I just feel like we could be more than just friends. If it's something you're open to, of course.\nClassmates B: I get what you’re saying,. And to be honest, I’ve had similar thoughts lately. I’m definitely open to exploring this.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B are students in the same class, and they are close with a level of trust between them. This trust is important to Classmate A, who values setting high standards and is hesitant to lower them.\n\n2. Classmates A had doubts about trusting Classmates B due to rumors about their reliability, but eventually, they discovered a secret that Classmates B has been keeping. Despite this, Classmate A recalls a moment where they admired Classmate B's courage and strength in sharing a secret, showing their supportive and compassionate nature.\n\n3. Classmates B assures Classmates A that they will do their part in the group project, which leads to Classmates A appreciating their support and advice, especially since Classmate A tends to overthink things. This support also makes Classmates B feel relieved to have someone to confide in about the secret.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes the prior relationship between Classmates A and B, indicating a level of trust and close friendship, which aligns with Classmate A's desire to explore a deeper connection. The MEMORY reveals that Classmate A values trust and sets high standards, hesitating to lower them, which may play a role in their consideration of pursuing a romantic relationship. The MEMORY events contribute to understanding Classmate A's thought process and the dynamics of the relationship. \n\nAdditionally, the mention of a previous moment of admiration Classmate A felt and the supportive nature of their interaction offer further insight into why Classmate A might be considering more than friendship. However, some parts, like the group project, are less directly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and do not provide the same level of insight about pursuing a romantic relationship. Thus, while generally helpful, not all MEMORY sentences are as connected to the dialogue development as they could be, preventing a perfect score."
