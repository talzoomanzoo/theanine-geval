    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I know you know something about my past. Can you tell me what it is?\nClassmates B: I'm sorry,, but I can't disclose that information. It's not my place to tell.\nClassmates A: But how did you find out? I haven't told anyone.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Classmates A was nervous about fitting in but saw Classmates B as well-liked and wanted to be friends with them. This made Classmates B open to trying to be more optimistic after the conversation.\n- Classmates B advises Classmates A to be careful and aware while on the bus, which is in the same topic as warning Classmates A about the potential danger of dark alleys.\n- Classmates A emphasizes the importance of resilience and staying positive even when things don't go as planned. This genuine friendship and positive attitude of Classmates A is appreciated by Classmates B, who encourages Classmates A to keep striving towards their goals. Classmates A, in turn, is curious and open to exploring new things and taking risks.\n- Classmates A believes in the power of positivity and its impact on life, which caused Classmates A and B to become friends when Classmates A transferred to the school. This is in the same topic as Classmates A not having trouble on the bus so far.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I overheard a conversation between some classmates. I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but that's how I found out.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information that could potentially aid in generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it provides context about the relationship between Classmates A and B, such as their friendship, shared positive attitudes, and prior conversations about safety and positivity. These elements can help contextualize Classmate B's reluctance to disclose information about Classmate A's past, suggesting a relationship of mutual respect and concern. However, the MEMORY lacks a direct connection to the specific question about Classmate A's past and how Classmate B learned about it. Some parts appear to be tangential, like the advice about staying positive, which might not directly aid in responding to the current dialogue's focus on past events. Thus, the MEMORY offers moderate helpfulness in relation to the dialogue context."
