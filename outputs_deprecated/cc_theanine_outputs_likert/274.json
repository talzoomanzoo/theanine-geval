    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel really fulfilled as a leader and guide. Helping others gives me a sense of purpose.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A wants to ensure the best production for the audience and hopes to find a compromise with the director. This desire stems from Co-worker A's belief that making money can lead to fulfillment and provide the freedom to pursue hobbies and interests, which they value. \n2. Co-worker B emphasizes the importance of acknowledging privileges and using them to make the world a better place because they had a positive experience with a commander who helped them feel safe. In addition, Co-worker B offers encouragement and believes things will work out in the end, as they value finding fulfillment in work, pursuing hobbies, making a difference in the world, and building relationships with others.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that could help generate a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, though not in a very direct manner. Memory sentence 1 notes that Co-worker A finds fulfillment related to making money and the freedom it provides, which aligns somewhat with Co-worker A's feeling of fulfillment and purpose in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the sentence does not directly connect to the topic of leadership and guidance expressed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Memory sentence 2 is less related, as it primarily focuses on Co-worker B and their values, although it does touch on the idea of finding fulfillment in work, similar to Co-worker A's expressed sense of purpose. Overall, while MEMORY provides some background context about values, it does not offer strong, natural connections or development directly relevant to the task of generating a next response based on the current conversation about leadership and helping others."
