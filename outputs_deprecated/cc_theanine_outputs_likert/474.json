    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just got back from my trip to South America. It was amazing!\nNeighbors B: Oh really? Where did you go?\nNeighbors A: I visited Brazil and Peru. The culture and food were incredible.\nNeighbors B: That sounds awesome. I've always wanted to go to Peru to see Machu Picchu.\nNeighbors A: Yes, Machu Picchu is amazing. The view from the top is breathtaking.\nNeighbors B: Have you thought about where you want to go next?\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I'm thinking about visiting Australia and Antarctica next. I want to see the Great Barrier Reef and the penguins.\nNeighbors B: Wow, that's quite a contrast. From the hot desert to the cold ice. It must be interesting to experience such different environments.\nNeighbors A: Definitely, that's what I love about traveling. You get to see and experience so much diversity in the world.\nNeighbors B: It's so true. I'm jealous of all the places you've been to. I haven't even left the country!\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A taught the kid a special move in chess, relieving the kid's stress. Neighbors B agrees to buy candy for the neighborhood kids to bring them joy. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's organization skills and aspires to enhance their own. Neighbors A is receptive to being cautious and making informed choices. \nNeighbors A defeated a kid in chess with a unique move. Both Neighbors A and B value performing acts of kindness to unite the community. Neighbors A emphasizes the benefits of organization in planning, strategic thinking, and winning games like chess. Neighbor A is willing to take precautions and make wise decisions. \nBoth Neighbors A and B prioritize learning and self-improvement. They also believe in fostering community unity through acts of kindness. Neighbors A underscores the advantages of organization in planning, strategic thinking, and winning games like chess. Neighbor A is open to being cautious and making informed decisions.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "You should definitely plan a trip abroad when you get the chance. It's a wonderful experience to explore different cultures and landscapes.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides detailed information about Neighbors A and B's personalities and interests, such as their engagement in community activities, their values, and Neighbors A's chess skills. However, this information does not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is mostly about travel experiences and aspirations. While the MEMORY could provide some insight into the characters' personalities, it lacks clear and direct connections to the conversation topics, such as traveling or specific events related to past trips. Consequently, it does not offer significant helpful contextual information for a language model to generate the next response in the given dialogue. There are naturally structured sentences, but they do not contribute to understanding the dialogue context deeply."
