Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something.\nClassmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\nClassmates A: Well, it’s been on my mind for a while now and I couldn’t shake it off. I just can't stop thinking about you.\nClassmates B: Oh, really?\nClassmates A: Yes, really. I know we've been friends for a while now, but I feel like there may be something more between us.\nClassmates B: Hmm, I never thought about it that way. But I can’t deny that we have a great connection.\nClassmates A: Exactly! I just feel like we could be more than just friends. If it's something you're open to, of course.\nClassmates B: I get what you’re saying,. And to be honest, I’ve had similar thoughts lately. I’m definitely open to exploring this.\nClassmates A: I’m so relieved to hear that. I was worried that I might be crossing a line by expressing my feelings.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B are supportive friends who look out for each other during stressful times.\n2. Classmates A and B are close and have a level of trust between them.\n3. Classmates A tends to overthink things and appreciated Classmates B's support and advice.\n4. Classmate B encourages self-compassion and finding a balance between striving for excellence and being kind to oneself.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY includes the following relevant points:\n\n1. Classmates A and B have a supportive friendship and trust each other, which aligns with the familiarity and connection described in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n2. Classmate A's tendency to overthink, appreciated by Classmate B’s support and advice, underscores the emotional context of their conversation.\n3. Classmate B's encouragement of self-compassion and balance could be relevant to how both classmates continue their discussion.\n\nThese points are meaningful for a language model representing Classmates B because they provide background on their relationship's nature and the emotional dynamics at play. However, not every sentence directly correlates to the romantic shift in the dialogue, slightly limiting relevance, which prevented a perfect score of 5. Nonetheless, the phrases are coherent and naturally articulated, making it easier for the model to distinguish helpful cues from secondary ones."
