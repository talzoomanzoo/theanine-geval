Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend!\nCo-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while.\nCo-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing?\nCo-workers A: I sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites.\nCo-workers B: That's such a beautiful song. You have a great voice.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! It was really nerve-wracking, but I'm glad I did it.\nCo-workers B: I'm sure the audience loved it. You've really got some talent.\nCo-workers A: Thanks again. It's just something I do for fun, but it's nice to know people enjoy it.\nCo-workers B: Definitely. It's great to have a hobby like that. Reminds me of when you uncovered that mystery a while back. You always seem to surprise us with your skills.\nCo-workers A: Haha, yeah. I do like a good challenge. Speaking of surprises, remember when I found out you were married? That was a shocker.\nCo-workers B: Oh gosh, yes. I forget sometimes that not everyone knows. But yeah, I've been married for a few years now.\nCo-workers A: Crazy how time flies. Like when we found out Ms. Singh was leaving our school. I still can't believe that was two years ago.\nCo-workers B: I know, right? She was such a great teacher. Speaking of which, have you heard anything about her lately?\nCo-workers A: Not really. I think she moved to another state, but I'm not sure where.\nCo-workers B: Ah, okay. Well, hopefully she's doing well wherever she is. But hey, getting back to your solo, I think you should definitely do it again sometime.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A and Co-worker B both plan to treat themselves to a nice dinner with their paychecks. This leads to Co-worker A suggesting celebrating their detective work with drinks after work. As a result, Co-worker B, who is married, had a weekend where they went hiking and had dinner with friends. This then triggers happy memories from their time working together, which Co-worker A and Co-worker B shared.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's a good idea. I'll definitely consider singing again in the future. Thanks for the encouragement!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided does not align closely with the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY references treating themselves with dinner and celebrating detective work, which is only vaguely mentioned in passing in the context. The relevant part about Co-worker B being married is mentioned in the dialogue, but it's not substantially developed in the MEMORY. Additionally, there are fragments about hiking and reminiscing about past work, but these are not connected clearly to the current conversational thread about performing at church or Ms. Singh. Though there is some marginal relevance in acknowledging past experiences, overall, the MEMORY does not directly provide helpful information, contextual cues, or structured connections that contribute to the ongoing dialogue about singing or reminiscing about Ms. Singh. To be more helpful, the MEMORY should directly relate to those aspects of the conversation with clearer connections and relevant causality."
