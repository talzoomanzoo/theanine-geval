    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Husband, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway?\nWife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The wife's support and pride in her husband's goals inspire him to take action towards his dreams.\n2. The wife's encouragement for the husband's goals makes her want to be more involved in them.\n3. The husband's long-awaited plans drive him to finally act on them, causing disappointment in the wife for not waiting for her and wanting to be included in the plans.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some information that could be relevant to understanding the husband and wife's dynamic, such as the wife's encouragement and the husband's goals. However, the connection between these statements and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is tenuous. The mention of the wife's inspiration and encouragement isn't directly tied to the specific interaction about planning a weekend getaway. While the MEMORY indicates some past interactions, it doesn't offer specific or concrete information that naturally leads into the current context of planning a trip together. The causality and development of past events aren't clearly demonstrated in relation to the current conversation, thus limiting the MEMORY's helpfulness for generating the next response in the dialogue."
