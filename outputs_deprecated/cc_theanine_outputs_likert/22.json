    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A and B started spending more time together, eventually becoming good friends who have known each other for years. They catch up frequently, reminiscing about past events and planning to hang out once a week. Neighbors A enjoys the support and comfort Neighbor B provides, while Neighbor B suggests cooking together and shows consideration by offering extra water for lawn mowing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful context that suggests Neighbors A and B have a long-standing friendship and often do activities together. This background helps to understand their dynamic and why Neighbors A might playfully push Neighbors B into cold water, viewing it as a joke within the context of their friendship. However, MEMORY lacks explicit details about similar past jokes or pranks, which would make it more directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences are naturally phrased and connected, but they provide general background information rather than specific past interactions that could directly inform the generation of a next response in the given context. The MEMORY is moderately helpful but could benefit from more direct relevancy to the current interaction."
