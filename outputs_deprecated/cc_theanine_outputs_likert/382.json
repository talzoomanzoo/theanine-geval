Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Husband, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The wife's support and pride in her husband's goals inspire him to take action towards his dreams.\n2. The husband's drive to achieve his dreams leads to impatience and excitement, causing him to leave without the wife. The wife then brings up past disappointments when he left without her, breaking a promise to wait for her.\n3. The wife's support and encouragement prompt the husband to apologize and promise to involve her in his future plans. He acknowledges his mistake, apologizes, and emphasizes the importance of keeping promises.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains information that is relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context revolves around the husband's desire to spend more time with his wife, suggesting togetherness and planning activities involving both of them. The MEMORY provides background on the couple's past interactions, showing that there were instances when the husband left without his wife, which led to disappointment due to his broken promises. This past behavior creates a clear backdrop for why spending time together, as suggested by the husband, is significant and emphasizes the importance of commitment. \n\nEach sentence in the MEMORY is naturally structured and captures the development and impact of past interactions between the husband and wife. Sentence 2 is especially relevant as it highlights the husband's previous failures to include his wife, which is directly connected to his current proposal for a getawayâ€”a chance to amend past mistakes. Sentences 1 and 3, while less directly related, reinforce the themes of support and reconciliation as they portray the wife as supportive overall, and the husband as acknowledging and learning from past mistakes.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides helpful context that would assist the language model in generating a response that considers the history and dynamics of the relationship. However, the connection between Sentence 1 and the present dialogue is less direct, which somewhat limits the score from a perfect rating."
