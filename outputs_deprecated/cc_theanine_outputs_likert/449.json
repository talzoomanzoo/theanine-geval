Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A invited Classmates B to join the study group together for extra support and studying. This offer was made after they started working on a group project together. Classmates A also offered help and support to Classmates B, recalling a moment where they admired Classmate B's courage and strength in sharing a secret, showing their supportive and compassionate nature.\n\n2. Despite initial doubts about trusting Classmates B due to rumors about their reliability, Classmates A and B are students in the same class. This connection led to Classmates A discovering a secret that Classmates B has been keeping. Classmate A recalls a moment where they admired Classmate B's courage and strength in sharing a secret, showing their supportive and compassionate nature.\n\n3. While working on a group project together, Classmates A was worried about a situation that turned out to be not a big deal. This experience led Classmates A to believe that simple actions can have a significant impact. In a related discussion, Classmate B emphasizes the importance of making mistakes and learning from them for personal growth.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains relevant and helpful information for generating a proper response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights key aspects of the relationship and interactions between Classmates A and B, such as Classmate Aâ€™s supportive nature and their collaborative work on a group project. The MEMORY captures the development of trust and support between the two individuals, which is likely important for understanding the context of Classmate A wanting to discuss something with Classmate B. The connections are naturally structured, allowing a language model to draw upon this relational and interactional background to generate contextually appropriate responses. However, while the information is helpful, it could be more concise or directly related to the immediate context for a perfect score."
