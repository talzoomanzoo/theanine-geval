Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Husband, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today.\nWife: That's lovely! I always feel so cozy and comfortable when you do that.\nHusband: I know, and I love making the apartment feel like a warm and welcoming space for you.\nWife: You always go above and beyond, dear.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The husband feels supported by his wife in pursuing activities that make him happy outside of work and family life, and the wife is glad to see the husband finding a sense of purpose and being happy.\n2. The husband values having someone trustworthy to spend time with and looks forward to working on the podcast project, and both the husband and wife agree that it's the little things that add up and make life meaningful.\n3. The husband feels supported by his wife in pursuing activities that make him happy outside of work and family life, and the wife is glad that the husband has a friend he can trust and enjoy spending time with. They both value the supportive community of believers at church and appreciate having each other by their side.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant and helpful information about the husband's interactions with his wife and their general relationship dynamic. It highlights that the husband feels supported by his wife in his personal interests and both find happiness in the little things of life. This connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where the husband is engaging in an activity that brings comfort and coziness to their shared space. Additionally, the memory provides context on their appreciation for each other's support, which can aid the language model in continuing the conversation in a consistent manner with themes of support and appreciation. However, the memory could be improved by including more direct references to domestic activities or past interactions that directly relate to creating a cozy home environment, as mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Furthermore, there is some repetition in the MEMORY, specifically in sentences 1 and 3, which could be consolidated for clarity. Overall, the MEMORY provides some helpful information but could be more directly linked to the context to merit a higher score."
