Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I can't believe I got caught cheating on my taxes. This is such a mess.\nClassmates B: Wait, what? You cheated on your taxes? That's not okay.\nClassmates A: I know, I know. I was just really struggling financially and I thought I could get away with it.\nClassmates B: You can't just cheat and hope to never get caught. That's not how it works.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B advises Classmates A to stay focused on their goal, believe in themselves, and ask for help if needed. Both classmates have a positive attitude towards each other and their respective goals.\n2. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to keep pushing themselves and not let doubts hold them back. Both classmates have a positive attitude towards each other and their respective goals.\n3. Classmates B advises Classmates A to stay focused on their goal, believe in themselves, and ask for help if needed. Classmates A decided to work at the local grocery store for its proximity to home, flexible hours, and networking opportunities.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm really regretting it now. I should have asked for help with my financial struggles instead of making a bad decision.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided consists of three sentences that primarily focus on positive encouragement and support between Classmates A and B with respect to staying focused on goals and asking for help. However, the DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses on a serious issue of cheating on taxes, indicating a different type of conversation â€”one that involves accountability, ethics, and potential legal consequences.\n\nWhile MEMORY shows that Classmates B offers advice and support to Classmates A, it is not directly relevant or helpful in generating a response to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about tax cheating. Thus, there is a mismatch in subject matter, and MEMORY does not provide enough pertinent information relevant to the specific situation described in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nMoreover, the sentences are somewhat repetitive, mainly focusing on motivation, and do not present a clear development or causality relevant to the current context about the moral implications and consequences of cheating. As a result, MEMORY lacks the depth needed to aid in generating an appropriate response that addresses the issues raised in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Hence, the helpfulness score is rated 2."
