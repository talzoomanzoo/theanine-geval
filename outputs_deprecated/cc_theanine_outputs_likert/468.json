    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just got back from my trip to South America. It was amazing!\nNeighbors B: Oh really? Where did you go?\nNeighbors A: I visited Brazil and Peru. The culture and food were incredible.\nNeighbors B: That sounds awesome. I've always wanted to go to Peru to see Machu Picchu.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A won against a kid in chess using a special move. Neighbors B agrees to buy candy for the neighborhood kids to make them happy. Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's organization skills and wishes to improve their own organization. Neighbor A is open to taking precautions and being smart about their decisions.\n\nNeighbors A and B both took a cooking class together last year, which led them to believe in doing nice things for others to bring the community together. Neighbors A believes that being organized helps in planning ahead, thinking strategically, and winning games like chess. Neighbor A is open to taking precautions and being smart about their decisions.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some information about the past interactions between Neighbors A and B but lacks a direct connection to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context is about a recent trip to South America, but the memory focuses on activities like chess, a cooking class, and organization skills. While the memory demonstrates some development of past interactions, like taking a cooking class together and shared values, it doesn't provide much specific help for generating appropriate responses about the trip discussion in the context. The details about chess, candy for kids, and organization skills are not directly relevant to the travel topic, and the memory lacks a clear connection that could help structure the dialogue about the trip Neighbors A just took."
