Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I just finished my computer course, and I learned so much about using computers effectively.\nClassmates B: That's great! What did you learn specifically?\n\nMEMORY:\n- Classmates B and Classmates A used to dance a lot in middle school, which Classmates B remembers fondly.\n- Classmate B is a supportive friend who listens and offers to help, showing their strong bond with Classmates A.\n- Classmates A and Classmates B are friends who help each other with schoolwork, indicating a supportive friendship.\n- Classmates B emphasizes the consequences of Classmates A's actions and the need for responsibility, leading Classmates A to mature and learn from past mistakes.\n- Classmates A acknowledges the mistake and plans to learn from it, showing personal growth and responsibility.\n- Classmate A appreciates having friends who are there for them during difficult times, with Classmates B being a supportive listener.\n- Classmates B supported Classmates A through a tough time by listening to them, demonstrating their strong friendship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some contextual information about the relationship between Classmates A and B, which might be useful to some degree in understanding their dynamic, but it is not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context is about Classmates A completing a computer course and Classmates B asking what was learned specifically. Most of the MEMORY focuses on their past interactions, showing that Classmate B is supportive and that they have a strong friendship, but these details are not essential for generating a response about the computer course. The MEMORY does not contain any specific information about computers, the course, or related past interactions involving technology that would directly aid in responding to Classmates B's question. Additionally, while the structure of the MEMORY sentences is naturally phrased, they do not significantly aid in developing a response related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
