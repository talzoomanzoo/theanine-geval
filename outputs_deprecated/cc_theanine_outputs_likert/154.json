Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today.\nClassmates B:  That sounds great. What was the talk about?\nClassmates A: It was about the history of the pyramids in Egypt. I learned so much about their construction and the cultural significance they held.\nClassmates B: Wow, that does sound interesting. Did you take any notes?\nClassmates A: Yes, I took lots of notes. I'm excited to study this topic more on my own time.\nClassmates B: That's awesome. It's great to see your enthusiasm for learning.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Classmates B noticed Classmates A's improvement and acknowledged their hard work after working on finishing a history project.\n- Classmates A is dedicated to studying hard and taking extra classes to get into a good college, which Classmates B wants.\n- Classmates A had a moment of frustration in the past but has learned to channel that energy into studies, hindering the finishing of Classmate B's history project.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant and helpful information that provides context to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Classmates A's dedication to studying hard and taking extra classes, which aligns with Classmates A's enthusiasm for learning about the pyramids in Egypt. The memory also highlights past interactions where Classmates B acknowledged Classmates A's hard work, which suggests a supportive relationship, consistent with the positive tone in the dialogue. Although there is a mention of a moment of frustration, it is connected to Classmates A's efforts, further emphasizing their commitment to studies. The sentences are naturally structured, providing an understanding of the development and challenges Classmates A and B have faced, making it easier for a language model to generate a proper next response. However, the memory could be improved with a more direct connection to the specific topic of the pyramids discussed in the dialogue, which is why it scores a 4 instead of a 5."
