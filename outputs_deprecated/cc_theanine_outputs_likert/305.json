Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I marked the boundary line with a pen on the wall so that we can both be clear about where my property ends and your property begins.\nNeighbors B: Oh, okay. I didn't realize there was any confusion about that.\nNeighbors A: Well, I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page. I don't want any misunderstandings in the future.\nNeighbors B: I understand. Is there anything else we should do to make sure we're clear about this?\nNeighbors A: I don't think so, but if you have any other suggestions, I'm open to hearing them.\nNeighbors B: No, I think the line is a good idea. It's clear and simple.\nNeighbors A: Great. Hey, speaking of lines and boundaries, remember when we talked about my promotion at work? I had to set some clear boundaries with my team about what I expected from them.\nNeighbors B: Yeah, I remember. How did that go?\nNeighbors A: It was tough at first, but eventually, everyone respected the boundaries I set and our team was more productive because of it.\nNeighbors B: That's great to hear. It's important to set boundaries and stick to them if you want to be successful in any area of your life.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A enjoys reading and sharing books with Neighbor B. This leads to Neighbor A believing in setting goals, developing a positive attitude, and taking action for personal development and career advancement. As a result, Neighbor A offers to help Neighbors B with getting into a workout routine, and Neighbor B suggests working out together to make it more enjoyable for both of them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Sure! Let's evaluate the provided MEMORY based on the criterion of helpfulness.\n\nThe MEMORIZATION provided includes the following information: \n1. Neighbor A enjoys reading and sharing books with Neighbor B.\n2. This leads to Neighbor A believing in setting goals, developing a positive attitude, and taking action for personal development and career advancement.\n3. As a result, Neighbor A offers to help Neighbor B with getting into a workout routine, and Neighbor B suggests working out together to make it more enjoyable for both of them.\n\nNow let's consider the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The conversation between the neighbors highlights first the communicating of property boundaries, and then transitions into a discussion about setting boundaries, with Neighbor A referencing their work experience where setting boundaries led to more productivity.\n\nConsidering this, let's rate the MEMORY:\n\n- The MEMORY doesn't explicitly mention anything about boundaries, which is the focal point of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, though the topic of boundaries could tangentially relate to setting goals or other elements of personal development.\n- It jumps quite abruptly into personal development and workout routines without establishing a clear connection from the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n- The MEMORY lacks immediacy or tight coherence with the context. The language model might generate responses based more on exercise routines or reading habits, which are not the primary theme of the conversation.\n\nThus, the information in MEMORY does offer some potential thematic relevance, particularly in terms of boundary-setting in personal development, but it lacks clarity in its connection. The MEMORY is not structured in a seamless or naturally connected manner relevant to the ongoing dialogue about boundary setting.\n\nHelpfulness Score: 2"
