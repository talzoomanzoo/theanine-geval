Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm sorry you had to hear me swear like that. I shouldn't have lost my temper like that.\nNeighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset?\nNeighbors A: It was just something that happened at work. My boss was being unreasonable and I couldn't take it anymore.\nNeighbors B: That's understandable. Have you tried talking to your boss about it?\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I have, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I just feel like I'm stuck in a dead-end job.\nNeighbors B: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you considered looking for a new job?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor B shared a childhood memory of their tree house being destroyed due to lack of proper care. This led to Neighbor A helping with their lawn, showcasing mutual support between them. This mutual support is a key characteristic of their relationship as neighbors.\nNeighbor A stressed the significance of maintaining clean outdoor spaces for the future, which Neighbor B agreed with and highlighted the sense of community that arises from assisting each other. This emphasis on mutual help is a core aspect of the bond between Neighbors A and B.\nNeighbor A discussed the importance of cleaning a tree house to prevent insects and spiders from inhabiting it, emphasizing the collaborative nature of their neighborhood where Neighbors A and B assist each other with various tasks. This spirit of reciprocity is valued by Neighbor B, who appreciates the mutual support between them as neighbors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I have thought about it, but I haven't made any decisions yet. It's a tough situation to be in.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about the nature of the relationship between Neighbors A and B, specifically focusing on their history of mutual support and collaboration. This could slightly aid in understanding their dynamic in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Neighbor B shows understanding and concern towards Neighbor A's frustration. However, the specific memories shared (e.g., discussions about tree house maintenance and outdoor cleanliness) do not directly pertain to the work-related issues described in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT or offer specific insight into what Neighbor B might say next regarding Neighbor A's job frustrations. The memories are naturally structured and provide a general sense of their supportive relationship, which could be somewhat helpful, but they lack direct relevance to the current dialogue about Neighbor A's work situation. A higher score would require more specific cues or connections to the current topics discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
