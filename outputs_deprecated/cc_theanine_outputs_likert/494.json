Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I just finished my computer course, and I learned so much about using computers effectively.\nClassmates B: That's great! What did you learn specifically?\nClassmates A: Oh, a lot of things. I learned how to use different programs and software for different tasks, and how to choose the right one depending on what I need to do.\nClassmates B: Do you have any software recommendations for me? I always struggle with choosing the right program.\nClassmates A: It really depends on what you need the software for. But for basic tasks like word processing or spreadsheet management, I would recommend Microsoft Office. It's user-friendly and versatile.\nClassmates B: Thanks, I'll keep that in mind. Did you learn anything else in the course?\nClassmates A: Yeah, I also learned some basic coding languages like HTML and CSS. It was challenging but really interesting.\nClassmates B: Wow, that sounds cool. Do you think you'll pursue coding further?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B emphasizes the consequences of Classmates A's actions and the need for responsibility, which relates to how Classmates A and Classmates B used to dance a lot in middle school.\n2. Classmates A appreciates having friends who are there for them during difficult times, similar to how Classmates A and Classmates B are friends who help each other with schoolwork.\n3. Classmates B emphasizes the consequences of Classmates A's actions and the need for responsibility, leading Classmates A to consider taking a dance class for fun.\n4. Classmates A acknowledges the mistake and plans to learn from it, just like how Classmates B and Classmates A used to dance a lot in middle school, and how Classmate A appreciates having friends who are there for them during difficult times, and how Classmates B supported Classmates A through a tough time by listening to them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nThe MEMORY provided is not really connected or relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context is about learning computer skills and software recommendations, whereas the MEMORY mostly revolves around unrelated themes like dancing, responsibility, mistakes, and friendship during difficult times. These themes do not provide any support or beneficial information for the language model to generate a response about software recommendations or coding, which is the main focus of the dialogue. Furthermore, the MEMORY sentences are repetitive and seem to structure around non-relevant interactions rather than offering developmental cues based on the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
