Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Coach, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nAthlete: Ted Athlete unrolls the map. He looks at it for a few moments before tracing his finger along one of the highways. \"This is our route,\" he says finally, feeling in control.\nCoach: What route are you planning, Ted?\nAthlete: I'm thinking of taking the highway through the mountains, it's a bit longer, but the scenery is beautiful.\nCoach: That sounds like a good plan, as long as we factor in enough time for rest stops and breaks.\nAthlete: Yes, I was thinking we could stop at a few rest areas along the way. It's important to stay hydrated and keep our energy levels up during long drives.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Coach advises the athlete on pre-game meals, emphasizing the need for a balance of carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats, as well as staying hydrated. Both the Athlete and Coach emphasize the importance of small changes in diet impacting performance.\n\n2. The Coach encourages the athlete to continue their good work with nutrition and training. The Athlete seeks approval and praise from the Coach, which has resulted in the Athlete taking on more responsibilities and gaining respect from other players.\n\n3. The Coach reminds the Athlete that little distractions can add up and impact performance. The Coach encourages the Athlete to keep up the good work and acknowledges their achievements, having noticed the Athlete's improvement and dedication to improving skills.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY primarily focuses on the Athlete's nutrition, training, and the importance of minimizing distractions. While these topics are relevant to athletic performance, they do not directly relate to the specific scenario in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is about planning a route for a trip through the mountains and considering rest stops. There is a minor connection in terms of general planning and being prepared (e.g., staying hydrated, balancing activities), but this is not enough to make the MEMORY highly helpful. Additionally, the MEMORY lacks naturally structured sentences that clearly showcase the development or causality of past interactions between the athlete and the coach in relation to route planning, making it difficult for a model to extract relevant contextual cues to generate an appropriate next response in this context."
