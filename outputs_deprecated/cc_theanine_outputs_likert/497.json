Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hi there, I was wondering if you'd like to join me for lunch on Tuesday at the school cafeteria.\nCo-workers B: Oh, sure. Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's support and encouragement after moving on from their past arrest, showing a positive change in their relationship. \n2. Co-worker A's efforts to be more conscious of their actions are acknowledged by Co-worker B, who highlights their responsibility at work and potential for success, boosting Co-worker A's confidence. \n3. Co-worker B reassures Co-worker A that making mistakes is part of the learning process, encouraging them to have more confidence and continue growing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does contain some hints about the relationship between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, like Co-worker B appreciating Co-worker A's support and encouragement. However, these details are too general and do not directly relate to the specific DIALOGUE CONTEXT involving an invitation for a lunch. The memory mentions past incidents of support and encouragement but doesn't clearly show a connection to the current conversation topic to be truly helpful. Additionally, these sentences do not reveal much about the historical interactions between the two that would aid in generating a relevant next conversation line for the given context. Thus, while there's some evidence of their positive relationship, the memories lack causal links or related developments that would make them truly useful in creating a natural and coherent response to the invitation."
