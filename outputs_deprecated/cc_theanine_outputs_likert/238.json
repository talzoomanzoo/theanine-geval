Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm sorry you had to hear me swear like that. I shouldn't have lost my temper like that.\nNeighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset?\nNeighbors A: It was just something that happened at work. My boss was being unreasonable and I couldn't take it anymore.\nNeighbors B: That's understandable. Have you tried talking to your boss about it?\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I have, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I just feel like I'm stuck in a dead-end job.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A emphasized the importance of maintaining belongings for cost-effectiveness, both indoors and outdoors. This led Neighbors B to appreciate the sense of community that arises from mutual assistance. As a result, Neighbors A and B actively support each other. \nNeighbor A discussed the importance of keeping a tree house clean to prevent insects and spiders from inhabiting it. This topic resonated with Neighbors A and B, who reside in the same neighborhood and often assist each other with various tasks. Consequently, they have cultivated a positive and supportive relationship as neighbors.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some background about the neighbors' relationship, emphasizing their mutual support and community sense. While this information shows Neighbor A and Neighbor B have a supportive relationship, it is not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT which focuses on Neighbor A's work frustrations. Also, the MEMORY includes detailed actions and points, such as maintaining belongings or keeping a tree house clean, that don't contribute substantially to the current conversation about work issues. Some connections could be made regarding the supportive relationship helping to understand frustrations, but overall, the MEMORY doesn't offer much help for generating the next response based on the current context. The MEMORY could be better structured with more relevance to the work-related struggles and frustrations being discussed."
