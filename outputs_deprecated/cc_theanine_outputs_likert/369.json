Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message.\nCo-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of skills, you always present a compelling argument in debates. I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive.\nCo-workers A: Yes, I think it's important to back up your claims with facts and figures. It helps to convince the judge or the audience that you're right.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of convincing people, have you ever been in a physical altercation before?\nCo-workers A: Yes, unfortunately. But that doesn't mean I'm a danger to people. I just don't back down from a fight when I'm standing up for what's right.\nCo-workers B: That's understandable. Speaking of standing up for what's right, do you remember when you asked Karen for money and she was hesitant at first?\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument, which Co-worker B commends them for, recognizing their courage to stand up and defend their beliefs. This leads Co-worker A to offer to take on the project of building a deck for Co-worker B.\n\nCo-worker A plans to present the evidence clearly and persuasively in court, having presented evidence in front of a judge before to support their position, which causes Co-worker A to deny that their reputation influenced Karen's decision to give them money.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I recall that. It took some convincing, but she eventually saw the value in supporting the cause.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information, but it lacks a clear connection and cohesiveness to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY mentions Co-worker A's confidence in collecting evidence and their persuasive presentation skills, which relate to the dialogue about public speaking and presenting arguments. However, the sequence of events is not as clear, and some information seems disconnected, such as the mention of building a deck for Co-worker B, which does not align well with the dialogue context. Additionally, the sentences in the MEMORY do not flow naturally or demonstrate causality or development of the interactions strongly. The MEMORY contains key points, but they are not well organized to facilitate generating an appropriate next response related to the current conversation."
