Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination.\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off.\nNeighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks?\nNeighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else.\nNeighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location?\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home.\nNeighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become.\nNeighbors A: You're right, I need to stop making excuses and just get it done. Thanks for the advice.\nNeighbors B: No problem. Speaking of goals, how's the house project coming along? \n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A built a new house for Neighbor B with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard. This act of kindness helped Neighbor B in creating a new house with amazing features. Neighbor B expressed their appreciation by reminding Neighbor A of their potential to do good things, referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them. This made Neighbor A feel motivated to believe that plants need sunlight, water, and love to thrive. \n\nNeighbor A, who enjoys building houses and finishing them quickly, also possesses skills in manipulation and getting what they want. \n\nNeighbor B, excited about the new project, is looking forward to seeing the finished house. Building the new house was challenging but rewarding for Neighbor A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information that is indirectly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions the house project, which is referenced by Neighbor B in the last line of the dialogue. This establishes a connection between the past interaction (building a house) and the current topic (house project). However, the rest of the MEMORY feels disconnected, as it dives into specifics about the house construction and character traits of Neighbor A (e.g., skills in manipulation) which don't appear related to the dialogue context about procrastination and advice. The memory lacks cohesively structured sentences that clearly demonstrate the development or causality needed for the language model to generate a response that aligns with the conversation's flow regarding goals and projects. More explicit and directly relevant memories related to this recurring theme would be helpful."
