Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Why is your face so red and splotchy, Classmates B? Did you get sunburned?\nClassmates B: No, I didn't get sunburned. I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed.\nClassmates A: Embarrassed? Why?\nClassmates B: It's nothing, really. Just something embarrassing happened to me earlier.\nClassmates A: Come on, tell me! I won't judge you, I promise.\nClassmates B: Well, I accidentally spilled my lunch all over myself in front of some people.\nClassmates A: (laughs) That's it? That's why you're embarrassed? I thought it was something serious.\nClassmates B: (sighs) Yeah, it's silly. But still embarrassing.\nClassmates A: Don't worry about it. It happens to everyone. Remember the time I tripped and fell in front of the whole class during our presentation?\nClassmates B: Oh yeah, that was pretty bad. But you handled it so well. You just got up, dusted yourself off, and continued with the presentation.\nClassmates A: Exactly! That's what you should do too. Own up to it and move on. Don't let it bother you.\nClassmates B: You're right. Thanks, Classmates A. You always know how to make me feel better.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. [Classmates B praised Classmates A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.] - (React) - [Classmates A feels grateful for the recognition and support from Classmates B in a challenging situation in space.]\n\n2. [Classmates A is patient and helpful in teaching driving material to Classmate B.] - (React) - [Classmates B appreciates Classmates A's dedication and assistance in preparing for a driving test, highlighting their supportive nature.]\n\n3. [Classmate A emphasizes the importance of hard work and dedication in improving skills.] - (React) - [Classmates B acknowledges and admires Classmate A's strong work ethic and attention to detail as qualities worth emulating.]\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "No problem, Classmates B. Just remember, we all have embarrassing moments, but it's how we handle them that matters.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains three separate instances of interactions between Classmates A and B, each reflecting different scenarios. However, these scenarios are largely unrelated to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which revolves around handling embarrassment and providing reassurance after an embarrassing incident. The memory involves abstract and distinct themes like space experience, driving test preparation, and work ethic, which do not directly connect to the context of embarrassment in a social situation. The main relevance is that they all highlight positive attributes of Classmate A (resilience, patience, hard work), which tangentially could suggest why Classmate A is reassuring Classmate B, but these connections are not made explicit or easily deducible. The structure of the sentences helps describe the familiarity and supportive nature of Classmate A towards Classmate B, but does not clearly demonstrate how the past interactions directly inform the current situation. Therefore, while some aspects of the MEMORY are phrased naturally and provide subtle character dynamics, overall it is not sufficiently helpful in generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
