    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just tried this breathing exercise and it really helped me relax.\nNeighbors B: What kind of breathing exercise?\nNeighbors A: It's just a simple one, where you inhale for four seconds, hold your breath for seven seconds, and then exhale for eight seconds. I've been doing it every day for the past week and it's made such a difference.\nNeighbors B: That's really interesting. I've heard that breathing exercises can be really helpful for reducing stress and anxiety.\nNeighbors A: Yes, it definitely has helped me with that. Plus, it's something that I can easily do anywhere, whether I'm at home or out running errands.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A surprised Neighbors B with a pizza, showing appreciation for Neighbors B's actions in the neighborhood. In response, Neighbors B values their friendship with Neighbors A and reassures Neighbor A about past embarrassing incidents, emphasizing their current friendship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear. It's always good to have simple techniques like that to help manage stress.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY references a past interaction where Neighbors A appreciated Neighbors B by bringing a pizza. It shows that Neighbors B values their friendship and reassures Neighbors A about past embarrassing incidents. These sentences suggest a positive friendship between the two neighbors, which might be helpful for understanding their relational dynamics. However, it lacks specific relevance to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT focused on breathing exercises for stress relief. There is no direct connection or helpful information provided in MEMORY that supports generating the next response for the given CONTEXT. The sentences are well-phrased, but they don't offer much contextual development or causality related to the breathing exercise topic, hence the relatively low score."
