Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today.\nClassmates B:  That sounds great. What was the talk about?\nClassmates A: It was about the history of the pyramids in Egypt. I learned so much about their construction and the cultural significance they held.\nClassmates B: Wow, that does sound interesting. Did you take any notes?\nClassmates A: Yes, I took lots of notes. I'm excited to study this topic more on my own time.\nClassmates B: That's awesome. It's great to see your enthusiasm for learning.\nClassmates A: Thanks. I've always been passionate about learning new things. Remember when we talked about how determined I was to get into college?\nClassmates B: Yeah, I remember. You were always studying and taking extra classes.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A's dedication to studying hard and taking extra classes to get into a good college has led to their willingness to work hard to achieve their dreams, as well as meeting the girl of their dreams at a party and texting her nonstop.\n2. Classmates A's improvement in their studies, noticed by Classmates B, has resulted in Classmates B being supportive of Classmates A's new relationship and believing they found someone who makes them happy.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "All that hard work paid off in the end. It's amazing how far dedication can take you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information that is somewhat related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but it also introduces new elements that are not directly relevant to the ongoing conversation. The DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses on Classmates A's interest and enthusiasm for learning, particularly about the pyramids in Egypt, and touches on Classmates A's determination to get into college. The MEMORY mentions Classmates A's dedication to studying hard and taking extra classes to get into college, which is relevant to the context. However, it also includes details about Classmates A's personal relationship, which does not contribute directly to generating a response in the current conversation as it stands. Thus, while the MEMORY provides some useful insights into Classmates A's character and background, it is somewhat disjointed when it comes to fully supporting the generation of a potential next response related to the academic discussion. The sentences in the MEMORY are naturally structured, yet they partially drift away from the central theme of learning, which slightly decreases their helpfulness in this context."
