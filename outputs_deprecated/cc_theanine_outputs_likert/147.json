Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just visited this amazing new city. The architecture was stunning, the streets were so clean, and the people were very friendly.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like you had a great time! Which city did you visit?\nNeighbors A: It was Chicago. I had never been before, but it exceeded all my expectations.\nNeighbors B: I bet it was a nice change of scenery from our neighborhood.\nNeighbors A: Definitely. But you know, it's interesting how much our neighborhood has grown on me over the years. I remember when I first moved here, I was so unsure about it.\nNeighbors B: Yeah, I remember. But you stayed because you wanted to be here.\nNeighbors A: That's right. And since then, I've made so many great memories here. It's become my home.\nNeighbors B: And you're still spending time with God every day, right?\nNeighbors A: Yes, I am. It brings me so much peace and happiness.\nNeighbors B: That's really admirable. And speaking of power, I remember you telling me about that time when you could make me do anything you wanted.\nNeighbors A: Oh, gosh. That was so long ago. I can't even believe I had that kind of power over you.\nNeighbors B: I'm just glad we've both grown since then, and we can have a friendship that's based on mutual respect.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A has been living in the same place for a long time and enjoys the neighborhood and people there, appreciating having friendly faces around and hoping to make new friends soon.\nNeighbor B has moved around a lot over the years but is considering settling down in the current neighborhood, feeling comfortable and safe, and has made good friends, including Neighbor A, who values the relationship with them and considers them like family.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, it's been quite a journey for both of us. I'm grateful for our friendship and the growth we've experienced together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides useful background information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Neighbor A's long-term residence in the neighborhood and appreciation for the local community, which aligns with their expressed happiness living there in the conversation. Similarly, Neighbor B's moving history and consideration to settle down in the neighborhood provide context for the dialogue's themes of stability and personal growth. The MEMORY captures the essence of the neighbors' evolving relationship and their mutual appreciation, which complements the interaction in the dialogue, enhancing the model's ability to generate informed responses. However, the MEMORY could be more detailed regarding past specific interactions mentioned in the dialogue, such as the mention of past events and growth, which would make it even more helpful."
