Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Mentor, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends.\nMentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\nMentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here.\nMentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people.\nMentee: Those are good suggestions, Mentor. I'll consider joining a club or volunteering.\nMentor: And remember, it's also important to keep in touch with your old friends. You can schedule video calls or even plan a visit back home.\nMentee: That's true, I'll make sure to keep in touch. Thanks for the advice, Mentor.\nMentor: Anytime, Mentee. Is there anything else you want to talk about or any updates you'd like to share?\nMentee: Actually, I did make a new friend at work. We've been hanging out after work sometimes and it's been nice.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Mentor acknowledges the Mentee's work in advocacy for women and girls and praises their dedication to their values, which caused Mentee to agree to go back to the store to make things right and express gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n2. The Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace, reacting to the Mentor's belief that the Mentee's work has been influential and that they will continue to make an impact in the world.\n3. The Mentor has been guiding and supporting the Mentee in their work for years, leading to the Mentee being offered a job and deciding to take the job in the city.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does not provide useful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which revolves around the Mentee's feelings of loneliness in a new city and the suggestions provided by the Mentor to cope with this. Instead, the MEMORY entries focus on the Mentee's advocacy work and job decisions, which are not relevant to the current conversation. The sentences are not naturally connected to the given context of the DIALOGUE and lack development or causality that could facilitate generating an appropriate next response. Additionally, the information in the MEMORY does not offer any contextual cues that align with the main topic of the conversation about loneliness and forming new connections."
