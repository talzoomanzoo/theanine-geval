Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just visited this amazing new city. The architecture was stunning, the streets were so clean, and the people were very friendly.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like you had a great time! Which city did you visit?\nNeighbors A: It was Chicago. I had never been before, but it exceeded all my expectations.\nNeighbors B: I bet it was a nice change of scenery from our neighborhood.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A and Neighbor B appreciate each other as good neighbors and have organized a block party together in the past. This has caused Neighbors A to enjoy living in the neighborhood, feeling comfortable and safe, and has made good friends, including Neighbors B. Neighbors A values the relationship with Neighbors B and considers them like family. As a result, Neighbors A is excited to explore the neighborhood and make new friends.\n\nNeighbor A has been living in the same place for a long time and enjoys the neighborhood and people there. In response, Neighbors B acknowledges Neighbors A's friendly and outgoing nature.\n\nNeighbor A and Neighbor B appreciate each other as good neighbors and have organized a block party together in the past. This has caused Neighbors A to enjoy living in the neighborhood, feeling comfortable and safe, and has made good friends, including Neighbors B. Neighbors A finds spending time with God brings them peace and happiness, which led to Neighbors A finding a park and a coffee shop nearby that they want to visit.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Neighbors A",
    "raw_prediction": "It was definitely a nice change of pace, but there's still no place like home.",
    "prediction": "3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant background information about the relationship between Neighbors A and B, which may be helpful in generating responsive dialogue. It establishes that they have a friendly relationship, organized a block party together, and consider each other like family. This is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as it pertains to Neighbors A exploring a new city, where similar community values and expectations may apply. However, not all sentences are directly relevant or connected to the current discussion about visitation to Chicago, and there is some repetition. While the MEMORY is well-structured and the information is naturally phrased, it could offer more direct relevance or context to aid in dialog generation better."
