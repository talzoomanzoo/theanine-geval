Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hi there, I was wondering if you'd like to join me for lunch on Tuesday at the school cafeteria.\nCo-workers B: Oh, sure. Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking?\nCo-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for asking me to join you.\nCo-workers A: No problem, it'll be great to catch up. Hey, do you remember when we talked about me being irresponsible a few years ago?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, I remember that conversation. What about it?\nCo-workers A: Well, I wanted to share some good news with you. I've been recently promoted to the night shift and have been doing a great job. I think I've come a long way since those days.\nCo-workers B: That's awesome, congratulations! I'm proud of you and all the hard work you've put in. You've definitely grown and matured in the workplace.\nCo-workers A: Thank you, I appreciate that. But I have to admit, I'm still a bit nervous about being wrong. Remember when we talked about my constantly questioning myself and second-guessing my decisions?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, I remember that. Is there anything specific that's been bothering you?\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B reassures Co-worker A that making mistakes is okay as long as they learn from them. Co-worker B reassures Co-worker A and encourages them to have more confidence.\n\nCo-worker A is trying to be more conscious of how their actions impact others and avoid causing problems for anyone else. Co-worker A takes their job seriously and prioritizes being reliable. Co-worker A is nervous about making mistakes in their new position. Co-worker A expresses nervousness and self-doubt despite their achievements.\n\nCo-worker B mentioned that Co-worker A is responsible in their work, even if not always in other aspects of life. Co-worker B reminds Co-worker A of their progress and potential for success.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided is extremely helpful in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures the essence of past conversations between Co-workers A and B, specifically focusing on Co-worker A's nervousness, self-doubt, and progress at work. These themes are directly relevant to the current dialogue where Co-worker A mentions their personal growth, yet also their ongoing nervousness about being wrong. The MEMORY conveys how Co-worker B has been supportive, which is useful for predicting Co-worker Bâ€™s likely behavior and responses in the current situation. The connections, relevance, and structure of the MEMORY are clearly demonstrated, supporting the flow and coherence of future dialogue generation."
