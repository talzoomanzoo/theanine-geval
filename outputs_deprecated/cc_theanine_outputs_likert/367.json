Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message.\nCo-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of skills, you always present a compelling argument in debates. I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive.\nCo-workers A: Yes, I think it's important to back up your claims with facts and figures. It helps to convince the judge or the audience that you're right.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of convincing people, have you ever been in a physical altercation before?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A's experience of presenting evidence in front of a judge has shaped their determination to present evidence clearly and persuasively in court.\n2. Co-worker A's confidence in the strength of their argument stems from collecting evidence for a case.\n3. Co-worker B admires Co-worker A for standing up and defending their beliefs.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thankfully, I've never been in a physical altercation. I prefer to use words to resolve conflicts whenever possible.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided includes relevant information that can help in generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 1 in the MEMORY references Co-worker A's experience presenting evidence in front of a judge, which connects well with the ongoing dialogue about public speaking, debating, and presenting arguments effectively. Sentence 2 further supports this context by mentioning Co-worker A's confidence in their argument due to their experience in collecting evidence for a case, highlighting the importance of backing up claims with facts and figures as mentioned in the dialogue. Sentence 3 touches on Co-worker B's admiration for Co-worker A's abilities, which is relevant to the positive reinforcement given in the dialogue. Overall, MEMORY is structured naturally and supports the development of the conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making it quite helpful. However, it could be slightly improved by connecting more explicitly to the specific mention of \"persuasiveness\" and \"physical altercation\" in the last part of the dialogue."
