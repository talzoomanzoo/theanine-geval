Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey, can you keep a secret?\nNeighbors B: Of course, what's up?\nNeighbors A: I can't be seen because I am hiding from my mom behind the door.\nNeighbors B: Oh, why are you hiding from her?\nNeighbors A: She wants me to go to a family dinner tonight, but I'm too tired and just want to relax at home.\nNeighbors B: Maybe you should talk to her about it and let her know how you feel.\nNeighbors A: I know, but I don't want to disappoint her.\nNeighbors B: It's important to take care of your own needs and speak up for yourself. Plus, maybe you can compromise and go to the dinner for a little while and then come back home to relax.\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, thanks for the advice.\nNeighbors B: No problem. Speaking of compromise, remember that dinner we went to a few days ago?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors B is interested in Neighbors A's cooking and asks about the vegetables and quinoa preparation. Neighbors A mentions the practical uses of telekinesis, like grabbing things from a distance, which causes Neighbors A to gain the ability to move objects with their mind. \nNeighbors B is open to trying new recipes and is excited to receive the chickpea curry recipe from Neighbors A. This leads to Neighbors A and B joking about the fun aspects of using telekinesis to surprise people, causing Neighbors A to feel overwhelmed but also excited about their new ability.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided is whimsical and does not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Neighbors A is hiding from their mom to avoid a family dinner. The MEMORY speaks of cooking, telekinesis, excitement over new recipes, and transforming mundane tasks with fantastical abilities, none of which are directly relevant or helpful in generating a response to the specific situation outlined in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The connection between the two neighbors shown in the MEMORY is not tied to the issue at hand (the family dinner dilemma), nor does it provide meaningful past interaction information that would aid in creating a coherent next response regarding this issue. While the interactions might help establish a general rapport between A and B, they aren't specifically relevant to the current conversation's theme, which affects the ability to generate helpful responses. However, the MEMORY does include some level of past interactions that could subtly indicate a friendly and understanding dynamic between the neighbors, which is why it doesnâ€™t score a complete 1."
