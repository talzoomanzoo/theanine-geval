Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I just gave my boss the written report. I hope she finds it helpful.\nCo-workers B: Did you make sure to include all the necessary details?\nCo-workers A: Yes, I made sure to cover everything we talked about in the meeting. I even added some extra information that I thought could be useful.\nCo-workers B: That's smart thinking. It shows that you're invested in the company and want to make sure things run smoothly.\nCo-workers A: Thanks. I learned a lot from taking over the family business. It taught me the importance of being efficient and proactive.\nCo-workers B: I remember you telling me about that. It's amazing how much you've accomplished since then.\nCo-workers A: It's been a journey, but I'm glad to see the business flourishing. It gives me a sense of pride and accomplishment.\nCo-workers B: I can tell. You're always trying to find ways to improve things.\nCo-workers A: Exactly. That's why I felt a written report would be the best way to communicate the information to my boss. It saves time and ensures everything is organized.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A's father was hesitant to hand over the business but now trusts Co-worker A, causing Co-worker A to have a family business that has been doing well recently. This led to Co-worker A taking over their family's business a few years ago, and it has improved since then.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant background information about Co-worker A's involvement in the family business, which aligns well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Co-worker A discusses the skills and pride gained from taking over the family business. The MEMORY highlights Co-worker A's father's initial hesitance followed by trust in Co-worker A that resulted in them taking over and improving the business. This supports the dialogue context that touches upon their business management skills, investment in the company, and the pride and accomplishments Co-worker A feels. The sentences in the MEMORY are naturally phrased, clearly reflecting the development of the events that are relevant to the dialogue context. While the MEMORY does not directly address the written report, its focus on Co-worker Aâ€™s business acumen makes it generally beneficial for understanding Co-worker A's motivation and context in their career. However, a small deduction is warranted because it could offer more explicit connection to the context of the report to achieve a perfect score."
