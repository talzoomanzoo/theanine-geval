Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately.\nClassmates B: Why is that?\nClassmates A: I want to be smart and I think algebra can help me think more logically and critically.\nClassmates B: That's a good goal to have. Have you noticed any improvements in your thinking since studying algebra?\nClassmates A: Definitely. I feel like I'm able to break down problems and analyze them more effectively.\nClassmates B: It's always rewarding when hard work pays off.\nClassmates A: Yes it is. It reminds me of when I proved my brother wrong in that race. I was so determined to win and it paid off in the end.\nClassmates B: It's great to see that determination and hard work lead to success in different areas of life.\nClassmates A: And even when I felt that pain in my arm, I waited and it eventually went away.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates A's experience facing tough competition in middle school from a fast girl motivated them to improve, which Classmates B acknowledges by emphasizing the importance of enjoying the journey and effort put in, not just focusing on winning. Both classmates value taking moments to relax and appreciate small things.\n\nClassmates B acknowledges Classmates A's determination and competitiveness, offering support and suggesting that Classmates A get their arm checked out as they had a muscle strain but did not go to the hospital.\n\nClassmates A's motivation to improve from tough competition in middle school was hindered by Classmates B offering support and suggesting they take a step back to find a balance. This support led to Classmates A expressing gratitude for the friendship and support of Classmates B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information that aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, it references Classmates A's determination and competitiveness, which relates to A's goal of improving through studying algebra. Additionally, the suggestion from Classmates B to get Aâ€™s arm checked out for a potential muscle strain connects to the mention of A feeling pain in their arm in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY could be more organized and clearer in outlining the past interactions between the classmates. Some sentences are less directly relevant to the immediate flow of the conversation, and connections between these events and the current dialogue are not fully developed, so the language model might have difficulty leveraging all parts of the MEMORY effectively. A higher score would require a clearer articulation of the successful development and causality of past interactions that directly enrich the ongoing dialogue context."
