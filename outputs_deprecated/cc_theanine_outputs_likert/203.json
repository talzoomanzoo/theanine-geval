Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager!\nCo-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge.\nCo-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail.\nCo-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of new products, remember when you used to fantasize about being a great leader?\nCo-workers A: Ha, yeah. That seems like ages ago.\nCo-workers B: Well, now you can finally take on that leadership role and make your dreams a reality.\nCo-workers A: That's true. It's amazing how life works out sometimes. But it hasn't always been smooth sailing. Remember when I was really stressed about you not liking me?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, I remember. But we worked through it, didn't we?\nCo-workers A: We definitely did. And it taught me to just take things one step at a time, like I am with this new role.\nCo-workers B: Exactly, and I'm sure you'll apply that same mentality to your training as well. I remember you were really dedicated to it a couple of years ago.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B believes that Co-worker A has the potential to be a great leader if they use their power for good. This aligns with Co-worker A's aspirations of being a great leader and emphasizing the importance of communication.\n\nCo-worker B encourages Co-worker A to consider pursuing a leadership position and highlights the qualities of a good leader. In response, Co-worker B acknowledges the importance of communication and resolving conflicts, which prompts Co-worker A to calm down and have a conversation with Co-worker B.\n\nCo-worker A has fantasies of being a great leader, which is related to their feeling stressed about their relationship with Co-worker B. This stress is a result of Co-worker A feeling embarrassed for losing control of their emotions in the past.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, I've always believed in the power of growth and learning from past experiences. I'm ready to tackle this new challenge head-on and continue to develop my leadership skills.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information that supports the generation of a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY reflects the past interactions and dynamics between the two co-workers, focusing on Co-worker A's leadership aspirations and the challenges they have faced. It aligns with the current dialogue that touches on Co-worker A's new leadership role and the previous issues of stress and relationship dynamics with Co-worker B.\n\nThe MEMORY includes:\n- Co-worker B's belief in Co-worker A's potential, which ties into Co-worker A's promotion and leadership role in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n- Encouragement from Co-worker B and a focus on important traits like communication and conflict resolution, which relate to Co-worker A's current feelings of being ready for their new role.\n- Co-worker A's past stress about the relationship with Co-worker B, aligning with the current mention of having worked through those issues.\n\nThe MEMORY is structured in a way that is naturally phrased and interconnected, allowing the language model to derive useful contextual cues relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making it easier for language models to grasp the development and relationships at play. However, some sentences may repeat information (e.g., Co-worker A's aspirations) or slightly deviate from the exact details of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which prevents it from receiving the highest score."
