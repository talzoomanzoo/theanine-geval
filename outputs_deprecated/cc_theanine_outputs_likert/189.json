Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, have you checked out my new blog? It's all about promoting under-the-radar artists.\nClassmates B: I haven't had a chance to yet, but that sounds really cool! What inspired you to start it?\nClassmates A: Well, I've always had a passion for the arts, but I was too afraid to pursue it. I finally realized that it's what I really love, and I wanted to share that love with others.\nClassmates B: That's amazing. It takes a lot of courage to pursue your passions like that.\nClassmates A: Yeah, it was scary at first, but the response has been really positive. I'm so glad I finally decided to take the leap.\nClassmates B: I'm proud of you. It's always great to see someone following their dreams.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates B wants to offer help and support to Classmates A in the future. Classmates A values independence, focuses on their own happiness, and has been pursuing their passions, enjoying life. Classmates A and B both value trying new things, taking risks for personal development, living authentically, and being content with their choices.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as it highlights the values and characteristics of Classmates A and B that align with the conversation. It emphasizes themes discussed in the context, such as taking risks, pursuing passions, and living authentically. These connections provide a language model with useful cues to generate a suitable response that continues the themes introduced. However, the MEMORY remains slightly abstract and generalized without specific prior events or interactions, which could enhance the model's ability to generate more context-specific responses. Nonetheless, the overall consistency with the dialogue's themes makes it largely helpful."
