Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, how are you feeling today?\nClassmates B: I'm feeling frustrated. I wish I could do things on my own.\nClassmates A: I understand how you feel. It can be tough when you feel like you're dependent on others.\nClassmates B: Yeah, exactly. I don't want to be a burden on anyone.\nClassmates A: You're not a burden, don't worry. And I'm always here to help you out.\nClassmates B: I appreciate that, but I don't want to always rely on others. I want to be more independent.\nClassmates A: I get it. Maybe there are some small things you can do on your own to start feeling more independent?\nClassmates B: Like what?\nClassmates A: Well, maybe you can start by making a list of things you'd like to do on your own and we can work on achieving those goals together.\nClassmates B: That sounds like a good idea. Thanks for understanding, Classmates A.\nClassmates A: Of course, I'm always here to support you. Hey, speaking of goals, remember when we talked about your guitar playing a few months ago? How's that going?\nClassmates B: It's going really well, thanks for asking! I've been practicing every day and I feel like I'm getting better.\nClassmates A: That's awesome! Have you thought about joining a band or playing gigs around town?\nClassmates B: Not really, I'm still a bit nervous about performing in front of people.\nClassmates A: I get it, performing can be scary. But maybe in a few months, we can work on setting a goal for you to do a small performance somewhere.\nClassmates B: That sounds like a challenge, but also kind of exciting. I'm in!\nClassmates A: Great, I'm looking forward to seeing you rock out on stage. Hey, remember when we talked about your new car a few hours ago? How's that going?\nClassmates B: I'm loving it! It's so much fun to drive. Thanks for asking, Classmates A.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates A and B have a supportive and friendly relationship, as shown by their conversation about their experiences with homework in math class. \nClassmates B is excited that Classmates A is pursuing their passion for music after discussing following dreams. As a result, they plan to collaborate on music in the future and enjoy jamming together. \nClassmates A, who plays the guitar, takes lessons, and is in a band, wants to celebrate the new car with Classmates B over a drink. They both enjoy driving, with Classmates B finding it fun and freeing to drive their recently bought red sports car.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad to hear you're enjoying your new car! Maybe we can go for a drive together sometime to celebrate your independence and have some fun.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Classmates A and B's supportive and friendly relationship, which is consistent with the supportive tone in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY also mentions Classmates A's involvement in music, playing the guitar, and being in a band, which aligns with Classmates B's discussion about practicing guitar and the idea of performing. However, MEMORY introduces details not present in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the plan to collaborate on music and celebrate the new car over drinks, which are not mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. These details are extraneous and not directly relevant, which slightly diminishes the overall helpfulness. The structure of the MEMORY provides some connections and development of the relationship between Classmates A and B, but the introduction of additional elements without clear ties to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT could confuse a language model. Therefore, while MEMORY does provide some relevant context, the additional unrelated information reduces its overall helpfulness."
