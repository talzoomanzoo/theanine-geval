Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Can you believe it? I'm a millionaire now!\nNeighbors B: Wow, that's incredible! How did it happen?\nNeighbors A: I inherited it from a distant relative. It's still sinking in, to be honest.\nNeighbors B: That's amazing, congratulations! What are you going to do with all that money?\nNeighbors A: Well, first I'm going to pay off my mortgage and all my debts. After that, I think I'll take a nice long vacation and maybe donate some to charity.\nNeighbors B: That's very generous of you. Have you thought about investing any of it?\nNeighbors A: Yes, actually. I've been doing some research and I think I want to invest in some stocks and maybe even start my own business.\nNeighbors B: That sounds like a great idea. You have the opportunity to do so much with your newfound wealth.\nNeighbors A: Definitely. It's funny how things can change so quickly. Just a few years ago, I was stuck in a job I hated and now I have all this freedom.\nNeighbors B: Speaking of jobs, have you thought about what you want to do now? You don't really have to work if you don't want to.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Neighbors A made a big career change recently and is much happier now. They are planning to start looking for new opportunities soon, updating their resume, and networking.\n- Neighbors A took the leap to make a change and is glad they did. Feeling stagnant in their current job, they are looking for more growth and challenge.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some information about Neighbor A's career change and their feelings about their current job, which provides a background that Neighbor A has been considering their professional life recently. This can be somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as Neighbor B asks if Neighbor A has thought about what they want to do now, following their newfound financial freedom, and Neighbor A mentions their previous unhappiness with their job. However, the MEMORY is focused on Neighbor A's past career dissatisfaction and plans for transformation which might not directly impact the current conversation as much as details about the inheritance or their immediate monetary plans might do.\n\nThe MEMORY could be made more helpful by including more direct references to the financial changes or any related discussions they had regarding investments or financial freedom. Despite this, the MEMORYâ€™s phrases are naturally structured, so it does provide some assistance in understanding Neighbor A's mindset and aspirations outside of the immediate financial context."
