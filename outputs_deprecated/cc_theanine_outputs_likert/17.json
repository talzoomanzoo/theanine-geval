Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Mentor, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends.\nMentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\nMentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here.\nMentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people.\nMentee: Those are good suggestions, Mentor. I'll consider joining a club or volunteering.\nMentor: And remember, it's also important to keep in touch with your old friends. You can schedule video calls or even plan a visit back home.\nMentee: That's true, I'll make sure to keep in touch. Thanks for the advice, Mentor.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Mentor has been guiding and supporting the Mentee in their work for years. As a result, the Mentee agreed to go back to the store to make things right and expressed gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n\n2. The Mentor believes the Mentee's work has been influential and that they will continue to make an impact in the world. In response, Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace.\n\n3. The Mentor believes the Mentee's work has been influential and that they will continue to make an impact in the world. The Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process, and subsequently, Mentee is feeling overwhelmed with the college application process. This situation is similar to when Mentee took shoes from the store without paying because they couldn't afford them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "You're welcome, Mentee. Remember, I'm always here to support you through these transitions. Just take it one step at a time, and things will fall into place.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some elements that could be relevant, like the idea of guidance and support given by the Mentor, which relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where the Mentor offers advice for the Mentee's loneliness in a new city. However, the specific events and examples in the MEMORY, such as going back to a store to make things right and the college application process, do not relate directly to the current context about adjusting to a new city and making friends. The connections between the sentences are unclear, and there is a lack of direct applicability to the current dilemma of making new friends and maintaining old relationships. Consequently, while there are some underlying themes that could be useful, the specific details within the MEMORY are not structured in a way that supports the next response generation in the context effectively."
