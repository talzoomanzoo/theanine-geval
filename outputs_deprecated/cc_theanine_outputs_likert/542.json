    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, check out this spot I found to camp out for the night. It's perfect!\nClassmates B: Wow, this view is amazing!\nClassmates A: I know, right? And it's completely level and free of any debris. We won't have to worry about rolling off our sleeping pads or anything like that.\nClassmates B: It definitely looks like a great spot to spend the night. How did you manage to find it?\nClassmates A: Just a stroke of luck, I guess. I was exploring the area and stumbled upon it. It's always good to be a little adventurous and explore new places, you never know what you might find.\nClassmates B: That's true. You always seem to find the best spots. Like that time we went camping near the lake and had the whole place to ourselves.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates A's proactive and curious nature leads them to research topics of interest, sparking a realization that their current allergic reaction might be related to previous discussions on allergies. \nClassmates A's involvement in the community inspires Classmate B to emphasize the importance of being cautious with allergies and taking necessary precautions to prevent severe reactions.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That was such a memorable trip! I love finding hidden gems like this spot. It really makes the adventure more exciting.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does not contain any sentences that are directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The dialogue context discusses a camping trip and how Classmate A found an excellent camping spot, while the MEMORY is focused on allergic reactions and community involvement, which are entirely unrelated topics. Additionally, the MEMORY does not offer any connections, causality, or developments between Classmates A and B's past interactions that would be beneficial for generating a proper next response in the given context. Therefore, the MEMORY is generally not helpful for generating the next part of the conversation linked to the camping trip."
