    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Can you believe it? I'm a millionaire now!\nNeighbors B: Wow, that's incredible! How did it happen?\nNeighbors A: I inherited it from a distant relative. It's still sinking in, to be honest.\nNeighbors B: That's amazing, congratulations! What are you going to do with all that money?\nNeighbors A: Well, first I'm going to pay off my mortgage and all my debts. After that, I think I'll take a nice long vacation and maybe donate some to charity.\nNeighbors B: That's very generous of you. Have you thought about investing any of it?\nNeighbors A: Yes, actually. I've been doing some research and I think I want to invest in some stocks and maybe even start my own business.\nNeighbors B: That sounds like a great idea. You have the opportunity to do so much with your newfound wealth.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A is tired from work and needs to catch up on sleep. This causes Neighbors A to feel stagnant in their current job and look for more growth and challenge, leading to a big career change that makes them much happier now. Neighbors B has been supportive of Neighbors A's job search, offering to connect them with people in different industries, and admires the courage it took.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some background information about Neighbors A's job dissatisfaction and the support from Neighbors B, which could potentially provide some context about Neighbors A's motivation and their relationship with Neighbors B. However, it is not directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Neighbors A inheriting money and what they plan to do with it. The sentences in the memory are somewhat connected in terms of causality in Neighbors A's career change, but this doesn't align well with their current conversation about newfound wealth and investment plans. The MEMORY would be more helpful if it contained information related to financial discussions or personal growth aspirations tied to wealth management, which are key themes in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
