    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I can't believe how honored I am to be part of our class. I feel like we have something special going on here.\nClassmates B:  You're right. Our class definitely has a unique energy about it. What do you think sets us apart from other classes?\nClassmates A:  I think it's our sense of community. We all support each other and work together to achieve our goals.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate A finally confesses their love to Classmate B, who responds by complimenting their suit and discussing past conversations about feelings.\n2. Classmate B appreciates Classmate A's honesty about their feelings, but unfortunately, does not feel the same way, causing Classmate A to feel heartbroken.\n3. While Classmate B enjoys people watching at the mall, they are relieved to still be friends with Classmate A, who is looking forward to a fun night out at a wedding reception wearing a black suit.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains some sentences that indicate interactions between Classmates A and B, which could help in understanding their relationship dynamic to some extent. However, the majority of the MEMORY focuses on a romantic interaction between the two that does not seem directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The current dialogue is about the sense of community and unique energy in their class, and the MEMORY discusses personal feelings and social outings that do not contribute to this specific context. The sentences in MEMORY are somewhat connected, but the details provided are not particularly helpful for generating a response to the topic being discussed in DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is about the spirit of their classroom environment rather than their personal romantic relationship."
