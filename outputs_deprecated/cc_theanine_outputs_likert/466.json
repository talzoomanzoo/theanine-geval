    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just got back from my trip to South America. It was amazing!\nNeighbors B: Oh really? Where did you go?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A and B both believe in the importance of learning and self-improvement. They also believe in doing nice things for others to bring the community together. Additionally, Neighbors A is very organized in their room and house and never wastes time searching for things. Neighbors A and B took a cooking class together last year, and Neighbor B remembers the incident. Neighbor B mentions struggling with keeping their room tidy and wasting time looking for things. Furthermore, Neighbor B expresses concern about the safety of hooking up with strangers and advises caution.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY does not provide much relevant information for generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The details about both neighbors' beliefs in learning and community involvement, as well as information about their personal habits, do not directly relate to the context of Neighbors A returning from a trip to South America. While it is noted that Neighbors A and B took a cooking class together, which suggests a past shared experience, this information is not particularly helpful for continuing the present conversation about the trip. The MEMORY lacks specific detail relevant to travel or any shared experiences that would enrich a response regarding the trip Neighbors A just returned from. The sentences are somewhat disconnected and don't provide a clear development or causality related to the context, which makes them less effective in aiding a language model to generate a meaningful and contextually appropriate next response."
