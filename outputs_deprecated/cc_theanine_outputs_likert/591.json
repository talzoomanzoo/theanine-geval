    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Wife, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I'm feeling stuck with my writing. I've been searching everywhere for new ideas, but nothing seems to work.\nWife: Have you tried brainstorming with me? Sometimes bouncing ideas off of someone else can help.\nHusband: I have, but I don't want to bother you too much with my writing stuff.\nWife: Nonsense! You can always come to me with anything. Plus, I enjoy helping you with your creative process. Have you also tried revisiting some of the writing prompts we did in our creative writing class?\nHusband: I have, but I feel like I'm just repeating the same stories over and over again.\nWife: Maybe it's time to take a step back and try something new. Have you ever tried writing in a different genre or experimenting with different styles?\nHusband: That's a good idea. I guess I just haven't had the courage to step out of my comfort zone.\n\nMEMORY:\nThe husband and wife both express a desire for happiness and understanding in the situation, showing a willingness to support each other. The wife reassures the husband that it's okay to be different and encourages him to embrace who he is. The husband agrees to try adapting to modern language for better communication with his wife. The husband, who gave a fifth-grade presentation in the past, is open to learning more about movies and trying again.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Stepping out of your comfort zone can lead to new and exciting discoveries. Maybe trying a different genre will spark some fresh ideas for you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some sentences that might provide a general sense of the relationship's supportive dynamic between the husband and wife, which is slightly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the specific details mentioned in MEMORY, such as the husband's past experiences with presentations and adapting to modern language, do not directly connect to the current conversation about writing challenges and exploring new genres. Overall, the MEMORY lacks a direct and clear connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, resulting in limited helpfulness for generating a suitable next response. Most of the MEMORY data seems disjointed and not crucial for understanding or advancing the given dialogue, leading to a low score."
