    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey, can you keep a secret?\nNeighbors B: Of course, what's up?\nNeighbors A: I can't be seen because I am hiding from my mom behind the door.\nNeighbors B: Oh, why are you hiding from her?\nNeighbors A: She wants me to go to a family dinner tonight, but I'm too tired and just want to relax at home.\nNeighbors B: Maybe you should talk to her about it and let her know how you feel.\nNeighbors A: I know, but I don't want to disappoint her.\nNeighbors B: It's important to take care of your own needs and speak up for yourself. Plus, maybe you can compromise and go to the dinner for a little while and then come back home to relax.\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, thanks for the advice.\nNeighbors B: No problem. Speaking of compromise, remember that dinner we went to a few days ago?\nNeighbors A: Yes, it was so much fun!\nNeighbors B: I'm glad you enjoyed it. Maybe we can make it a regular thing and try out new restaurants together.\nNeighbors A: That sounds great! And it gives me something to look forward to after work.\nNeighbors B: Speaking of work, how are you feeling about your job lately?\nNeighbors A: Honestly, still a bit unfulfilled. But I've been thinking about exploring some new opportunities and seeing what else is out there.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A enjoys cooking and made roasted vegetables and quinoa for dinner. Neighbor A enjoys trying new things, like new recipes. Neighbor B offers support and suggests planning a dinner to celebrate Neighbor A's new adventures in learning.\n\nNeighbors B is interested in Neighbors A's cooking and asks about the vegetables and quinoa preparation. Neighbors A and B joke about the fun aspects of using telekinesis to surprise people. Neighbors A has been practicing moving small objects with their telekinesis.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's a good idea. It's always important to keep growing and challenging yourself. Have you thought about what kind of opportunities you might be interested in exploring?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about Neighbors A's interests in cooking and trying new things, which could be tangentially related to the context of talking about dinners and new experiences. However, the MEMORY does not effectively support the generation of a relevant response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT as it does not directly link to the specific situation of hiding from the family dinner or exploring job opportunities. The information about telekinesis and practice is irrelevant to the current dialogue, leading to a low score. Overall, while there is some natural phrasing in the MEMORY, the lack of direct relevancy and development detracts from its helpfulness in generating a coherent and contextually appropriate response."
