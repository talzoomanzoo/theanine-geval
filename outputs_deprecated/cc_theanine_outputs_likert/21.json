Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A and B are on friendly terms and enjoy spending time together. They have known each other for years and have become good friends. Neighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A. \nNeighbors A and B have not seen each other in a while and are catching up. They have had conversations about the temperature in the house and how it feels hotter outside. Neighbor A's mom scolds them for ripping off the tag from their new shirt. \nNeighbors B enjoys cooking and suggests making something together. They suggest having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides a general context that Neighbors A and B are on friendly terms and have known each other for years, which aligns with the playful and informal interaction in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This helps establish a baseline for the tone of their interactions. However, the specific details in the MEMORY, such as Neighbor B being comforting and supportive, or the mention of cooking and lawn mowing, do not directly relate to the water incident in the dialogue. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it included past interactions that were directly relevant to playful or teasing behaviors, or if it more clearly demonstrated the dynamics that led to the current scenario. While the overall portrayal of a friendly relationship is accurate, the specific elements provided donâ€™t significantly aid in generating a direct and contextually relevant response in this particular dialogue."
