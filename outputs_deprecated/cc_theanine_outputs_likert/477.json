Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately.\nClassmates B: Why is that?\nClassmates A: I want to be smart and I think algebra can help me think more logically and critically.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A is struggling with feeling competitive and the need to be the best at everything. As a result, Classmates A has not experienced similar pains in the past and is feeling worried about the situation.\n2. Classmates A is always looking to challenge themselves and improve their skills. In response, Classmates B offers support and suggests taking a step back to find a balance. Despite that, Classmates A had a muscle strain in their arm but did not go to the hospital.\n3. Classmates A is experiencing sudden pain in their left arm and is considering going to the hospital after Classmates B offers support and suggests taking a step back to find a balance. However, Classmate B reminds Classmate A to trust their instincts and know when to seek medical attention.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's a great approach! It's important to challenge yourself and develop those critical thinking skills. Just remember to take breaks and find a balance to avoid burnout.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides limited helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY entries primarily focus on Classmates A's competitive nature, desire for self-improvement, and past physical ailment, which are only tangentially related to the specific subject of algebra studies mentioned in the context. While these points reveal some aspects of Classmates A's personality—such as ambition and a tendency to push themselves—they do not directly aid in generating a response that addresses Classmates A's current interest in using algebra to think more logically and critically. Additionally, the structure of the MEMORY entries lacks a clear connection to the topic discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making it harder for a language model to extract pertinent cues to generate an appropriate response."
