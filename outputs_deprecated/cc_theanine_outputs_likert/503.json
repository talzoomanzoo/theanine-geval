Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hi there, I was wondering if you'd like to join me for lunch on Tuesday at the school cafeteria.\nCo-workers B: Oh, sure. Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking?\nCo-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for asking me to join you.\nCo-workers A: No problem, it'll be great to catch up. Hey, do you remember when we talked about me being irresponsible a few years ago?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, I remember that conversation. What about it?\nCo-workers A: Well, I wanted to share some good news with you. I've been recently promoted to the night shift and have been doing a great job. I think I've come a long way since those days.\nCo-workers B: That's awesome, congratulations! I'm proud of you and all the hard work you've put in. You've definitely grown and matured in the workplace.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A has made mistakes in the past but is trying to be more aware of their actions. This has caused Co-worker B to move on from their arrest and appreciate Co-worker A's concern and change in behavior. They both discuss Co-worker A's progress and potential for success.\n\nCo-worker A has made mistakes in the past but is trying to be more aware of their actions. As a result, Co-worker A is adjusting to the night shift schedule and excited for a promotion.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks, I really appreciate your support and encouragement. It means a lot coming from you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It effectively captures the essence of Co-worker A's past mistakes and their efforts to improve, which aligns with Co-worker A's mention of being called irresponsible a few years ago and their subsequent promotion. The MEMORY explains Co-worker A's heightened awareness and their excitement about the promotion, paralleling the context where Co-worker A shares the news of their promotion and personal growth. Although the mention of Co-worker B moving on from an arrest is not relevant to the current dialogue, the rest of the MEMORY is well-structured and relates directly to the themes of improvement and success, aiding in the generation of a coherent response. Overall, the MEMORY demonstrates a clear development of Co-worker A's journey, which is beneficial for understanding the dialogue context."
