Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I just gave my boss the written report. I hope she finds it helpful.\nCo-workers B: Did you make sure to include all the necessary details?\nCo-workers A: Yes, I made sure to cover everything we talked about in the meeting. I even added some extra information that I thought could be useful.\nCo-workers B: That's smart thinking. It shows that you're invested in the company and want to make sure things run smoothly.\nCo-workers A: Thanks. I learned a lot from taking over the family business. It taught me the importance of being efficient and proactive.\nCo-workers B: I remember you telling me about that. It's amazing how much you've accomplished since then.\nCo-workers A: It's been a journey, but I'm glad to see the business flourishing. It gives me a sense of pride and accomplishment.\nCo-workers B: I can tell. You're always trying to find ways to improve things.\nCo-workers A: Exactly. That's why I felt a written report would be the best way to communicate the information to my boss. It saves time and ensures everything is organized.\nCo-workers B: Makes sense. I'm sure your boss will appreciate your efforts.\nCo-workers A: I hope so. I just want to make sure we're all on the same page and working towards our goals.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A took over the family business and made changes to adapt to modern times, leading to the business flourishing recently.\n2. Co-worker A's father was hesitant to hand over the business but now trusts Co-worker A, resulting in the family business doing well recently.\n3. Co-worker A gave Co-worker B a pen as a thoughtful gesture, which symbolizes trust in their professional relationship and is still being used.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY is somewhat helpful for generating a next response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It provides relevant information about Co-worker A's background in running a family business, which is mentioned in the dialogue as a source of the skills A uses in the present work environment. The details about A taking over and flourishing in the family business (MEMORY 1) have already been discussed in the dialogue, reinforcing its relevance. However, sentences 2 and 3 are less directly applicable to the current conversation. While sentence 2 provides insight into familial trust and dynamics, which are not explored in the context, sentence 3 about the pen and symbolism in A and B's relationship is not connected to the dialogue. Overall, while the MEMORY contains useful information that relates to A's background, its utility is somewhat limited by sentences that do not directly pertain to the current flow of conversation or provide useful contextual cues for expanding the topic at hand."
