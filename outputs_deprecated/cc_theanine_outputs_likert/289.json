    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Student, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn.\nTeacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation?\nStudent: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle.\nTeacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time?\nStudent: Really? Maybe I should try to build up my tolerance then.\nTeacher: It could be worth a try. Speaking of trying new things, how's your language studying going?\nStudent: It's going pretty well. I started with French, but now I'm considering taking up Spanish and German too. I want to become more well-rounded.\nTeacher: That's a great goal. Have you thought about any specific ways you could use your language skills?\n\nMEMORY:\nThe student had a heroic experience at the beach where they helped save a young kid from drowning. This made the student feel rewarded by the experience and emphasized the importance of being aware of surroundings and acting quickly in emergencies. \nThe student is looking forward to retirement and spending time with their grandchildren. The student wants to become more well-rounded by studying French at college and plans on learning Spanish and German as well. \nThe student believes in the importance of continuous learning and growth.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information for generating a proper response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly concerning the student's interest in language learning. However, the most relevant part of the MEMORY is the student's desire to become more well-rounded by studying French, Spanish, and German, which was already mentioned in the dialogue. Other parts of the MEMORY, such as the heroic beach experience and their future retirement plans, do not align with the ongoing conversation about hot sauce, spice tolerance, and language learning. While these details are naturally phrased and informative, they do not directly contribute to developing the current dialogue's contextual cues. Overall, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful but lacks direct connections to the ongoing conversation."
