Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message.\nCo-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of skills, you always present a compelling argument in debates. I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument. This experience has led to Co-worker A presenting evidence in front of a judge to support their position in the past, where they denied that their reputation had any impact on Karen giving them the money.\n   \n2. Co-worker A plans to present the evidence clearly and persuasively in court, which has already changed to Co-worker A having presented evidence in front of a judge to support their position in the past. In that instance, Co-worker A denied that their reputation had any impact on Karen giving them the money.\n   \n3. Co-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument. This has led Co-worker B to commend Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs, resulting in Co-worker A being willing to take on the project of building a deck for Co-worker B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate that, thank you. It's important to present information clearly and convincingly, especially in a courtroom setting.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides information that is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes details about Co-worker A's experiences with presenting evidence in a legal setting, which ties into the context of public speaking and persuasion mentioned in the dialogue. However, the memory lacks clear and natural development; the sentences feel somewhat repetitive and do not clearly demonstrate causality or a coherent sequence of events. There is some attempt at establishing a connection with Co-worker B's commendation, but it does not directly align with the conversation context about public speaking skills. Additionally, the segment about Co-worker A building a deck for Co-worker B feels unrelated to both the dialogue and the rest of the MEMORY. Improvements in clarity and logical flow could enhance the memory's helpfulness."
