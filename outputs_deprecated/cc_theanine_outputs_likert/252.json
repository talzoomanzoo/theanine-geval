Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend!\nCo-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while.\nCo-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing?\nCo-workers A: I sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites.\nCo-workers B: That's such a beautiful song. You have a great voice.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! It was really nerve-wracking, but I'm glad I did it.\nCo-workers B: I'm sure the audience loved it. You've really got some talent.\nCo-workers A: Thanks again. It's just something I do for fun, but it's nice to know people enjoy it.\nCo-workers B: Definitely. It's great to have a hobby like that. Reminds me of when you uncovered that mystery a while back. You always seem to surprise us with your skills.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Co-worker A and Co-worker B reminisced about happy memories from their time working together, sparking joy in their conversation.\n- Co-worker A, described as having \"Sherlock Holmes-like skills,\" expressed a desire to celebrate their detective work with drinks after work, hinting at their enjoyment of solving mysteries.\n- Co-worker A's talent for solving puzzles and mysteries was highlighted, leading to discussions about potentially pursuing a career as a detective.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Haha, I guess I do have a knack for uncovering things. Maybe I missed my calling as a detective!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some degree of helpful information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as it identifies Co-worker A's talents and skills, such as solving puzzles and mysteries, which are indirectly connected to the current conversation about singing. Although the MEMORY doesn't directly relate to singing, it showcases Co-worker A's range of abilities, reinforcing the theme of surprising skills mentioned by Co-worker B. However, the connection isn't strongly evident or directly mentioned within the MEMORY, and more context specific to singing could be beneficial to earn a higher score. Overall, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful, but it could better demonstrate the development or causality of past interactions specifically relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
