Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm really excited about finding a buyer for my product. I think it has a lot of potential.\nNeighbors B: That's great to hear, what kind of product is it?\nNeighbors A: It's a new type of workout equipment that's designed to be more efficient than traditional equipment. I've been working on it for months now and I really think it's going to take off.\nNeighbors B: Wow, that sounds interesting. Have you started looking for potential buyers?\nNeighbors A: Yes, I've been reaching out to various gyms and fitness centers to see if they'd be interested in carrying the product. I've even gotten some positive feedback from a few places.\nNeighbors B: That's awesome! I'm sure with your determination, you'll find the perfect buyer soon.\nNeighbors A: Thanks, I really appreciate your support. It's been a long road, but I'm confident that all my hard work will pay off.\nNeighbors B: Speaking of hard work, have you made any progress at your current job? I remember you were having some trouble with your boss.\nNeighbors A: Yeah, unfortunately things didn't work out and I was let go. But I'm trying to look at it as an opportunity to focus on my own business ventures.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A agreed to take responsibility for their actions and work on improving themselves, which led Neighbors B to advise them to change their behavior at work and be a responsible adult. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's efforts to change and become a better version of themselves, and appreciated Neighbors A's support during a difficult situation. \n\nNeighbors B expresses a desire for Neighbors A to succeed and emphasizes the importance of treating others with respect and putting in effort at work. This led Neighbors B to advise Neighbors A to change their behavior at work and be a responsible adult, causing Neighbors A to try to improve their behavior at work and be a better colleague. \n\nNeighbors B expresses a desire for Neighbors A to succeed and emphasizes the importance of treating others with respect and putting in effort at work. This desire is similar to a story about a girl who used to sneak out of her house that Neighbors B is familiar with, but Neighbors B just got back in town and was unaware of the dog's disappearance.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some elements that might be relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Neighbors B supporting Neighbors A's efforts to improve and succeed. However, the memory is cluttered with redundant and poorly structured information that does not clearly relate to the current dialogue context. For example, there is a repetition of how Neighbors B wants Neighbors A to succeed, which dilutes the focus of the memory. Additionally, some parts of the memory seem out of place or unrelated, such as the anecdote about a girl sneaking out of the house and the mention of a dog's disappearance, making it challenging for a language model to identify useful information. Overall, the memory lacks coherence and clarity, limiting its usefulness in generating a next response."
