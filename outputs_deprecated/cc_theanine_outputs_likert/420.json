Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel so grateful to have a boss who is always so supportive of me.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B emphasized the importance of learning from mistakes and working together as a team, which made Co-worker A grateful for life experiences and open to new possibilities in the future.\n2. Co-worker A felt remorse for what they did and appreciated Co-worker B's understanding, leading to personal and artistic growth in terms of empathy and compassion.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, our boss really knows how to lift us up and help us grow. It makes a big difference in our work environment.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful context, showcasing the dynamic between Co-worker A and Co-worker B. Sentence 1 demonstrates thematic elements of working together and learning, which could be relevant to a conversation about supportive environments. Sentence 2 adds another layer, showcasing Co-worker B's understanding and Co-worker A’s personal growth, aligning with the theme of appreciation that Co-worker A expresses in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the connection between MEMORY and the specific expression of gratitude towards the boss in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT isn’t direct or explicit, making it moderately helpful rather than highly so. The sentences are naturally phrased and connected but can be less directly relevant to generating the exact next response in this context."
