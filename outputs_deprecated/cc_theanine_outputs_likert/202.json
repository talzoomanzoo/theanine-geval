Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager!\nCo-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge.\nCo-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail.\nCo-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of new products, remember when you used to fantasize about being a great leader?\nCo-workers A: Ha, yeah. That seems like ages ago.\nCo-workers B: Well, now you can finally take on that leadership role and make your dreams a reality.\nCo-workers A: That's true. It's amazing how life works out sometimes. But it hasn't always been smooth sailing. Remember when I was really stressed about you not liking me?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, I remember. But we worked through it, didn't we?\nCo-workers A: We definitely did. And it taught me to just take things one step at a time, like I am with this new role.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B encourages Co-worker A to consider pursuing a leadership position and highlights the qualities of a good leader. Co-worker A used to fantasize about being a great leader and being respected and admired.\n\nCo-worker B encourages Co-worker A to consider pursuing a leadership position and highlights the qualities of a good leader. Co-worker A felt stressed about their relationship with Co-worker B in the past, causing Co-worker A to feel embarrassed for losing control of their emotions.\n\nCo-worker A considers taking on more responsibility at work as a start towards being a leader. Co-worker A has grown and become more confident over the years.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's all part of the journey, and look where you are now. I have no doubt you'll excel in your new position.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Co-worker A's previous stress about their relationship with Co-worker B and their past desire to become a leader, which is now realized with Co-worker A's promotion. This information aligns with the dialogue context where Co-worker A discusses being nervous about their new role and Co-worker B's encouragement. However, the MEMORY could be more naturally structured to demonstrate clear development and causality. Redundant information (e.g., the repeated mention of Co-worker B encouraging leadership) could be avoided, and more explicit connections between past encouragement and current role could enhance coherence. Additionally, the sentences lack the fluidity that might assist a language model in predicting nuances of future dialogue effectively."
