Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Child, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life.\nChild: Yeah, I think listening is really important too. I always feel heard when I talk to you.\nParent: That's great to hear. I think listening is especially important when people are going through a tough time. It can make a big difference to feel like someone is really hearing you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Parent found hope and appreciated small moments even in difficult situations, which causes the parent to mention making mistakes in the past and trying to turn their life around.\n2. The Child is supportive and caring towards the parent, feeling inspired by the Parent's story and being proud of them for making changes, and willing to help out if needed.\n3. Both the parent and child express love and support for each other, with the parent now focused on taking care of themselves and enjoying their independence, wanting to provide a safe and stable environment for the child.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I agree, feeling understood and heard can mean a lot, especially in difficult moments.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful context for understanding the relationship dynamics between the Parent and the Child based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY reveals that the Parent has gone through difficult situations, reflected upon past mistakes, and is focused on self-improvement and maintaining their independence. The Child is portrayed as supportive and proud of the Parent's positive changes. This context is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT since it hints at the importance of listening and providing support during tough times, as discussed in the conversation. However, the sentences in the MEMORY could be more directly connected to the specific content of the dialogue. The focus on listening in the dialogue context is not explicitly mentioned in the MEMORY, which could strengthen the connection. Without this explicit connection, it earns a midrange score rather than a higher one."
