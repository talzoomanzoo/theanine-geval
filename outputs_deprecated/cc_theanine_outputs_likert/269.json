Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Wife, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today.\nWife: That's lovely! I always feel so cozy and comfortable when you do that.\nHusband: I know, and I love making the apartment feel like a warm and welcoming space for you.\nWife: You always go above and beyond, dear.\nHusband: It's the little things that count, right?\nWife: Definitely. Speaking of little things, do you remember when you told me about catching the bus just in time a few months ago?\nHusband: Oh yes, I remember. I was so relieved I didn't have to wait in the cold for the next one.\nWife: It's amazing how small moments like that can make such a big difference in our day, isn't it?\nHusband: Absolutely. It's the small moments that make life worth living.\n\nMEMORY:\nThe husband feels supported by his wife in pursuing activities that make him happy outside of work and family life. This makes the husband value spending time with his friend, feeling happy and content with their company. Similarly, the husband values the supportive community of believers at church and appreciates having his wife by his side, which makes the wife glad to see the husband finding a sense of purpose and being happy.\n\nThe husband values having someone trustworthy to spend time with and looks forward to working on the podcast project. Both the husband and wife agree that it's the little things that add up and make life meaningful. Additionally, the husband appreciates the little things in life, such as making it to the bus on time, which reminds the wife of the time the husband had to run to catch the bus a couple of years ago.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm grateful for all those small moments we share together, they truly make a difference in our lives.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY contains relevant and helpful information for generating a next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes several key elements that align with the themes and references in the conversation: the husband's appreciation for small, meaningful moments, such as catching the bus on time, which is directly mentioned in the dialogue. The MEMORY also encapsulates the couple's shared values, like the importance of little things in life and the husband's feelings of support from his wife, which contributes to a warm and understanding marital dynamic. The references to the husband's activities outside of family life, while not directly discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, are naturally structured. This allows the language model to easily identify relevant cues and differentiate between useful and less critical memory elements. However, the beginning part of the MEMORY about the husband's activities and friendships is less tied to the current dialogue topic, which slightly reduces its overall score."
