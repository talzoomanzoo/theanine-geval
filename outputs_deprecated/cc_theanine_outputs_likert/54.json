    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today?\nCo-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing.\nCo-workers A: Do you need any help? I don't want you to get overwhelmed.\nCo-workers B: That's really nice of you, but I don't want to burden you with my work.\nCo-workers A: It's not a burden if it's something I can do to support you. Plus, helping you out makes me feel good too.\nCo-workers B: You're right, thank you. You always go above and beyond to help me out.\nCo-workers A: That's what co-workers are for. We're a team and we need to support each other.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B supports Co-worker A in prioritizing their health and is pleased that Co-worker A is doing well. Co-worker B is grateful for the horse given by Co-worker A, expressing joy and happiness.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provided does not seem directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context focuses on a conversation regarding workload, support, and teamwork between Co-worker A and Co-worker B. However, the MEMORY talks about Co-worker B's support for Co-worker A's health and gratitude for a horse, which seems unrelated to the current dialogue. The sentences in the MEMORY lack a connection to the current interaction, and they do not provide useful cues or information needed to generate a coherent continuation of the dialogue. Hence, MEMORY does not effectively support the task at hand."
