Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Husband, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today.\nWife: That's lovely! I always feel so cozy and comfortable when you do that.\nHusband: I know, and I love making the apartment feel like a warm and welcoming space for you.\nWife: You always go above and beyond, dear.\nHusband: It's the little things that count, right?\nWife: Definitely. Speaking of little things, do you remember when you told me about catching the bus just in time a few months ago?\nHusband: Oh yes, I remember. I was so relieved I didn't have to wait in the cold for the next one.\nWife: It's amazing how small moments like that can make such a big difference in our day, isn't it?\nHusband: Absolutely. It's the small moments that make life worth living.\nWife: And speaking of living, you mentioned a while back how involved you are in the different ministries at church.\n\nMEMORY:\nThe husband enjoys spending quality time with his friend and cherishes their bond, feeling uplifted and at ease in their presence. He also treasures the supportive community of believers at church and is actively engaged in various ministries, finding strength in his faith. \nBoth the husband and wife prioritize the small, meaningful moments in life that contribute to their overall happiness and well-being. \nThe husband values reliability in his relationships and eagerly anticipates collaborating on a podcast project. Additionally, he finds joy in the simple pleasures of life, like making it to the bus on time.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, being part of the church community has been truly fulfilling. I find so much joy in giving back and connecting with others through our shared faith.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides highly relevant and naturally structured information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It includes details about the husband's involvement in church ministries which connects directly with the wife's reminder of his previous mention of it. Furthermore, the MEMORY notes the couple's appreciation for small, meaningful moments, paralleling their conversation about the importance of small moments like catching the bus on time. Overall, the MEMORY aids in providing context and connection to the ongoing dialogue, and any additional information not immediately relevant to the current conversation is structured naturally, allowing it to be easily identified as supplementary."
