Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message.\nCo-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of skills, you always present a compelling argument in debates. I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive.\nCo-workers A: Yes, I think it's important to back up your claims with facts and figures. It helps to convince the judge or the audience that you're right.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument. This aligns with Co-worker A's past experience of presenting evidence in front of a judge to support their position. Co-worker A denies that their reputation had any impact on Karen giving them the money.\n\nCo-worker A plans to present the evidence clearly and persuasively in court, which reflects their past behavior of presenting evidence in front of a judge to support their position. Co-worker A denies that their reputation had any impact on Karen giving them the money.\n\nCo-worker A has been collecting evidence for a case and is confident in the strength of their argument. This prompts Co-worker B to commend Co-worker A for having the courage to stand up and defend their beliefs. Additionally, Co-worker B is happy with the house built by Co-worker A and is considering adding a deck to the house.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "My Training Data: The current version of me is based on data until October 2023.\n\nHelpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memory that Co-worker A has experience presenting evidence in front of a judge does align with the dialogue context where Co-worker A discusses backing up claims with facts and figures to convince an audience. This provides some context about Co-worker A's background and skills which are being discussed in the dialogue. However, the memory information is somewhat repetitive and does not add new dimensions to the dialogue context. The parts mentioning Co-worker A's reputation and Karen giving them money are not relevant and do not enhance understanding of the current conversation. Additionally, the mention of Co-worker B being happy with a house built by Co-worker A and considering adding a deck is unrelated to the context of public speaking and debate skills, which are the main themes of DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Although the memory has some connection to the context, its helpfulness is limited by repetition and unrelated details, hence the score of 3."
