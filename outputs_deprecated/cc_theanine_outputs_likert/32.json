Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit.\nNeighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water.\nNeighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it.\nNeighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again.\nNeighbors A: I won't. So, do you remember the time when I mowed the lawn with that old push mower?\nNeighbors B: Yeah, I remember that. That was pretty tough work.\nNeighbors A: It was. But it was also a good workout.\nNeighbors B: I prefer to work out indoors where there's air conditioning.\nNeighbors A: Ha, I remember when I took off my jacket and put my feet up in your armchair. It was so warm that day.\nNeighbors B: Yeah, that was a hot day. I'm glad you felt comfortable in my home though.\nNeighbors A: You know, I really enjoy spending time with you. I want to get to know you even better.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A and B, who have known each other for years, enjoy spending time together and want to get to know each other even better. They reminisce about past events and plan to hang out once a week, possibly watching a movie, getting coffee, or just talking. Both neighbors enjoy spending time outside and doing chores like mowing the lawn. Additionally, Neighbor A particularly enjoys spending time in Neighbor B's cozy home and wants to hang out more often.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY is highly relevant and helpful to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures the main elements of their relationship, including their enjoyment of spending time together and reminiscing about past events as seen in the dialogue. The MEMORY also links the context where they talk about mowing the lawn and Neighbor A feeling comfortable in Neighbor B's home. Sentences are well-structured and naturally connected, making it easy for the language model to identify important contextual cues, and the memory adds depth to their relationship, thus supporting the generation of a convincing next response."
