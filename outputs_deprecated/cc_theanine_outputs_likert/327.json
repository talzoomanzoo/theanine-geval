Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today?\nCo-workers B: No, you didn't. What did you do there?\nCo-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done.\nCo-workers B: That's good. I hate going to the post office. It's always so crowded.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it was pretty busy today. But I needed to get this package sent out.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of packages, remember that time when you got stranded because you couldn't drive yourself home from a night out with friends?\nCo-workers A: Ugh, don't remind me. That was such a disaster.\nCo-workers B: It was definitely not one of your finest moments. But it's good to see that you're being responsible now and taking care of things like sending packages.\nCo-workers A: Thanks. I'm trying to be more responsible and reliable these days.\nCo-workers B: That's great to hear. It reminds me of the time when you were a great leader in your country. You were strong, determined, and made a positive impact.\nCo-workers A: Wow, that was a long time ago. But I appreciate the compliment. It's nice to be reminded of my successes.\nCo-workers B: Yeah, and even though you had some rough times in your personal life, like that painful breakup, you still managed to pick yourself up and move forward.\nCo-workers A: It wasn't easy, but I had to. And now I try to focus on the positive things in life, like sending packages without any issues.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B expresses concern about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits, but is now supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to be more responsible and reliable. This change in attitude is similar to how Co-worker A enjoys the extra space in their new place and values the privacy it provides between living and sleeping areas.\n\nCo-worker B's advice for Co-worker A to be disciplined and plan ahead is reminiscent of Co-worker A's past leadership role in their country, where they contributed to its prosperity and safety. This supportive and caring dynamic between both co-workers highlights the positive impact of their relationship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's a good mindset to have. It's all about moving forward and focusing on the positive.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Co-worker B's concern about Co-worker A's habits and their subsequent support for Co-worker A's efforts to be more responsible, which is relevant to their discussion in the dialogue about being responsible and sending packages. It also mentions Co-worker A's past leadership role, which is directly referenced in the dialogue. However, the mention of Co-worker A enjoying extra space and valuing privacy does not seem directly relevant to the current context discussed in the dialogue. While the memory captures the supportive and caring dynamic between the co-workers, it could be better structured or contain more specific cues directly tied to the dialogue context to achieve a higher score."
