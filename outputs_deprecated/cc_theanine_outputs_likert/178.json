Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Child, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: Child, I have a new project that I've been working on.\nChild: What is it, Parent?\nParent: I created a website where I post advertisements, and people can pay to see them.\nChild: Oh, that's interesting. How does it work?\nParent: Well, I create the ads myself, and then I post them on my website. People who want to view the ads can pay a small fee, and then they can see them.\nChild: Do you think people will pay to see your ads?\nParent: I don't know yet, but I hope so. I've put a lot of effort into creating some eye-catching ads.\nChild: That sounds cool, but why do you want to make money from ads?\nParent: Well, I want to have some extra income coming in. Plus, I enjoy being creative and making things, so this is a great way for me to combine those passions.\n\nMEMORY:\nThe Parent acknowledges being lazy about washing dishes and promises to contribute more to keeping the home clean. This leads to the Parent agreeing to make an effort to start pulling their weight around the house and follow the chore schedule. As a result, the parent and child have open communication about various topics, including a past accident and the parent's willingness to contribute more to household chores.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nThe MEMORY provides information about the Parent's previous discussion with the Child, particularly related to household chores and a past accident. However, this is irrelevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which revolves around the Parent's new project involving advertisement and their creative aspirations. There is no logical or direct connection between the topic of household chores and the discussion concerning the advertisement project, which diminishes the helpfulness of the MEMORY for generating a next response in the given context. Additionally, the representation of open communication mentioned in the MEMORY does not relate to the specific subject matter of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Thus, the MEMORY lacks pertinent information that would assist the language model in forming a relevant response to the ongoing dialogue."
