Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Why is your face so red and splotchy, Classmates B? Did you get sunburned?\nClassmates B: No, I didn't get sunburned. I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed.\nClassmates A: Embarrassed? Why?\nClassmates B: It's nothing, really. Just something embarrassing happened to me earlier.\nClassmates A: Come on, tell me! I won't judge you, I promise.\nClassmates B: Well, I accidentally spilled my lunch all over myself in front of some people.\nClassmates A: (laughs) That's it? That's why you're embarrassed? I thought it was something serious.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. After successfully landing on the moon but running out of oxygen, Classmate A showed determination in fixing their spaceship after it was damaged in a meteor shower. This led to Classmates B praising Classmate A for their resilience and quick thinking during a scary experience in space.\n   \n2. Classmates A expresses gratitude for Classmates B's support during the difficult situation, leading Classmate A to feel that pushing themselves to do better helps them improve their skills and learn something new. Both classmates value supporting and uplifting each other in their learning and growth, with Classmates A helping Classmates B out of friendship and believing in supporting each other.\n\n3. Classmates A expresses gratitude for Classmates B's support during the difficult situation, which prompts Classmate B to acknowledge Classmate A's success in their career due to their determination and refusal to settle for mediocrity.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I know, it's silly, but it caught me off guard. I guess we all have those moments, right?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does not contain relevant information that helps generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context revolves around a lighthearted situation where Classmates B is embarrassed about spilling their lunch, while the MEMORY primarily discusses unrelated events about space adventures, gratitude, and career success. There is no clear connection, causality, or development of events related to the context of embarrassment over a lunch mishap, making the MEMORY less useful for generating a relevant and fitting next response. The details in MEMORY do not provide contextual cues that align with the ongoing dialogue between the classmates."
