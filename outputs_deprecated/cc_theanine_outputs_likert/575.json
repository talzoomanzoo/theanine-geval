Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination.\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off.\nNeighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks?\nNeighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else.\nNeighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location?\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home.\nNeighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor B's reminder of Neighbor A's potential to do good things referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them makes Neighbor A consider using their skills for good instead of evil.\nNeighbor A's enjoyment in building houses and finishing them quickly caused them to find building the new house challenging but rewarding with the help of friends.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some information about Neighbor A's building skills and experiences, which could suggest that Neighbor A has the ability to finish tasks efficiently under certain circumstances. However, the MEMORY is not directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about procrastination and focuses instead on building a house. There is a lack of clear connection or causality between the MEMORY content and the discussion about working strategies to overcome procrastination issues. The potential helpfulness is minimal, as the current conversation involves methods to increase productivity, and the MEMORY's focus is more on past building experiences rather than strategies applicable in the current situation. Additionally, the memories are not naturally phrased in a way that clearly helps generate a suitable next response within the dialogue context provided."
