Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey, can you keep a secret?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A enjoys cooking and made roasted vegetables and quinoa for dinner. Neighbors B is interested in Neighbors A's cooking and asks about the vegetables and quinoa preparation. Neighbors A and B joke about the fun aspects of using telekinesis to surprise people. Neighbors A is overwhelmed but also excited about their new ability. Neighbors B is excited and supportive of Neighbors A's new ability. Neighbor A is considering looking for a new job but is unsure of what they want to do. Neighbor A is feeling unfulfilled with their job and wants to make a bigger impact. Neighbor A is thinking about exploring new skills or hobbies outside of work, such as taking online courses or learning a new language.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Of course! What's the secret?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides a moderate amount of useful information for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It indicates that Neighbors A and B have a friendly relationship, with shared interests in cooking and joking about telekinesis, suggesting an atmosphere of trust and camaraderie, which aligns with Neighbors A's request to keep a secret. Additionally, the MEMORY touches on some deeper aspects of Neighbors A's life, such as feeling overwhelmed but excited, career considerations, and personal development pursuits, which hint at potential topics that could weave into their conversation. However, the connections between these elements are not very strongly demonstrated, leaving room for Neighbors B's response to be not as tightly guided to the specific context of \"keeping a secret.\" The MEMORY would benefit from more explicitly connecting these past interactions and ongoing feelings to support Neighbors B in generating a more contextually linked and supportive response."
