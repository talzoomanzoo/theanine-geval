Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I need to talk to you about something important.\nClassmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\nClassmates A: I know about your affair with that other woman.\nClassmates B: What are you talking about? I don't have an affair with anyone.\nClassmates A: Don't lie to me! I saw you together at the restaurant last week.\nClassmates B: That was just a business meeting. We were discussing a potential collaboration on a music project.\nClassmates A: I don't believe you. You're just trying to cover it up. I'm going to tell everyone and ruin your career.\nClassmates B: Why are you doing this? I thought we were friends.\nClassmates A: I can't stand that you're a better singer than I am. I'm envious of your talent and success.\nClassmates B: That's not a reason to try and destroy my life. If you're feeling insecure about your own abilities, that's something you need to work on. Don't take it out on other people.\nClassmates A: I know, I know. I'm sorry,. I was wrong to even think about doing something like that. Can you forgive me?\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates A has developed a crush on Classmates B, which Classmates B finds flattering. Classmates B is considering taking biology classes in college to learn more about how the body works. Classmate A is balancing high school and college classes to be successful and help their family.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provided contains some general information about Classmates A and B's past interactions, but it lacks specificity and relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY mentions Classmates A's crush on Classmates B, but it does not relate to the current situation where Classmates A is confronting Classmates B about an alleged affair. The details about Classmates B considering biology classes and Classmates A balancing school commitments are irrelevant to understanding the dynamic in the provided dialogue. The MEMORY does not aid in generating a proper response in this conversational context, as it misses key relational and situational cues present in the dialogue. While the sentences are well-structured, they do not provide the causality, connection, or development directly applicable to the dialogue."
