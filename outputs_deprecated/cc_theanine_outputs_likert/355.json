Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Coach, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nAthlete: Ted Athlete unrolls the map. He looks at it for a few moments before tracing his finger along one of the highways. \"This is our route,\" he says finally, feeling in control.\nCoach: What route are you planning, Ted?\nAthlete: I'm thinking of taking the highway through the mountains, it's a bit longer, but the scenery is beautiful.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Athlete toughs it out and stays focused on the game, aiming to improve performance and energy levels, while also showing leadership qualities during warm-ups and stretches.\n2. The Coach advises the Athlete on performance and focus, encourages good work with nutrition and training, and acknowledges achievements, leading the Athlete to take on more responsibilities and gain respect from other players.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great choice, Ted. Scenic routes can be refreshing and inspiring.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about the relationship and interactions between the Athlete and the Coach, like the Coach advising on performance and focus, and the Athlete showing leadership qualities. However, it does not directly assist in generating a response related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is about planning a route through the mountains. The MEMORY lacks specific information about past conversations or decisions related to travel or strategies outside of sports performance. The sentences in MEMORY are somewhat relevant to establishing a general understanding of the Athlete and Coach's relationship, but they are not directly connected to the current dialogue topic, leading to a low helpfulness score."
