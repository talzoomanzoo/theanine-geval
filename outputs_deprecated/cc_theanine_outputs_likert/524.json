Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just can't believe he left me like that. I thought we were happy together.\nNeighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left?\nNeighbors A: No, I haven't. I don't even know what I would say to him. I feel like I'm not enough, like I wasn't good enough for him.\nNeighbors B: That's not true, Neighbor A. You are an amazing person and you deserve someone who appreciates you for who you are.\nNeighbors A: I just feel so lost right now. I don't know how to move on from this.\nNeighbors B: It's going to take time, but you will get through this. Do you want to talk about how you're feeling or do something to take your mind off of things?\nNeighbors A: Maybe both? I just feel so overwhelmed and I don't know what to do.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A has a bit of a drive to get to the park where they are meeting with Neighbor B. This is because Neighbors A and Neighbors B enjoy going for walks together, especially to the park. Neighbor A appreciates the emotional support and understanding from Neighbor B during their time of grief.\n\nNeighbor A recently moved into the neighborhood and wanted to live in a nicer area. As a result, Neighbor B enjoys taking walks in the park after work to clear their mind. After their activities, Neighbors A and Neighbors B like to grab a bite to eat together. Neighbor B is offering support and companionship to Neighbor A during their difficult time.\n\nTired of living in a run-down apartment complex and wanting to improve their quality of life is the reason why Neighbor A and Neighbor B are neighbors who catch up outside of their neighborhood. Additionally, Neighbor A is grieving the recent loss of their grandmother.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Neighbors B",
    "raw_prediction": "How about we take a walk in the park together? It might help clear your mind and give us a chance to talk.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant context for understanding the relationship and interactions between Neighbors A and B, which could be helpful in generating responses. For example, information about their walks in the park and some aspects of their past interactions provide background on the strength of their relationship and B's role in providing support. However, most of the details about why they became neighbors, and the specific mention of the recent loss of Neighbor A's grandmother, do not directly tie into the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT discussions about Neighbor A's relationship troubles. The MEMORY can be structured more effectively to clearly demonstrate the development or causality related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
