Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel really fulfilled as a leader and guide. Helping others gives me a sense of purpose.\nCo-workers B: I can see that. You always seem to know just what to do to make people feel better.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I've had a lot of practice over the years. It's just something that comes naturally to me.\nCo-workers B: Do you remember that time when you were led to a safe place by the commander? You must have felt pretty grateful for his guidance then.\nCo-workers A: Absolutely. It was a really tough time and I was so relieved to have someone show me the way. I try to pay it forward by being that kind of leader for others.\nCo-workers B: That's a great attitude to have. Speaking of leadership, do you think you would ever want to take on a higher position in the company?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. [Co-worker B emphasizes the importance of acknowledging privileges and using them to make the world a better place.] - (React) - [Co-worker A had a positive experience with a commander who helped them feel safe.]\n2. [Co-worker B values finding fulfillment in work, pursuing hobbies, making a difference in the world, and building relationships with others.] - (Want) - [Co-worker A wants to ensure the best production for the audience and hopes to find a compromise with the director.]\n3. [Co-worker A believes that making money can lead to fulfillment and provide the freedom to pursue hobbies and interests.] - (Want) - [Co-worker A values making money and is interested in opportunities to do so.]\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've thought about it, but right now I'm really focused on making a difference in my current role.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information that provides context for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The first memory mentions a positive experience Co-worker A had with a commander, which is directly related to the conversation in the dialogue context about leadership and guidance. This connection helps Co-worker A's perspective make sense in the ongoing conversation. However, the second and third memories do not provide as much direct relevance to the specific topics raised in the dialogue context. They provide general insights into Co-worker A's priorities and values, such as finding fulfillment and making money, but do not directly support the conversation's focus on leadership roles and experiences. Nevertheless, they are naturally phrased and offer some useful contextual cues that align with Co-worker A's character. Therefore, it merits a mid-range score of 3."
