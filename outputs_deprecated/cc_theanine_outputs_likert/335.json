    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, how's it going?\nNeighbors B: Not bad, thanks. How about you?\nNeighbors A: Oh, I'm doing alright. I was just thinking about the old days when I had my rock band.\nNeighbors B: Really? You had a band?\nNeighbors A: Yeah, we were called \"The Neighbors A Band.\" We used to play live shows around the city.\nNeighbors B: That's awesome! What kind of music did you guys play?\nNeighbors A: We played rock music, mostly covers but we also wrote some of our own songs.\nNeighbors B: Have you ever thought about starting the band again?\n\nMEMORY:\n- Neighbor A offered to provide the name of their chiropractor to Neighbor B if they decide to go. Neighbor A and Neighbor B enjoy playing together with toys. Neighbor B is familiar with Neighbor A's dog and looking forward to playing with it again. Neighbor A appreciated the support and friendship of Neighbor B.\n- Neighbor B is interested in chiropractic care after hearing about Neighbor A's positive experience. Neighbor A looks forward to playing with Neighbor B again when feeling better. Neighbor A recently moved to London from their current location. Neighbor A moved to London in the past and had to learn how to manage stress.\n- Neighbor A offered to provide the name of their chiropractor to Neighbor B if they decide to go. Neighbor A and Neighbor B enjoy playing together with toys. Neighbor A appreciated the support and friendship of Neighbor B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information related to events outside of the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as discussions about chiropractors, moving to London, and playing with toys. Most of these events and interactions do not provide helpful context or relevant background for understanding the current dialogue about Neighbor A's past rock band and potentially restarting it. The sentences in MEMORY, while naturally phrased, lack connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about music. Only vague references to friendship and interaction are hinted at, which might slightly aid in understanding the dynamics between the neighbors but do not significantly contribute to a meaningful next dialogue about Neighbor A's rock band."
