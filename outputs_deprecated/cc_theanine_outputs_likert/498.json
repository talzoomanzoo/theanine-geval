Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hi there, I was wondering if you'd like to join me for lunch on Tuesday at the school cafeteria.\nCo-workers B: Oh, sure. Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking?\nCo-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you?\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B complimented Co-worker A's writing skills and reliability as a journalist. They are supportive and encouraging towards Co-worker A. \nCo-worker A is trying to be more conscious of how their actions impact others and avoid causing problems for anyone else. In response, Co-worker B reassures Co-worker A that making mistakes is okay as long as they learn from them, and encourages them to have more confidence. Co-worker B also mentioned that Co-worker A is responsible in their work, even if not always in other aspects of life, and reminds them of their progress and potential for success.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some useful information about the dynamics between Co-workers A and B, indicating that B values A's writing skills and reliability, and that B is generally supportive. This background could be helpful in understanding the tone and mutual respect in their ongoing interactions. However, most of the details do not directly relate to the immediate context of arranging a lunch meeting, which is the focus of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe MEMORY does not offer specific information about past scheduling preferences or previous meetings that would directly assist in crafting a response to the current situation. However, the positive, supportive background may subtly inform the tone and choice of words in B's response, but does not provide direct, actionable information regarding the arrangement of the lunch.\n\nOverall, while there is some relevant context about the relationship and communication style, the MEMORY is not specifically aligned with or directly helpful for generating the next dialogue response in this particular scenario."
