Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A has been trying to improve their punctuality and cut back on drinking, and as a result, they have been successful in not being late to work for weeks.\n   \n2. Co-worker A has been getting written up for being late to work, which made them react by being successful in not being late to work for weeks.\n   \n3. Co-worker B is concerned about Co-worker A's punctuality and drinking habits, and in reaction, Co-worker B is supportive of Co-worker A's efforts to improve their life by being more responsible and reliable. This led to Co-worker B being supportive and encouraging Co-worker A to give people a chance.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation:\nThe MEMORY provides some background context related to Co-worker A's efforts to improve punctuality and reduce drinking habits. Although this information gives a sense of Co-worker A's character and recent behavior changes, it lacks direct relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is about Co-worker A visiting the post office. The MEMORY offers insight into Co-worker B's supportive role, but again, this does not directly connect to the current conversation. The past interactions between Co-worker A and Co-worker B described in the MEMORY do not provide significant cues or information helpful for generating a response about the post office. Additionally, the sentences are not structured to clearly demonstrate relevance or causality related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, thus limiting their helpfulness."
