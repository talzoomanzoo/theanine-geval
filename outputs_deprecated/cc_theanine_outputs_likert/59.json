Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I need to talk to you about something important.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Both Classmates A and B enjoy talking to each other and consider themselves great study partners. Classmates A expresses admiration for Classmates B's intelligence and sense of humor. They are excited about seeing Lady Gaga in concert and are looking forward to singing and dancing along to her hits.\n\n2. Classmates A suggests grabbing lunch together, showing an interest in spending more time with Classmates B. Both Classmates A and B enjoy talking to each other and consider themselves great study partners. Classmate B admires Classmate A's dedication and believes they have a knack for science. They discuss Classmate A's favorite Lady Gaga song, \"Born This Way.\"\n\n3. Both Classmates A and B have a good relationship, with Classmates A expressing admiration for Classmates B's intelligence and sense of humor. They are interested in biology and studying cells. Classmate A is passionate about science and interested in becoming a doctor or researcher to help people and make a difference.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Sure, what's on your mind?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information that reflects the dynamic between Classmates A and B. It indicates that they have a good relationship, share common interests, and enjoy each other's company, which could support generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY lacks specificity regarding the \"something important\" that Classmates A wants to talk about. The memories are more focused on their social connections and shared interests rather than directly offering insight into the current interaction needed for a next response. While the memories are well-structured, they do not specifically relate to the given context, thus offering limited helpfulness in generating a relevant and appropriate response."
