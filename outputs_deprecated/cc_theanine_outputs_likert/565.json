Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, how are you feeling today?\nClassmates B: I'm feeling frustrated. I wish I could do things on my own.\nClassmates A: I understand how you feel. It can be tough when you feel like you're dependent on others.\nClassmates B: Yeah, exactly. I don't want to be a burden on anyone.\nClassmates A: You're not a burden, don't worry. And I'm always here to help you out.\nClassmates B: I appreciate that, but I don't want to always rely on others. I want to be more independent.\nClassmates A: I get it. Maybe there are some small things you can do on your own to start feeling more independent?\nClassmates B: Like what?\nClassmates A: Well, maybe you can start by making a list of things you'd like to do on your own and we can work on achieving those goals together.\nClassmates B: That sounds like a good idea. Thanks for understanding, Classmates A.\nClassmates A: Of course, I'm always here to support you. Hey, speaking of goals, remember when we talked about your guitar playing a few months ago? How's that going?\nClassmates B: It's going really well, thanks for asking! I've been practicing every day and I feel like I'm getting better.\nClassmates A: That's awesome! Have you thought about joining a band or playing gigs around town?\nClassmates B: Not really, I'm still a bit nervous about performing in front of people.\nClassmates A: I get it, performing can be scary. But maybe in a few months, we can work on setting a goal for you to do a small performance somewhere.\nClassmates B: That sounds like a challenge, but also kind of exciting. I'm in!\nClassmates A: Great, I'm looking forward to seeing you rock out on stage. Hey, remember when we talked about your new car a few hours ago? How's that going?\nClassmates B: I'm loving it! It's so much fun to drive. Thanks for asking, Classmates A.\nClassmates A: No problem, glad to hear it. Hey, I remember a few months ago when you talked about being reminded of your childhood and feeling emotional. How are you feeling about that now?\nClassmates B: I'm still feeling a bit emotional about it, but I've also been trying to focus on making new positive memories to replace the old ones.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B share a friendly and supportive relationship, discussing their experiences and keeping up with homework in their math class.\n\n2. Classmates A and B bond over music, with A playing guitar, taking lessons, and participating in a band. They enjoy jamming together and plan to collaborate on music in the future. They also reminisce about childhood memories, like playing on swings and making music with friends.\n\n3. Classmates B admires Classmates A's pursuit of their musical passion after a conversation about following dreams. Additionally, B finds driving their recently bought red sports car to be fun and freeing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's great that you're focusing on creating new positive memories. It's important to cherish those moments too. If you ever want to talk more about it, I'm here to listen.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant and structured information that complements the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\n1. It confirms the supportive nature of Classmates A and B's relationship, which is central to their current conversation about supporting and understanding each other's feelings.\n2. The mention of music, specifically guitar playing, aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where they discuss Classmates B's practice and potential future performances. \n3. Classmates A playing guitar and participating in a band is somewhat aligned with the context, though it's not directly about Classmates B's progress.\n4. The MEMORY references driving a recently bought car, which ties in with the dialog about Classmates B's new car driving experience. \n5. The reminiscence about childhood memories is somewhat related, as the context mentions Classmates B feeling emotional about childhood memories. \n\nOverall, the MEMORY provides helpful cues that align with the context, enabling the language model to engage appropriately. However, it could be more precise in reflecting Classmates B's perspective and developments discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
