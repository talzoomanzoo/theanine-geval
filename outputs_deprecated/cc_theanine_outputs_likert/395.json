Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Husband, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway?\nWife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go?\nHusband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city.\nWife: Oh, that sounds like a perfect idea! It will be nice to have some peace and quiet for a change.\nHusband: Yes, and we could cook our meals together, go for a hike, and just relax. What do you think?\nWife: That sounds lovely, husband. I'm really looking forward to it.\nHusband: Great. I'll start looking for rental cabins right away. I know this may sound impulsive, but I'm really excited to make this happen.\nWife: Don't worry, husband, it's not impulsive. You always follow through with your plans, and I believe this will be a wonderful experience for both of us.\nHusband: Thank you, wife. And, I want to apologize for the time I left without waiting for you. I know I promised to wait, and I should have kept my word.\nWife: It's okay, husband. I understand that you were in a hurry, and it wasn't intentional. Besides, that was a long time ago, and we've moved past it.\nHusband: Thank you for being so understanding, wife. I just want to make sure I am not repeating the same mistake again.\nWife: I trust that you won't, husband. And hey, remember when I stopped a runaway carriage from causing harm to a group of people? That was quite the adrenaline rush!\nHusband: Oh, I remember that, wife. You are fearless, and I'm so proud of you.\nWife: Thanks, husband. And speaking of good times, I had so much fun at the dance a few weeks ago. Dancing with you always puts me in a good mood.\n\nMEMORY:\nThe husband is inspired by his wife to take action on his dreams and goals. This drives him to achieve his dreams and put effort into making them a reality.\nThe wife reassures the husband of her continuous support and belief in him. This leads to the husband acknowledging his mistake, apologizing, and promising to make it up to his wife. He emphasizes the importance of keeping promises and taking action.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides a relevant summary of some key points in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the husband's drive being inspired by the wife, the wife's reassurance and support, and the husband's apology and promise to keep his word in the future. However, it lacks specific details, connections, and development of past interactions that could provide more context and relevance to the dialogue about going on a weekend getaway. While it aids in understanding the underlying emotions and intentions in the conversation, it does not adequately capture the situational details or moments from their past that are recounted by the wife and husband within the context. Thus, while helpful, it could be more fleshed out and connected to the context."
