    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I really enjoy being a carpenter. It's a very fulfilling job.\nClassmates B: That's great to hear! How did you get into carpentry?\nClassmates A: My dad was a carpenter, so I grew up around it. I started by helping him out when I was young, and then I began to really enjoy it myself.\nClassmates B: That's awesome that you were able to learn from your dad and turn it into a career. Have you done any big projects lately?\n\nMEMORY:\n- Classmate A has a background in carpentry from helping their dad and now enjoys it as a career.\n- Classmate B acknowledges and supports Classmate A's journey into carpentry.\n- Classmate B hopes for improvements from the President for the country's betterment.\n- Classmate A is eager to learn business strategies and attends a seminar on starting a business.\n- Classmate A plans to apply the knowledge gained from the seminar to future business endeavors.\n- Classmate A is researching local opportunities like open mic nights to build a following for their talent.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I recently finished a custom-built bookshelf for a client, and they were thrilled with the result. It's always satisfying to see the impact of my work on someone's home.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information about Classmate A's background in carpentry, which directly relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This memory point helps to reinforce Classmate A's reasons for entering the field and their current career satisfaction, such as growing up around carpentry due to their father. However, the remaining points in MEMORY are less relevant to the ongoing dialogue. These include subjects like Classmate B's hopes for the President, Classmate A's seminar on business strategies, or their interest in open mic nights. These topics do not directly connect to the conversation about carpentry and the specific project discussion that might follow. The relevant memory sentence is helpful for the LLM, but the rest do not contribute to the current dialogue and should clearly indicate their lesser relevance. Thus, the structure of memory could be improved by focusing more on relevant past interactions to give a more fluid context for response generation."
