Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just tried this breathing exercise and it really helped me relax.\nNeighbors B: What kind of breathing exercise?\nNeighbors A: It's just a simple one, where you inhale for four seconds, hold your breath for seven seconds, and then exhale for eight seconds. I've been doing it every day for the past week and it's made such a difference.\nNeighbors B: That's really interesting. I've heard that breathing exercises can be really helpful for reducing stress and anxiety.\nNeighbors A: Yes, it definitely has helped me with that. Plus, it's something that I can easily do anywhere, whether I'm at home or out running errands.\nNeighbors B: That's great. It's always good to have a simple tool like that to help manage stress. \nNeighbors A: Speaking of managing stress, remember a few years ago when I pushed your shoulder because I wanted you to accept me?\nNeighbors B: Oh yeah, I do remember that. That was a stressful time for both of us.\nNeighbors A: It definitely was. But I'm so glad that we've been able to move past that and have a good neighborly relationship now.\nNeighbors B: Me too. And remember when you found that great park a few years ago?\nNeighbors A: Yes, I loved that park! It was such a fun place to hang out and play games.\nNeighbors B: It's always nice to find a good outdoor space like that. Have you been back recently?\nNeighbors A: Not in a little while, but maybe we should plan a visit soon. \n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A recently discovered a park on Main Street with a playground and water park area, which reminded Neighbor A and Neighbor B of the park they found together a couple of years ago and enjoyed playing frisbee and having a picnic. \nNeighbor A surprised Neighbor B with a pizza, showing Neighbor B the value of their friendship. In return, Neighbor B reassures Neighbor A about past embarrassing incidents and emphasizes their current friendship. \nNeighbor A surprised Neighbor B with a pizza, which made Neighbor B appreciate their friendship even more. As a result, Neighbor A reminisces about simpler times and expresses missing them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a great idea. It would be nice to revisit that park and enjoy some outdoor time together.",
    "prediction": "3\n\nThe MEMORY does contain some helpful information for generating a proper response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it could be better structured and more explicitly connected to the context at hand. The MEMORY touches on shared activities like discovering a park and sharing moments of friendship, which is in line with the dialogue topics about stress relief, past incidents, and a good neighborly relationship. These memories serve as a background and can help Neighbor B in the dialogue to affirm and strengthen the current positive neighborly relationship. The mention of past embarrassing incidents is relevant as it mirrors the feelings expressed in the context about moving past stressful times. However, the MEMORY lacks a coherent narrative structure and contains repetitive information concerning the pizza surprise. For an improved helpfulness score, the MEMORY would benefit from being more clearly aligned with the specific breathing exercise subject and a more distinct sequential or causal connection to the dialogue elements like stressing past conflict resolution and shared simple joys."
