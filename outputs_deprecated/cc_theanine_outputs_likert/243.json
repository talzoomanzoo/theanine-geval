Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A, described as having \"Sherlock Holmes-like skills\" and enjoying solving mysteries, did some research on social media to find out that Co-worker B is married. Co-worker B was surprised when Co-worker A found out they were married.\n2. Co-worker A suggests celebrating their detective work with drinks after work, as they are excited about payday and being able to pay off bills. Co-worker B, who is married, had a weekend where they went hiking and had dinner with friends. They also shared happy memories from their time working together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provided offers some background information about Co-worker A, particularly their interest in solving mysteries and excitement about paying off bills, which may suggest certain character traits like curiosity and financial priorities. However, this information does not directly aid in generating a response to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is about Co-worker A singing a solo at church. There is no clear causality or connection between the MEMORY and the immediate conversation. The existing memory points could potentially be relevant to different contexts involving Co-worker A's detective skills or financial matters but do not provide helpful cues for the current dialogue about singing a solo. The MEMORY is structured and phrased in a way that doesn't naturally feed into the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT, resulting in a lower score."
