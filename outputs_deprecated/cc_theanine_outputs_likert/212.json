Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just tried this breathing exercise and it really helped me relax.\nNeighbors B: What kind of breathing exercise?\nNeighbors A: It's just a simple one, where you inhale for four seconds, hold your breath for seven seconds, and then exhale for eight seconds. I've been doing it every day for the past week and it's made such a difference.\nNeighbors B: That's really interesting. I've heard that breathing exercises can be really helpful for reducing stress and anxiety.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A showed appreciation for Neighbors B's actions in the neighborhood, prompting them to take things slow in their relationship. In response, Neighbor B reassured Neighbor A about past embarrassing incidents and emphasized their current friendship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Neighbors A",
    "raw_prediction": "Yes, they definitely can. I find it so grounding and calming. Have you tried any other relaxation techniques before?",
    "prediction": "3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information about the relationship between Neighbors A and B, which may aid in understanding the context of their interactions. It indicates that there's mutual appreciation and friendship, possibly implying a supportive and understanding dynamic. However, the details in MEMORY are not directly relevant to the current topic in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is about breathing exercises and stress reduction. While the MEMORY enhances understanding of the relationship, it doesn't directly aid in generating a response related to the exercise. The phrasing is natural and coherent, making it moderately helpful, hence a score of 3."
