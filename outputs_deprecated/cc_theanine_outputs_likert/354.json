Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Athlete, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nAthlete: Ted Athlete unrolls the map. He looks at it for a few moments before tracing his finger along one of the highways. \"This is our route,\" he says finally, feeling in control.\nCoach: What route are you planning, Ted?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Coach is advising the Athlete on performance and focus, which leads the Athlete to focus on helping the team succeed and displaying leadership qualities during warm-ups and stretches.\n2. The Coach advises the Athlete on nutrition and training, prompting the Athlete to seek approval and praise from the Coach, resulting in taking on more responsibilities and gaining respect from other players.\n3. The Coach advises the Athlete on performance and focus, causing the Athlete to focus on improving performance and energy levels, which leads to taking on more responsibilities and gaining respect from other players.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information regarding the relationship dynamics between the Coach and the Athlete that could be helpful in generating a proper response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, the MEMORY contains details about how the Coach advises the Athlete and how this influences the Athlete's actions and behavior. This indicates a pattern of the Coach's guidance and its impact, which could be valuable for understanding the nuances of their interactions.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY doesn't provide any specific information directly related to the topic of the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which involves a route planning discussion involving a map. The MEMORY's focus is primarily on performance, focus, nutrition, and responsibilities, which are not directly connected to route planning or strategy.\n\nDespite this, the general information about the relationship and roles of guidance and leadership could still provide some context for generating appropriate dialogue, especially if these dynamics could influence decision-making in route planning scenarios. Nevertheless, the MEMORY lacks direct relevancy to the specific context of map reading and route planning.\n\nOverall, while the MEMORY provides a useful background on the Coach and Athlete relationship, it lacks the specific details needed to fully support the current dialogue context, balancing between being generally informative on past interactions but not directly applicable to the present situation."
