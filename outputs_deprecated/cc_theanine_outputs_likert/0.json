Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Child, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: You know, I always valued being a good listener. It's an important skill to have in life.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The parent, feeling supported and cared for by the child, now wants to provide a safe and stable environment for the child who values independence and self-sufficiency.\n2. Both the parent and child express love and support for each other, which caused the parent to find hope and appreciate small moments even in difficult situations, leading to the parent now living in a little house in the suburbs that they love.\n3. The child, being supportive and caring towards the parent, finds the parent's story inspiring, as the parent mentions making mistakes in the past and trying to turn their life around.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I agree, being a good listener can make a big difference in how we connect with others.",
    "prediction": "**Helpfulness Score: 3**\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe MEMORY provided contains some helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as it provides background on the relationship between the parent and child, suggesting that they express love and support for each other, which can help the language model generate a response that acknowledges this supportive dynamic. However, the MEMORY lacks direct connection and specific exploration of the \"good listener\" topic mentioned in the context. The sentences are somewhat naturally structured, but they don't entirely focus on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT's immediate theme, which is the importance of being a good listener. While the information about mutual care and support may aid in shaping responses with an empathetic tone, the MEMORY doesn't offer specific cues to address the current topic. Therefore, it provides moderate helpfulness, neither negligible nor exceptionally relevant to the present conversation."
