Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just tried this breathing exercise and it really helped me relax.\nNeighbors B: What kind of breathing exercise?\nNeighbors A: It's just a simple one, where you inhale for four seconds, hold your breath for seven seconds, and then exhale for eight seconds. I've been doing it every day for the past week and it's made such a difference.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A did a breathing exercise to relax, finding it helpful. - Neighbors B inquires about the breathing exercise. - Neighbors A explains a simple breathing exercise they do daily, which involves inhaling for four seconds, holding for seven seconds, and exhaling for eight seconds.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds interesting, I might give it a try too.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nThe MEMORY effectively summarizes the past interactions between Neighbors A and B as mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It succinctly outlines the key details: Neighbors A found the breathing exercise helpful for relaxation, Neighbors B's inquiry about it, and Neighbors A's explanation of the exercise routine. The MEMORY is clear, coherent, and provides essential information, helping a language model to generate a relevant response based on the given context. The sentences are naturally structured and demonstrate a clear development of the conversation, making it highly beneficial for generating a suitable next response."
