Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Wife, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today.\nWife: That's lovely! I always feel so cozy and comfortable when you do that.\nHusband: I know, and I love making the apartment feel like a warm and welcoming space for you.\nWife: You always go above and beyond, dear.\nHusband: It's the little things that count, right?\nWife: Definitely. Speaking of little things, do you remember when you told me about catching the bus just in time a few months ago?\nHusband: Oh yes, I remember. I was so relieved I didn't have to wait in the cold for the next one.\n\nMEMORY:\nThe husband appreciates the little things in life, such as making it to the bus on time. \nThe wife mentions that the husband had to run to catch the bus a couple of years ago.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that could be useful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It correctly identifies the husband's appreciation for the little things in life and mentions an event where he almost missed a bus, which aligns with the wife's reference to a similar past event. However, the MEMORY could be more helpful by providing additional context or details about similar instances or why these little things are significant to both speakers. The sentences in MEMORY do connect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but they are somewhat sparse on details and could be phrased better to fully capture the interaction's development and nuances. Overall, the MEMORY is partially helpful but could be improved for a higher score."
