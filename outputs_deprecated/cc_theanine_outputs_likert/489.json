Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I just finished my computer course, and I learned so much about using computers effectively.\nClassmates B: That's great! What did you learn specifically?\nClassmates A: Oh, a lot of things. I learned how to use different programs and software for different tasks, and how to choose the right one depending on what I need to do.\n\nMEMORY:\n- [Classmates A acknowledges the mistake and plans to learn from it.] - (React) - [Classmate B is a supportive friend who listens and offers to help.] - (HinderedBy) - [Classmates A and Classmates B are friends who help each other with schoolwork.] \n- [Classmates A acknowledges the mistake and plans to learn from it.] - (Changed) - [Classmates A has matured since then and learned from past mistakes.] \n- [Classmates B emphasizes the consequences of Classmates A's actions and the need for responsibility.] - (SameTopic) - [Classmates B and Classmates A used to dance a lot in middle school.]\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides a few insights into the relationship between Classmates A and Classmates B, suggesting they have a supportive friendship and have been involved in each other's learning experiences. However, it lacks direct relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is focused on Classmates A's experience with a computer course and the specific learning outcomes. The MEMORY primarily addresses aspects of mistakes, responsibility, and past activities like dancing that are not directly related to the current context of discussing computer courses. Additionally, the connections between sentences are not clearly established regarding causality or development in relation to the ongoing dialogue about computer learning. Therefore, while the MEMORY provides some information about the dynamics of the relationship, it is not particularly useful for generating a relevant next response in this context."
