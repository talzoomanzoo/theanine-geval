Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Coach, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nAthlete: Ted Athlete unrolls the map. He looks at it for a few moments before tracing his finger along one of the highways. \"This is our route,\" he says finally, feeling in control.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Athlete is focused on helping the team succeed and has shown leadership qualities during warm-ups and stretches, which leads to the Athlete deciding to tough it out and stay focused on the game.\n2. The Coach is giving advice to the Athlete regarding their performance and focus, causing the coach to encourage the athlete to continue their good work with nutrition and training, which results in the Coach encouraging the Athlete to keep up the good work and acknowledges their achievements, leading to the Athlete taking on more responsibilities and gaining respect from other players.\n3. The Athlete decides to tough it out and stay focused on the game, which changes to the Athlete being focused on improving their performance and energy levels, causing the Athlete to take on more responsibilities and gain respect from other players.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY appears to provide some level of continuity in the development of the athlete's focus, leadership, and interaction with the coach. However, the sentences seem disjointed and repetitive, making it difficult to derive a clear and cohesive understanding of the interactions or progression of events that would be helpful for generating a response to the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY lacks specificity and connection to the map reading situation described in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It generally portrays an overarching theme of leadership and focus but does not add specific, actionable detail that would support the specific scenario of tracing a route on the map. Therefore, while there's a vague connection, it doesn't offer significant or direct assistance for the immediate context or conversation continuity."
