Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination.\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off.\nNeighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks?\nNeighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else.\nNeighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location?\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home.\nNeighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become.\nNeighbors A: You're right, I need to stop making excuses and just get it done. Thanks for the advice.\nNeighbors B: No problem. Speaking of goals, how's the house project coming along? \nNeighbors A: It's finished! Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard. It was a lot of work, but worth it in the end. \nNeighbors B: That's amazing, thanks for building me such a beautiful house. \nNeighbors A: Of course, I'm glad you like it. Remember when we watched the sunset over the London skyline? That was such a beautiful moment.\nNeighbors B: Yes, I still remember the pink and orange hues reflecting off the buildings. It was breathtaking.\nNeighbors A: Speaking of London, have you heard about those recent cases of identity theft? It's terrible that people like that exist.\nNeighbors B: Yes, it's scary to think someone could steal your identity and ruin your life like that.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A's enjoyment of building houses and finishing them quickly led to Neighbor A helping Neighbor B build a new house with amazing features. This act caused Neighbor B to remind Neighbor A of their potential to do good things, referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them. Subsequently, Neighbor A expressed a desire to believe that plants need sunlight, water, and love to thrive.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically about Neighbor A helping Neighbor B build a new house, which aligns with the part of the dialogue where Neighbor A talks about finishing the house project. However, the MEMORY is not very well-structured or connected in terms of representing the development of two speakers' past interactions. The phrase \"building houses and finishing them quickly\" is not entirely relevant, as the DIALOGUE CONTEXT does not mention quick completion as a specific trait. Additionally, the MEMORY introduces irrelevant information about \"plants needing sunlight, water, and love,\" which does not connect to any part of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Therefore, while there is some helpful information, it is not clearly laid out, and other parts of the MEMORY are not beneficial, leading to a low score."
