    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A and Neighbor B have known each other for years, becoming good friends. They both agree to start this weekend and are looking forward to it. Neighbor B enjoys cooking and suggests making something together. Neighbor B suggests having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbor A mows the lawn, showing consideration for each other.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided offers a general background on the relationship between Neighbors A and B, indicating that they have known each other for years and are good friends. However, it fails to provide specific information or context that directly relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where they're discussing someone's recent action of pushing the other into cold water. There is a mention of shared activities like cooking or plans for the weekend, but this information is not directly relevant to understanding the context or dynamics of the current dialogue. While the MEMORY contains naturally structured sentences, they do not provide significant cues or details that would directly aid in formulating a response in the current situation, resulting in a low helpfulness score."
