Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination.\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off.\nNeighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks?\nNeighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else.\nNeighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location?\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home.\nNeighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become.\nNeighbors A: You're right, I need to stop making excuses and just get it done. Thanks for the advice.\nNeighbors B: No problem. Speaking of goals, how's the house project coming along? \nNeighbors A: It's finished! Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard. It was a lot of work, but worth it in the end. \nNeighbors B: That's amazing, thanks for building me such a beautiful house. \nNeighbors A: Of course, I'm glad you like it. Remember when we watched the sunset over the London skyline? That was such a beautiful moment.\nNeighbors B: Yes, I still remember the pink and orange hues reflecting off the buildings. It was breathtaking.\nNeighbors A: Speaking of London, have you heard about those recent cases of identity theft? It's terrible that people like that exist.\nNeighbors B: Yes, it's scary to think someone could steal your identity and ruin your life like that.\nNeighbors A: Exactly, that's why I always try to be a kind person and help others when I can. Like arranging flowers in a vase, for example. Small acts of kindness can make a big difference. \n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A decided to surprise Neighbor B with a special gesture of kindness and helped build a new house for them. This act sparked a conversation about doing good deeds and appreciating the beauty of their city. Additionally, Neighbor B's gratitude towards Neighbor A led to a discussion about organizing a community event to make a positive impact.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely, those small acts of kindness can really brighten someone's day. It's important to spread positivity in our community.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information regarding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly about Neighbors A building a house for Neighbors B and a subsequent discussion about good deeds and community events. However, it doesn't directly address the immediate context of the conversation which involves procrastination and advice on focusing on tasks. The MEMORY captures the essence of an act of kindness that ties into the latter part of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT with the house project, but it lacks connection to the earlier context about procrastination and problem-solving strategies. The sentences in the MEMORY are somewhat naturally structured, allowing a model to grasp the gist of past interactions, but they do not fully encompass the entirety or the variety of topics discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
