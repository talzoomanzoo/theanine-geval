Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel so grateful to have a boss who is always so supportive of me.\nCo-workers B: That's amazing to hear. Having a supportive boss can make all the difference in how you feel about your job.\nCo-workers A: Definitely. It makes me feel secure in my position and motivated to do my best work.\nCo-workers B: It's great to have that kind of positive reinforcement. Do you remember when we were working on that movie together and you were feeling really frustrated?\nCo-workers A: Oh yeah, I remember. I was so angry after blowing up that rabbit with the dynamite. But talking it out with you really helped me work through my emotions.\nCo-workers B: That's right. It's important to have someone to talk to when you're feeling overwhelmed or upset.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Co-worker A mentioned a past event involving blowing up a rabbit with dynamite, indicating a history of poor coping mechanisms for frustration, which led to Co-worker B expressing disapproval and suggesting talking to the director to address the stressful situation.\n- Co-worker A felt remorse for what they did and appreciated Co-worker B's understanding during their collaboration, leading to personal growth in empathy and compassion.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm just glad I have you as a supportive colleague to talk to when things get tough.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a useful summary of Co-worker A's past interaction involving a stressful event (blowing up a rabbit with dynamite) and how Co-worker B responded to it. This directly relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where they reference a past moment of frustration and how talking it out was helpful. The MEMORY correctly highlights Co-worker A's remorse and appreciation for Co-worker B's support, which aligns with the sense of gratitude and support shared in the dialogue. The sentences are naturally connected and demonstrate the development and impact of their past interactions, making this a helpful memory for generating a coherent and contextually relevant response in the current dialogue."
