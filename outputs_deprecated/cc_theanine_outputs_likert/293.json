Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Student, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn.\nTeacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation?\nStudent: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle.\nTeacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time?\nStudent: Really? Maybe I should try to build up my tolerance then.\nTeacher: It could be worth a try. Speaking of trying new things, how's your language studying going?\nStudent: It's going pretty well. I started with French, but now I'm considering taking up Spanish and German too. I want to become more well-rounded.\nTeacher: That's a great goal. Have you thought about any specific ways you could use your language skills?\nStudent: I would love to be able to travel more and speak with the locals in their native language. Maybe I could even teach my grandchildren some basic phrases.\nTeacher: Speaking of your grandchildren, how's your retirement planning going?\nStudent: It's going well. I'm really looking forward to spending more time with them and taking them on fun trips.\nTeacher: That sounds like a great plan. Speaking of fun, remember when you scared me in the hallway a few days ago?\n\nMEMORY:\nThe student had a heroic experience at the beach where they helped save a young kid from drowning. This event has made the student eager to retire and spend quality time with their grandchildren. Additionally, the student is currently studying French at college and intends to learn Spanish and German to become more well-rounded in language skills.\n\nThe teacher praised the student for their bravery and quick action in the emergency situation. This positive reinforcement may have contributed to the student feeling stressed lately, which could have led to the outburst. Furthermore, the student is excited about retiring and spending time with their grandkids, already planning fun activities.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, especially regarding the student's language learning goals and their excitement about retiring and spending time with their grandchildren. This aligns with the student's plans to learn Spanish and German, travel, and teach their grandchildren. However, the MEMORY introduces new elements, such as the heroic beach experience and the student's stress, which are not present in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and do not directly aid in generating a next response. These additional details might confuse the language model rather than help it focus on the current conversation topics. The memory is somewhat helpful but not entirely focused on the interactions present in the dialogue context."
