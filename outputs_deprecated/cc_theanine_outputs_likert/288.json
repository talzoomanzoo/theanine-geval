    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Teacher, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn.\nTeacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation?\nStudent: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle.\nTeacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time?\nStudent: Really? Maybe I should try to build up my tolerance then.\nTeacher: It could be worth a try. Speaking of trying new things, how's your language studying going?\nStudent: It's going pretty well. I started with French, but now I'm considering taking up Spanish and German too. I want to become more well-rounded.\n\nMEMORY:\nThe student had a heroic experience at the beach where they helped save a young kid from drowning. This reminds the student of looking forward to retirement and spending time with their grandchildren. The student is studying French at college and plans on learning Spanish and German as well.\n\nThe teacher speaks Spanish and French fluently. This connects to the teacher expressing understanding and encouraging the student to seek help when needed, which contributes to the positive and understanding relationship between the teacher and student.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically regarding the student's interest in language studies, mentioning their current study of French and plans to learn Spanish and German. This aligns with the dialogue where the student discusses their language studies. Additionally, the memory mentions the teacher's fluency in Spanish and French, which is relevant as it could relate to the teacher's ability to support or communicate with the student in those languages. The memory also mentions past events, like the student's heroic experience at the beach, which does not directly relate to the context but is still naturally phrased and does not detract from understanding the main context. This contributes to a clear understanding of the ongoing relationship dynamics between the student and teacher, hence making it helpful for generating a contextually appropriate response."
