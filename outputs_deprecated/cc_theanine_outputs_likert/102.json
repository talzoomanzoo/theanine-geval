    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I have some exciting plans for the future that I wanted to share with you.\nClassmates B: Oh really? What are they?\nClassmates A: Well, I was thinking that we could work on a project together and maybe even become business partners.\nClassmates B: Wow, that sounds amazing! What kind of project are you thinking about?\nClassmates A: I was thinking about starting a marketing agency specialized in social media.\nClassmates B: That's a great idea! I'd love to work with you on that. We could really make a difference in the industry.\nClassmates A: Yes, exactly! And I think our skills complement each other's so well.\nClassmates B: I totally agree. You're so creative and outgoing, while I'm more analytical and detail-oriented.\nClassmates A: It's like we were meant to work together, right?\nClassmates B: Absolutely! I can't wait to see what the future holds for us.\nClassmates A: Me too. And honestly, it's a bit of a relief to finally have a solid plan for the future.\nClassmates B: Yeah, I get that. Speaking of the future, how have you been doing with your sleeping problems?\nClassmates A: It's been a slow process, but I've been making progress with it. I started doing yoga and meditation before bed, and that's been helping a lot.\nClassmates B: That's great to hear. And what about your past struggles with school and friendships? Do you feel like you've moved on from that?\nClassmates A: Definitely. It's been a journey, but I've worked hard to overcome those obstacles. And now I feel like I'm finally on the right path.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates A encourages Classmates B to initiate conversations and be friendly to make new friends, causing Classmates B to appreciate Classmates A's gesture of buying coffee. In reaction, Classmates A agreed to try the suggestion and thanked Classmates B for it, wanting Classmates B to encourage them to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n\nClassmate A suggests planning a picnic in the park or a hike for the next outing with friends, and both Classmates A and B plan to relax at home later in the day. They both want to meet up again after getting better sleep, with Classmates B suggesting going back to school or taking courses to improve.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains fragments of past interactions between Classmates A and B, but it lacks coherence and clear relevance to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY mentions various activities, such as planning a picnic, a hike, and initiatives to improve social skills, which do not seem directly connected to the present discussion about starting a business and dealing with personal issues like sleeping problems and past struggles. The sentences are somewhat structured to suggest past communication, but they do not provide substantial or clearly interpretable context that would aid in generating a suitable continuation for the current conversation. As such, they do not supply helpful or directly relevant information to the language model in this context, thus warranting a score of 2."
