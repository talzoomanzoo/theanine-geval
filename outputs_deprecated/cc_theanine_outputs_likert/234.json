Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm sorry you had to hear me swear like that. I shouldn't have lost my temper like that.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A emphasized the importance of keeping outside spaces clean and maintained for the future. Neighbors B agrees and mentions the sense of community that is built through helping each other. Neighbors A and B are helpful towards each other. Neighbors B is supportive and understanding of Neighbors A's mistake. \nNeighbor A mentioned cleaning up a tree house to prevent insects and spiders from living in it. Neighbors B recalls when Neighbors A helped with their lawn, showing mutual support between them. Neighbors A values appreciation and expresses gratitude for help received. \nNeighbor A emphasized the importance of keeping outside spaces clean and maintained for the future. Neighbors A and B live in the same neighborhood and help each other with tasks. Neighbors A and B are helpful towards each other. Neighbors A is detail-oriented and strives for perfection.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides a lot of helpful information regarding the interactions between Neighbors A and B. It describes a mutual understanding, support, and a sense of community, which can help inform the language model about their relationship dynamics. This context is relevant, as it shows that Neighbor B is likely supportive and understanding, even when Neighbor A makes a mistake. This insight aligns well with the apology in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. \n\nMoreover, MEMORY content shows development and progression in Neighbors A and Bâ€™s relationship by mentioning shared activities and values such as cleaning and maintaining outdoor spaces, appreciation, and a supportive demeanor, which could be utilized in constructing a fitting response. \n\nWhile not every sentence is directly tied to the current dialogue, the natural phrasing and focus on mutual support still provide a coherent context for the model to build upon, making it easy to identify relevant cues. However, there is some repetition and slightly less focused details, which is why it does not completely reach a score of 5."
