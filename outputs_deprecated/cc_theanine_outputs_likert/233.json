Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Can you believe it? I'm a millionaire now!\nNeighbors B: Wow, that's incredible! How did it happen?\nNeighbors A: I inherited it from a distant relative. It's still sinking in, to be honest.\nNeighbors B: That's amazing, congratulations! What are you going to do with all that money?\nNeighbors A: Well, first I'm going to pay off my mortgage and all my debts. After that, I think I'll take a nice long vacation and maybe donate some to charity.\nNeighbors B: That's very generous of you. Have you thought about investing any of it?\nNeighbors A: Yes, actually. I've been doing some research and I think I want to invest in some stocks and maybe even start my own business.\nNeighbors B: That sounds like a great idea. You have the opportunity to do so much with your newfound wealth.\nNeighbors A: Definitely. It's funny how things can change so quickly. Just a few years ago, I was stuck in a job I hated and now I have all this freedom.\nNeighbors B: Speaking of jobs, have you thought about what you want to do now? You don't really have to work if you don't want to.\nNeighbors A: I know, but I don't think I could ever completely give up working. Plus, I have some ideas for businesses that I want to pursue. I think this money will give me the push I need to start something new.\nNeighbors B: I'm excited to see what you come up with. You're definitely one of the most driven people I know.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A made a big career change recently and is much happier now. This change caused Neighbors A to feel stagnant in their current job and look for more growth and challenge. Neighbors A and B had a conversation a couple of years ago about needing a change, which led to Neighbors A taking the leap to make a change and being glad they did.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful background information that could aid in understanding Neighbors A's mindset in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It indicates that Neighbors A had previously felt stagnant in their job and was seeking more growth and challenge, which is relevant to the current conversation about newfound wealth and the potential to start a new business. This background can help explain Neighbors A's motivation for wanting to pursue ideas for new businesses now that financial constraints are lifted. However, the MEMORY could be improved by offering more specific details about the kinds of changes Neighbors A made or how the past conversations with Neighbors B influenced Neighbors A's current decisions. The sentences in MEMORY do help tell a partial story of past interactions but could be more detailed and directly connected to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
