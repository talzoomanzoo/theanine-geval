Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Can you believe it? I'm a millionaire now!\nNeighbors B: Wow, that's incredible! How did it happen?\nNeighbors A: I inherited it from a distant relative. It's still sinking in, to be honest.\nNeighbors B: That's amazing, congratulations! What are you going to do with all that money?\nNeighbors A: Well, first I'm going to pay off my mortgage and all my debts. After that, I think I'll take a nice long vacation and maybe donate some to charity.\nNeighbors B: That's very generous of you. Have you thought about investing any of it?\nNeighbors A: Yes, actually. I've been doing some research and I think I want to invest in some stocks and maybe even start my own business.\nNeighbors B: That sounds like a great idea. You have the opportunity to do so much with your newfound wealth.\nNeighbors A: Definitely. It's funny how things can change so quickly. Just a few years ago, I was stuck in a job I hated and now I have all this freedom.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors B is supportive and believes Neighbors A's story about becoming a millionaire, suggesting looking up UFO sightings in the area. Neighbors A is tired from work and needs to catch up on sleep, but Neighbors B has been supportive of Neighbors A's job search, offering to connect them with people in different industries, which caused Neighbors A to make a big career change recently and become much happier. Neighbors A plans to do some research and possibly report the sighting of the UFO, and suggests planning something else to do together over the weekend, while also planning to start looking for new opportunities soon and updating their resume and start networking, which changed when Neighbors A took the leap to make a change and is glad they did. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's decision to make a big career change and admires the courage it took.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's truly amazing how life can take unexpected turns. I'm glad to see how happy and fulfilled you are now.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides context about the supportive relationship between Neighbors A and B, especially regarding career changes, which is consistent with Neighbors B being supportive in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Neighbors A's newfound wealth and plans. However, the MEMORY introduces unrelated elements such as UFO sightings, which could confuse the situation. The MEMORY offers useful insights about Neighbors A's recent career change and the support from Neighbors B, though it could be more directly relevant and concise to the current focus on financial and lifestyle changes because of Neighbors A's newly inherited wealth. The structure indicates development in their past interactions but is cluttered with irrelevant information making it somewhat challenging for a language model to parse out the beneficial information."
