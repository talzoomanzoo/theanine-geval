Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm sorry you had to hear me swear like that. I shouldn't have lost my temper like that.\nNeighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset?\nNeighbors A: It was just something that happened at work. My boss was being unreasonable and I couldn't take it anymore.\nNeighbors B: That's understandable. Have you tried talking to your boss about it?\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I have, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I just feel like I'm stuck in a dead-end job.\nNeighbors B: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you considered looking for a new job?\nNeighbors A: I have, but with the current job market, it's really tough. Plus, I don't have a lot of experience in other fields.\nNeighbors B: Well, I'll keep an ear out for any job openings that might be a good fit for you. In the meantime, maybe try finding ways to de-stress after work? I find that exercise helps me when I'm feeling frustrated.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A mentioned the importance of keeping outside spaces clean and maintained for the future. This aligns with the mutual support Neighbors A and B show each other, as seen when Neighbors A helped with their lawn. Additionally, Neighbors A values appreciation and expresses gratitude for help received, highlighting the supportive and helpful dynamic between them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided discusses the importance of keeping outside spaces clean and the mutual support Neighbors A and B have shown each other. However, this information is not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on Neighbors A's frustrations with their job and seeking advice from Neighbor B. While the supportive and helpful dynamic mentioned in the MEMORY could potentially be linked to the advice and support shown in the dialogue, the MEMORY lacks specific details or contextual cues related to the current conversation about job dissatisfaction and stress relief strategies. Hence, the MEMORY is not very helpful in generating a proper next response in the context of the given dialogue."
