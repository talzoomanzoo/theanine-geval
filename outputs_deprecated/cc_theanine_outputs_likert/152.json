Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today.\nClassmates B:  That sounds great. What was the talk about?\nClassmates A: It was about the history of the pyramids in Egypt. I learned so much about their construction and the cultural significance they held.\nClassmates B: Wow, that does sound interesting. Did you take any notes?\n\nMEMORY:\n- [Classmate B is interested in attending a new technology conference next month.] - (React) - [Classmates B noticed Classmates A's improvement and acknowledged their hard work.] - (React) - [Classmates B is supportive of Classmates A's new relationship and believes they found someone who makes them happy.] \n- [Classmate B is working on finishing a history project.] - (HinderedBy) - [Classmates A had a moment of frustration in the past but has learned to channel that energy into studies.] - (React) - [Classmates A is willing to work hard to achieve their dreams.] - (Want) - [Classmates A is not afraid to be themselves and embraces their quirks, which their girlfriend appreciates.] \n- [Classmate B is interested in attending a new technology conference next month.] - (SameTopic) - [Classmates A's grades are looking good according to their teacher.] - (React) - [Classmates A values being true to themselves and expressing their own style.] - (Want) - [Classmates A is not afraid to be themselves and embraces their quirks, which their girlfriend appreciates.]\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does not contain any helpful or relevant information for generating a proper response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT about a talk on the history of the pyramids in Egypt. Most of the sentences in the MEMORY are unrelated to the topic of discussion in the dialogue context, including references to technology conferences, personal relationships, and academic achievements, which do not contribute to understanding the context of the conversation about the talk Classmates A attended. Also, the structure does not seem to reflect any clear causality, connection, or development associated with the dialogue context. As a result, the MEMORY fails to provide essential contextual cues that would assist in generating an appropriate continuation of the dialogue."
