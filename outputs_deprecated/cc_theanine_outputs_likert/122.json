Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I'm the boss!\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A is known for being competent and is trusted with important projects. This reputation is further reinforced when Co-worker A returned a watch to Co-worker B, making them happy again. Additionally, Co-worker A had a teddy bear that they received as a gift from their grandma and used to carry it everywhere.\n\n2. Co-worker A enjoys helping others and takes pride in their work. This trait is evident in how Co-worker A is seen as competent and reliable by Co-worker B. Furthermore, Co-worker A has a history of helping out Co-worker B and values their friendship.\n\n3. Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace. This recognition is highlighted when Co-worker A returned a watch to Co-worker B, making them happy again. Moreover, Co-worker B received their watch back from Co-worker A a few months ago, repairing their friendship, which was initially rekindled when Co-worker A returned Co-worker B's watch a few years ago.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides moderately helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It offers contextual information about Co-worker A's positive attributes, such as competence, reliability, and a good work ethic, which align with Co-worker A claiming to be \"the boss\" in the dialogue context. However, the specific events in the MEMORY, like returning a watch and the history with a teddy bear, do not directly relate to or build upon Co-worker A's proclamation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memories include development and connections (like repairing friendship), but they are not clearly tied to the current context of Co-worker A asserting dominance. While the structure is logical and the sentences are well-phrased, their direct relevance to the dialogue context is limited, leading to a mid-range score."
