Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I can't believe I got caught cheating on my taxes. This is such a mess.\nClassmates B: Wait, what? You cheated on your taxes? That's not okay.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B advise Classmates A to stay focused on their goal, believe in themselves, and ask for help if needed, which Classmates A acknowledges and agrees to, staying confident and focusing on delivery.\n\n2. Classmates A believes in hard work and dedication to achieve goals both in basketball and their job, as they are pursuing a dream of becoming a professional basketball player and working at a grocery store to save up money for training.\n\n3. Classmate B reassures Classmate A that they are all in it together and offers help if needed, supporting Classmates A who has a big dream of becoming a professional basketball player and works hard towards that goal.\n\n4. Classmates A appreciates the support and understanding from Classmate B, who brought goods to Classmate A's house and is supportive of their basketball dream.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains general background information about Classmate A's aspirations and Classmate B's support, which is relatively useful in understanding their relationship. However, it provides no direct or relevant information to the specific issue of cheating on taxes mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY does not contain details or interactions that clarify why Classmate A might have cheated or how they are handling the situation, rendering it less helpful for generating a response to the specific dialogue context. The information is not structured to demonstrate causality or development relating directly to the issue at hand. Thus, it is not very beneficial for the language model to generate an appropriate and informed response to the current context."
