    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hi there, I was wondering if you'd like to join me for lunch on Tuesday at the school cafeteria.\nCo-workers B: Oh, sure. Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking?\nCo-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for asking me to join you.\nCo-workers A: No problem, it'll be great to catch up. Hey, do you remember when we talked about me being irresponsible a few years ago?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, I remember that conversation. What about it?\nCo-workers A: Well, I wanted to share some good news with you. I've been recently promoted to the night shift and have been doing a great job. I think I've come a long way since those days.\nCo-workers B: That's awesome, congratulations! I'm proud of you and all the hard work you've put in. You've definitely grown and matured in the workplace.\nCo-workers A: Thank you, I appreciate that. But I have to admit, I'm still a bit nervous about being wrong. Remember when we talked about my constantly questioning myself and second-guessing my decisions?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, I remember that. Is there anything specific that's been bothering you?\nCo-workers A: Not really, it's just a general feeling of uncertainty at times. But hey, speaking of uncertainty, do you remember when we talked about my love for singing a while ago?\nCo-workers B: Yes, I do. How's that been going for you?\nCo-workers A: It's actually been going really well. I recently auditioned for a major singing competition and was chosen as a finalist.\nCo-workers B: Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations, I had no idea you were still pursuing singing.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it's always been a passion of mine. It's nice to know that my hard work is paying off. But anyways, I'm really excited for lunch on Tuesday, it's been a while since we've caught up.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B mentioned that Co-worker A is responsible in their work, even if not always in other aspects of life, and Co-worker A is trying to be more conscious of how their actions impact others and avoid causing problems for anyone else. Co-worker B reminds Co-worker A of their progress and potential for success.\n\nCo-worker A has made mistakes in the past but is trying to be more aware of their actions, which causes Co-worker B to have moved on from their arrest and appreciate Co-worker A's concern and change in behavior. Co-worker B reassures Co-worker A and encourages them to have more confidence.\n\nCo-worker A has made mistakes in the past but is trying to be more aware of their actions, which changed to Co-worker A has been working hard on their singing skills and has a passion for music.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I can't wait to hear more about your singing journey over lunch. It sounds like you've been making great progress.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information that is moderately helpful for generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures some elements of Co-worker A's progress and efforts to be more responsible, as well as their passion for singing. This aligns with key themes discussed in the dialogue, such as Co-worker A's promotion, development at work, and achievements in singing. However, the MEMORY could be more structured and coherent in representing the conversation's development and past interactions. Some sentences are a bit disjointed or repetitive, such as Co-worker A's past mistakes and current awareness. Additionally, certain details like Co-worker B's personal experiences or feelings (e.g., moving on from their arrest) aren't explicitly mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which may introduce unnecessary complexity. A more concise and tightly connected MEMORY would improve comprehension and support a more accurate generation of the next response."
