Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey, can you keep a secret?\nNeighbors B: Of course, what's up?\nNeighbors A: I can't be seen because I am hiding from my mom behind the door.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A enjoys cooking and made roasted vegetables and quinoa for dinner. Neighbors A and B are discussing the idea of having telekinetic abilities. Neighbors B is excited and supportive of Neighbors A's new ability. Neighbors B offers support and suggests planning a dinner to celebrate Neighbor A's new adventures in learning.\nNeighbors B is open to trying new recipes and is excited to receive the chickpea curry recipe from Neighbors A. Neighbors A and B joke about the fun aspects of using telekinesis to surprise people, causing Neighbors A to feel overwhelmed but also excited about their new ability. Neighbor A is thinking about exploring new skills or hobbies outside of work, such as taking online courses or learning a new language. Neighbors B is interested in Neighbors A's cooking and asks about the vegetables and quinoa preparation. Neighbors A and B are discussing the idea of having telekinetic abilities, with Neighbors B being excited and supportive of Neighbors A's new ability, which makes Neighbor A feel there is no room for growth or new projects at their current job.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information about past interactions between Neighbors A and B, such as Neighbors A's cooking, discussions about telekinetic abilities, and Neighbors A considering new skills or hobbies. However, the MEMORY lacks direct relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is about Neighbors A hiding from their mom. The MEMORY does share some potentially useful dynamics, such as Neighbors B's supportiveness and excitement for new experiences, but these do not directly connect to the current scenario presented in the context. The sentences are somewhat naturally phrased, yet they do not provide a strong causal or relevant link that would help generate a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Thus, the MEMORY is somewhat informative but not particularly helpful in generating a suitable next response based on the given context."
