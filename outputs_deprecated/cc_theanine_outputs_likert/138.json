Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just visited this amazing new city. The architecture was stunning, the streets were so clean, and the people were very friendly.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like you had a great time! Which city did you visit?\nNeighbors A: It was Chicago. I had never been before, but it exceeded all my expectations.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A and Neighbor B appreciate each other as good neighbors and have organized a block party together in the past. This camaraderie causes Neighbors A to enjoy living in the neighborhood, feeling comfortable and safe, and has made good friends, including Neighbors B. The strong bond is evident as Neighbors A values the relationship with Neighbors B and considers them like family. This mutual appreciation leads Neighbors A to be excited to explore the neighborhood and make new friends. \n\nNeighbor A and Neighbor B appreciate each other as good neighbors and have organized a block party together in the past.

    "raw_prediction": "Chicago is such a vibrant city, glad you had a wonderful experience there!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some background information about the relationship and camaraderie between Neighbors A and B, which could be beneficial to generate responses in some cases. However, in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where the conversation focuses on Neighbors A's visit to Chicago, the MEMORY does not provide much relevant information that directly aids in generating an appropriate next response. The MEMORY is repetitive and primarily emphasizes the bond between the neighbors and their appreciation of the neighborhood, which is not directly related to the topic of Chicago. While the connection and relationship between the neighbors are well articulated, making it easier to identify their strong relationship, it lacks the causality or development relevant to the current dialogue about Neighbors A's travel experience. Therefore, it only marginally helps in understanding the context and guiding a response directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
