Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Mentee, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends.\nMentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\nMentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here.\nMentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people.\nMentee: Those are good suggestions, Mentor. I'll consider joining a club or volunteering.\nMentor: And remember, it's also important to keep in touch with your old friends. You can schedule video calls or even plan a visit back home.\nMentee: That's true, I'll make sure to keep in touch. Thanks for the advice, Mentor.\nMentor: Anytime, Mentee. Is there anything else you want to talk about or any updates you'd like to share?\n\nMEMORY:\n- The Mentor has been guiding and supporting the Mentee in their work for years. This has led to the Mentor being supportive and praising the Mentee for their mature decision-making process, which made the Mentee agree to go back to the store to make things right and express gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n- The Mentor believes the Mentee's work has been influential and that they will continue to make an impact in the world. This resulted in Mentor reassuring Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace.\n- The Mentee hopes to inspire others to join the cause of gender equality and fighting discrimination. As a result, the Mentee expresses gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process, causing the Mentee to agree to go back to the store to make things right and express gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains sentences about the relationship between the Mentor and Mentee, indicating past interactions and mutual respect. However, the specific details provided are not directly related to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where the Mentee is expressing loneliness in a new city. The MEMORY mentions themes of guidance and gratitude, but these are not connected to the Mentee's present issue of feeling isolated or the Mentor's advice on making new connections and keeping in touch with old friends. The structure of the MEMORY doesn't clearly convey the development of events or interactions relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which limits its helpfulness. A higher score would require more direct relevance to the specific situation being addressed in the conversation."
