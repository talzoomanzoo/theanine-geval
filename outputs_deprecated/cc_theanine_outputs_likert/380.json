Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to share something with you. I helped out a neighbor in need over the weekend.\nClassmates B: That's really kind of you. What did you do to help?\nClassmates A: She was moving and needed some extra hands to pack up her things and load them onto a truck. So I spent most of the day helping her out.\nClassmates B: Wow, that's really generous of you. I'm sure your neighbor really appreciated it.\nClassmates A: I hope so. I just felt like it was the right thing to do. I know if I were in that situation, I would appreciate any help I could get.\nClassmates B: Absolutely. It's important to be there for each other, especially in tough times.\nClassmates A: Yes, and it feels good to make a difference in someone's life, even if it's just in a small way.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates B's responsible handling of a previous class schedule mix-up led to them being supportive and helpful to Classmates A. Classmates B's advice to drive safely was well-received by Classmates A. \nClassmates B's thorough double-checking to prevent future issues made Classmates A concerned about their drinking habits and health. Despite initial worries, Classmates B values Classmates A's opinions. \nThe mutual appreciation between Classmates A and B has sparked plans to hang out outside of school.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's really admirable that you took the time to help your neighbor. Small acts of kindness can make a big impact.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY text provides a moderate level of support for generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It supplies a background of previous interactions between Classmates A and B, suggesting that they have a supportive relationship and mutual appreciation. This context is somewhat helpful as it implies Classmates B's positive view and supportive nature towards Classmates A, which aligns with the ongoing supportive conversation about Classmates A's good deed. However, the MEMORY text introduces unrelated details, such as concerns about drinking habits and plans to hang out, which do not directly relate to the current dialogue about helping a neighbor. Furthermore, the structure of these sentences does not strongly highlight their relevance to the current context. This makes it less helpful for generating a focused response in line with the ongoing discussion about kindness and helping others."
