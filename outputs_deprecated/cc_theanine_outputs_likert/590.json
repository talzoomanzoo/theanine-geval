Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Husband, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I'm feeling stuck with my writing. I've been searching everywhere for new ideas, but nothing seems to work.\nWife: Have you tried brainstorming with me? Sometimes bouncing ideas off of someone else can help.\nHusband: I have, but I don't want to bother you too much with my writing stuff.\nWife: Nonsense! You can always come to me with anything. Plus, I enjoy helping you with your creative process. Have you also tried revisiting some of the writing prompts we did in our creative writing class?\nHusband: I have, but I feel like I'm just repeating the same stories over and over again.\nWife: Maybe it's time to take a step back and try something new. Have you ever tried writing in a different genre or experimenting with different styles?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The wife sharing her passion for movies with the husband led to her suggesting using more modern language for better understanding.\n2. Both the husband and wife expressing a desire for happiness and understanding resulted in the husband agreeing to adapt to modern language for improved communication.\n3. The husband's willingness to try again about movies changed into him being honest about his feelings for Sarah, leading to an agreement to use modern language for better communication.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I haven't really explored different genres or styles, but that might be worth a shot. Thanks for the suggestion.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some information that could potentially be useful in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the idea of adapting language for better communication, which may be relevant for the husband's writing process. However, the sentences in the MEMORY are not directly relevant to the dialogue about the husband's writing struggles and do not clearly demonstrate a connection or development that would assist in generating a response in the given context. The mention of the husband's feelings for Sarah is out of place and does not relate to the current interaction about writing. Overall, while there is a hint of useful information, it lacks clarity and direct applicability, hence the low score."
