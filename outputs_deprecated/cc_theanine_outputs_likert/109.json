Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, have you noticed how strong I've become?\nNeighbors B: Wow, you do look very strong! Have you been working out?\nNeighbors A: Yes, I go to the gym every day and lift weights. It's been really helping me build muscle.\nNeighbors B: That's great to hear! It reminds me of the time when you apologized to me for the way you treated me.\nNeighbors A: Yes, I realized that I needed to take responsibility for my actions and I didn't want to make the same mistake again.\nNeighbors B: It's always important to own up to our mistakes. It's like when you forgot your backpack in high school and had to deal with the consequences.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Neighbors A and B discussed the importance of caring for trees and the environment for future generations, which led to Neighbor B accepting Neighbor A's apology and expressing how hurtful the previous treatment was. This prompted Neighbor A to apologize and acknowledge their wrongdoing.\n   \n2. Neighbors A and B talked about the significance of preserving trees and the environment for the future, prompting Neighbor A to apologize to Neighbor B and show willingness to make things right. In response, Neighbor B reminded Neighbor A about the importance of taking responsibility for past mistakes and learning from them, which led to Neighbor A apologizing and admitting fault.\n\n3. Neighbors A and B recognized the value of using fallen trees for firewood or other purposes, which led to Neighbor A apologizing to Neighbor B and expressing a desire to mend their relationship. This apology caused Neighbors A and B to address their issues and maintain a friendly bond.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I remember that! It's so crucial to learn from our mistakes and be accountable for our actions. It's like how we should always strive to be better each day.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides several instances in which Neighbors A and B discuss taking responsibility, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, there are references to past apologies and acknowledgments of wrongdoings, aligning with the current theme of owning up to mistakes. However, the specific details connecting environmental discussions with their apologies seem somewhat extraneous and may not directly benefit generating the next response based on the current context about getting stronger and acknowledging past behavior. The MEMORY does present a clear development of past interactions, but the connection between these past dialogues and the present context could be more clearly defined to be more helpful."
