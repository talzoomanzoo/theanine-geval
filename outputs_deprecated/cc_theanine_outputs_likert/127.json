Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I'm the boss!\nCo-workers B: Yeah, we know. You don't have to remind us every five minutes.\nCo-workers A: I just want everything to go smoothly and according to plan.\nCo-workers B: I understand that, but it doesn't always have to be your way or the highway.\nCo-workers A: Well, I just think that my way is usually the best way.\nCo-workers B: And sometimes it is, but we all have different ideas and perspectives to bring to the table.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A is known for being competent and is trusted with important projects. This is reflected in how both Co-worker A and Co-worker B excel at working well with others and resolving issues. Additionally, Co-worker A is giving Co-worker B a massage to help them relax.\n\nBoth Co-worker A and Co-worker B value communication and understanding in relationships. This aligns with how they enjoy taking moments to connect with each other, finding these moments make work more enjoyable. Moreover, Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's competence and effort in their work, seeing Co-worker A as competent and reliable.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I agree, diversity in perspectives can lead to better outcomes. Let's try to find a balance between our ideas for the next project.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It effectively highlights the competence and reliability of Co-worker A, which aligns with the dialogue where Co-worker A believes their way is best due to their track record. It also presents positive interactions between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, emphasizing their shared values of communication and understanding, which connects to Co-worker B's insistence on multiple perspectives. The MEMORY naturally conveys the development of their working relationship, supporting the generation of a coherent response. However, it lacks specific past incidents or detailed examples that directly tie to the current issue being discussed in the dialogue, which is why it is not rated a perfect 5."
