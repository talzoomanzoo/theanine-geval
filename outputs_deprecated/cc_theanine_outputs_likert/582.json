Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination.\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off.\nNeighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks?\nNeighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else.\nNeighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location?\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home.\nNeighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become.\nNeighbors A: You're right, I need to stop making excuses and just get it done. Thanks for the advice.\nNeighbors B: No problem. Speaking of goals, how's the house project coming along? \nNeighbors A: It's finished! Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard. It was a lot of work, but worth it in the end. \nNeighbors B: That's amazing, thanks for building me such a beautiful house. \nNeighbors A: Of course, I'm glad you like it. Remember when we watched the sunset over the London skyline? That was such a beautiful moment.\nNeighbors B: Yes, I still remember the pink and orange hues reflecting off the buildings. It was breathtaking.\nNeighbors A: Speaking of London, have you heard about those recent cases of identity theft? It's terrible that people like that exist.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A's enjoyment in building houses quickly led them to help Neighbor B construct a new house with incredible features. This experience changed Neighbor A's perspective as they found the process challenging yet rewarding.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Neighbors B",
    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I read about it in the news. It's unfortunate how some individuals take advantage of others like that.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically relating to the part of the conversation where Neighbor B asks about the house project and Neighbor A confirms its completion. The memory mentions Neighbor A's enjoyment and perspective on building houses, which aligns with the context of them helping build Neighbor B's house. However, the MEMORY is somewhat limited in detail and does not provide extensive background on the interactions or other discussion points in the dialogue, like procrastination or identity theft, which reduces its overall helpfulness. Nonetheless, it is structured relatively well and naturally."
