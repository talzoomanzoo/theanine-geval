Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: It's great to have friends who can help each other out, isn't it?\nNeighbors B: Absolutely. It's a two-way street, and it's important to be there for each other.\nNeighbors A: I remember when I helped you move last year, and then you watched my cat when I went on vacation.\nNeighbors B: Yes, and I appreciate it so much. It's always nice to have someone you can count on.\nNeighbors A: That's true. And speaking of which, I'm helping another friend move next weekend. It'll be a big job, but I know they'd do the same for me.\nNeighbors B: That's great. And if you need any help, just let me know.\nNeighbors A: Thanks, I will. I always feel like I can ask for help when I need it, and that's a really good feeling.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A thanked Neighbors B for the suggestion to visit their shop, where Neighbors A found a new necklace and loved it. This led to a discussion on the importance of strength in apologizing, with both neighbors agreeing on the sentiment.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad to hear that you have a strong support system. It's important to have friends you can rely on.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains a past interaction between Neighbors A and B about visiting a shop and discussing the importance of apologizing, which is not directly related to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY does not provide much helpful information for generating a next response based on the current conversation, which is centered around helping each other and mutual support. The sentences in MEMORY are somewhat relevant to the concept of friendship (in terms of mutual understanding), but they do not clearly demonstrate the development or connection with the current conversation about helping with moving or taking care of pets. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it was more directly related to past instances of helping each other, similar to those mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
