Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something.\nClassmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\nClassmates A: Well, it’s been on my mind for a while now and I couldn’t shake it off. I just can't stop thinking about you.\nClassmates B: Oh, really?\nClassmates A: Yes, really. I know we've been friends for a while now, but I feel like there may be something more between us.\nClassmates B: Hmm, I never thought about it that way. But I can’t deny that we have a great connection.\nClassmates A: Exactly! I just feel like we could be more than just friends. If it's something you're open to, of course.\nClassmates B: I get what you’re saying,. And to be honest, I’ve had similar thoughts lately. I’m definitely open to exploring this.\nClassmates A: I’m so relieved to hear that. I was worried that I might be crossing a line by expressing my feelings.\nClassmates B: No, not at all. I’m glad you did. It takes courage to express your true feelings. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B share a strong bond as supportive friends, offering help and reassurance to each other during stressful times.\n2. Classmates A recalls a moment when they admired Classmate B's courage in sharing a secret, showcasing their compassionate nature.\n3. Classmates B feels relieved to confide in someone about a secret they've been carrying.\n4. Classmates A appreciates Classmates B's support and advice while working on a group project together, especially because of their tendency to overthink things.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memory mentions a strong bond between Classmates A and B, which is relevant to the current dialogue as they are discussing feelings and exploring a deeper connection. The specific points in the memory, such as admiration for courage, confiding secrets, and support during a group project, demonstrate a history of meaningful interactions and mutual support, which aligns with the discussion in the context about feelings and connections. The sentences are naturally structured and demonstrate clear development and relevance to their interaction style, enabling a language model to easily identify important contextual cues and produce a coherent next response. However, some specifics from the MEMORY could be better tailored to directly address the context of romantic feelings rather than general support, hence the rating of 4 instead of 5."
