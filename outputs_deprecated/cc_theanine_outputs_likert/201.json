    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager!\nCo-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge.\nCo-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail.\nCo-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of new products, remember when you used to fantasize about being a great leader?\nCo-workers A: Ha, yeah. That seems like ages ago.\nCo-workers B: Well, now you can finally take on that leadership role and make your dreams a reality.\nCo-workers A: That's true. It's amazing how life works out sometimes. But it hasn't always been smooth sailing. Remember when I was really stressed about you not liking me?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, I remember. But we worked through it, didn't we?\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A has aspirations of being a great leader and emphasizes the importance of communication. This aligns with Co-worker B believing that Co-worker A has the potential to be a great leader if they use their power for good. Additionally, Co-worker A used to fantasize about being a great leader and being respected and admired, showing a consistent desire for leadership roles.\n\nCo-worker A has grown and become more confident over the years, as seen in their shift from feeling embarrassed for losing control of their emotions to now feeling ready for the challenge of a leadership position. This growth is further supported by Co-worker B encouraging Co-worker A to consider pursuing a leadership position and highlighting the qualities of a good leader.\n\nBoth Co-workers agree that a good working relationship is important, reflecting their shared values of improvement and pushing themselves to be better.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm grateful for your support during that time. It's been a journey, but I'm glad we've grown and learned from those challenges.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides a cohesive overview of Co-worker A's development and aspirations towards leadership, which is highly relevant to the current dialogue context. The memory highlights Co-worker A's desire for leadership, their growth in confidence, and their focus on communication, all of which align with Co-worker A's promotion to a product manager. This information offers valuable insight into Co-worker A's mindset and goals, helping generate a proper response in the context of the conversation.\n\nHowever, while the MEMORY effectively captures the essence of Co-worker A's aspirations and development, it could be more directly connected to specific elements of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Co-worker B's comments about Co-worker A's past concerns regarding their working relationship. Including these details could make the MEMORY even more helpful in suggesting relevant responses.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY is well-structured and provides pertinent information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, justifying a score of 4."
