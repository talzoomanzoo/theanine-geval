Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately.\nClassmates B: Why is that?\nClassmates A: I want to be smart and I think algebra can help me think more logically and critically.\nClassmates B: That's a good goal to have. Have you noticed any improvements in your thinking since studying algebra?\nClassmates A: Definitely. I feel like I'm able to break down problems and analyze them more effectively.\nClassmates B: It's always rewarding when hard work pays off.\nClassmates A: Yes it is. It reminds me of when I proved my brother wrong in that race. I was so determined to win and it paid off in the end.\nClassmates B: It's great to see that determination and hard work lead to success in different areas of life.\nClassmates A: And even when I felt that pain in my arm, I waited and it eventually went away.\nClassmates B: It's important to listen to your body and take care of yourself.\nClassmates A: Exactly. And sometimes, it's nice to just take a break and enjoy a quiet moment to yourself.\nClassmates B: Like when you were admiring the patterns in the ceiling?\n\nMEMORY:\n- Classmates B acknowledges Classmates A's determination and competitiveness. This leads to Classmates B offering support and suggesting taking a step back to find a balance. This is followed by Classmates A expressing worry about a situation due to not having experienced similar pains in the past.\n- Classmates A faced tough competition in middle school from a fast girl, which motivated them to improve. This resonates with Classmates B emphasizing the importance of enjoying the journey and effort put in, rather than just focusing on winning. Both classmates value taking moments to relax and appreciate small things.\n- Classmates A is always looking to challenge themselves and improve their skills. This results in Classmates B emphasizing the importance of enjoying the journey and effort put in, not just focusing on winning. Both classmates value taking moments to relax and appreciate small things.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, exactly. It's those little moments of peace that help recharge me for the next challenge.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful information about the dynamics between Classmates A and B. It highlights Classmates A's determination and drive to improve themselves, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Classmates A talks about focusing on studying algebra and becoming more logical. Additionally, the MEMORY notes Classmates B's acknowledgment of Classmates A's competitiveness and their emphasis on finding a balance, which is relevant given Classmates B's supportive responses in the dialogue. However, the MEMORY is somewhat repetitive and lacks a clear development or causality relating to specific past interactions, making it less directly helpful in generating a next response. The MEMORY does not specifically address the conversation about algebra or the race, and the reference to \"appreciating small things\" does not directly tie into the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Overall, while the MEMORY has some relevant elements, it could better capture the specific past interactions to be more helpful."
