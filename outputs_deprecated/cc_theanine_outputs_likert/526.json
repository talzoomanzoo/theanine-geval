Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just can't believe he left me like that. I thought we were happy together.\nNeighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left?\nNeighbors A: No, I haven't. I don't even know what I would say to him. I feel like I'm not enough, like I wasn't good enough for him.\nNeighbors B: That's not true, Neighbor A. You are an amazing person and you deserve someone who appreciates you for who you are.\nNeighbors A: I just feel so lost right now. I don't know how to move on from this.\nNeighbors B: It's going to take time, but you will get through this. Do you want to talk about how you're feeling or do something to take your mind off of things?\nNeighbors A: Maybe both? I just feel so overwhelmed and I don't know what to do.\nNeighbors B: How about we go for a walk and you can talk to me about everything that's been on your mind?\nNeighbors A: That sounds good. You've always been such a good listener, Neighbor B. Thank you for being there for me.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Neighbor A and Neighbor B share a close bond and often spend time together outside of their neighborhood, especially going for walks to the park.\n- Neighbor A values the emotional support and understanding provided by Neighbor B during times of grief.\n- Neighbor A and Neighbor B like to grab a meal together after their activities, creating a sense of companionship.\n- Neighbor B used to mention the neighborhood's affluence, but now finds peace in taking walks in the park to clear their mind.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm always here for you, Neighbor A. Let's take that walk and clear your mind.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides several helpful pieces of information that support Neighbors B in generating a suitable response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It establishes the close bond between Neighbors A and B, highlighting their history of spending time together and B's emotional support for A during difficult times. This is directly relevant to the current conversation where Neighbor B is offering support to Neighbor A after a breakup, showing a consistent and supportive relationship dynamic. Additionally, the memory states that they often go for walks, which directly ties into the suggestion in the dialogue of taking a walk for both engagement and distraction. However, the mention of the neighborhood's affluence and grabbing meals, though not entirely irrelevant, seems slightly less pertinent to the immediate context. The sentences are naturally connected and provide a coherent background that aids in understanding the current emotional and relational nuances between the neighbors."
