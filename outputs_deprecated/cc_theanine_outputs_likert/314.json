Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I can't believe how honored I am to be part of our class. I feel like we have something special going on here.\nClassmates B:  You're right. Our class definitely has a unique energy about it. What do you think sets us apart from other classes?\nClassmates A:  I think it's our sense of community. We all support each other and work together to achieve our goals.\nClassmates B:  That's definitely a big factor. And I also think our class has a lot of diversity, which brings new perspectives and ideas to the table.\nClassmates A:  Yes, absolutely. I love hearing everyone's different viewpoints and experiences. It really helps us all grow and learn.\nClassmates B:  And it's not just in the classroom, but also in extracurricular activities and events. We always have a strong turnout and participation.\nClassmates A:  I couldn't agree more. And I feel like being part of our class has made me a better person overall. I've learned so much and grown so much as a result.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. [Classmates B enjoys people watching at the mall.] - (React) - [Classmate B is disappointed when Classmate A does not feel the same way.] - (React) - [Classmates B complimented Classmates A on their suit and brought up a past conversation about feelings.]\n   \n2. [Classmates A and B are both interested in going to the mall near their school.] - (SameTopic) - [Classmate B feels relieved that they can still be friends with Classmate A.] - (React) - [Classmates B appreciates Classmates A's honesty about their feelings, but doesn't feel the same way.] - (Causes) - [Classmates A confessed their love for Classmates B, who does not feel the same way.]\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I completely agree. Our class has definitely had a positive impact on all of us. It's great to see how much we've all grown and learned together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some information about past interactions between Classmates A and B, particularly in regard to a confession of love and feelings not being reciprocated. However, these memories do not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on class dynamics, community, diversity, and personal growth. The details about trips to the mall and unfulfilled feelings do not contribute to generating a response that follows the current context of the dialogue. The memories are also structured in a way that makes it difficult to see a direct connection or development relating to the current dialogue, thus offering limited helpfulness in generating a contextually relevant response."
