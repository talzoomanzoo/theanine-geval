Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, check out this spot I found to camp out for the night. It's perfect!\nClassmates B: Wow, this view is amazing!\nClassmates A: I know, right? And it's completely level and free of any debris. We won't have to worry about rolling off our sleeping pads or anything like that.\nClassmates B: It definitely looks like a great spot to spend the night. How did you manage to find it?\nClassmates A: Just a stroke of luck, I guess. I was exploring the area and stumbled upon it. It's always good to be a little adventurous and explore new places, you never know what you might find.\nClassmates B: That's true. You always seem to find the best spots. Like that time we went camping near the lake and had the whole place to ourselves.\nClassmates A: Oh yeah, that was a great spot too. It's always fun to explore and go on new adventures.\nClassmates B: Definitely. And it's also important to be prepared and bring all the necessary camping gear, like extra food and water, first-aid items, and warm clothes.\nClassmates A: Absolutely. Safety should always come first when we're out in the wilderness.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates A is proactive and curious, taking the initiative to research topics of interest. This aligns with Classmates B finding Classmates A's involvement in the community admirable and important. Additionally, Classmates B remembers Classmates A's previous involvement in community improvement projects and acknowledges their passion for making a difference, which is in the same topic as their current proactive behavior.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "You're really good at being prepared for our camping trips. It makes the whole experience much more enjoyable and stress-free.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains some relevant character traits of Classmates A, which could potentially assist in understanding their adventurous and proactive nature as demonstrated in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY does not offer specific information about past interactions or shared experiences between Classmates A and B that would enrich the current dialogue. The focus of the MEMORY is more on Classmates A's general characteristics related to community involvement rather than on camping or outdoor activities, which is the central theme of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Therefore, it doesn't provide much direct assistance for generating a continuation of the conversation, though it does contain slight relevant hints about Classmates A being proactive and explorative."
