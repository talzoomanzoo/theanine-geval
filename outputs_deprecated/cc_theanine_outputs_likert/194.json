Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager!\nCo-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Co-worker A feels embarrassed for losing control of their emotions after having grown and become more confident over the years.\n- Co-worker A is focused on getting along and working smoothly with Co-worker B, who acknowledges and supports Co-worker A's growth and progress.\n- Co-worker A considers taking on more responsibility at work as a start towards being a leader, while both co-workers agree that a good working relationship is important.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I have no doubt that you'll excel in your new role. Your growth and progress have been impressive.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains relevant details about Co-worker A's feelings of growth, confidence, and readiness to take on more responsibility, which aligns with the context of their recent promotion to product manager. Additionally, the MEMORY describes Co-worker B's supportive role, emphasizing the importance of their working relationship, which is pertinent to the conversation about moving into a leadership position. However, the first memory about Co-worker A's embarrassment might not be directly relevant to the current exchange, but it is phrased in a way that doesn't hinder understanding of the context. Overall, the MEMORY provides useful background that could assist in constructing a coherent and contextually appropriate response."
