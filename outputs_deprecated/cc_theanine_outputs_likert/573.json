Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination.\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off.\nNeighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks?\nNeighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else.\nNeighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A values their friendship with Neighbor B, describing them as a great neighbor, which prompts Neighbor A to consider using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder. \nNeighbor A helped Neighbor B build a new house with amazing features, leading Neighbor B to remind Neighbor A of their potential to do good things and referencing the house that Neighbor A built for them. This makes Neighbor A want to believe that plants need sunlight, water, and love to thrive.\nNeighbor A enjoys building houses and finishing them quickly, which changed their belief to make a lot of money without hurting anyone and plan to cover their tracks carefully.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided has some potential elements that could be helpful in understanding the dialogue context, such as the references to Neighbor A's skills and the relationship between Neighbor A and Neighbor B. However, it primarily consists of information that doesn't directly connect to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT or aid in generating a relevant response about procrastination and focus. The statements about building houses, making money, and caring for plants do not have clear relevancy to the conversation about productivity strategies. The passages also lack clear causality or development between the sentences, making it challenging for a language model to extract useful contextual cues related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
