Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, did I tell you that I went to the post office today?\nCo-workers B: No, you didn't. What did you do there?\nCo-workers A: I paid for postage to send a package. It was a bit of a hassle, but I got it done.\nCo-workers B: That's good. I hate going to the post office. It's always so crowded.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it was pretty busy today. But I needed to get this package sent out.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of packages, remember that time when you got stranded because you couldn't drive yourself home from a night out with friends?\nCo-workers A: Ugh, don't remind me. That was such a disaster.\nCo-workers B: It was definitely not one of your finest moments. But it's good to see that you're being responsible now and taking care of things like sending packages.\nCo-workers A: Thanks. I'm trying to be more responsible and reliable these days.\nCo-workers B: That's great to hear. It reminds me of the time when you were a great leader in your country. You were strong, determined, and made a positive impact.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B advises Co-worker A to be more disciplined and plan ahead for their actions. This reminds Co-worker A of the time when they were a leader in their country, making it prosperous and safe.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does provide some relevant information connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, specifically about Co-worker A's past as a leader in their country, adhering to Co-worker B's statement about Co-worker A's leadership qualities. However, the MEMORY lacks a smoothly structured narrative or causal development, as it mostly repeats the idea of Co-worker A's leadership without much additional information or depth. The sentences are relevant but could be more effectively and organically integrated with the ongoing dialogue to achieve a clearer depiction of past interactions. "
