    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just got back from my trip to South America. It was amazing!\nNeighbors B: Oh really? Where did you go?\nNeighbors A: I visited Brazil and Peru. The culture and food were incredible.\nNeighbors B: That sounds awesome. I've always wanted to go to Peru to see Machu Picchu.\nNeighbors A: Yes, Machu Picchu is amazing. The view from the top is breathtaking.\nNeighbors B: Have you thought about where you want to go next?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A taught the kid the special move to help them feel better, and Neighbors B agreed to buy candy for the neighborhood kids to spread happiness. Neighbors B then admired Neighbors A's organization skills and expressed a desire to enhance their own organization. In response, Neighbor A showed willingness to take precautions and make smart decisions. \n\nNeighbors A won against a kid in chess by using a special move, which led both Neighbors A and B to believe in the value of doing good deeds to strengthen the community. Neighbor B, concerned about safety, cautioned against connecting with strangers. \n\nBoth Neighbors A and B share a belief in the significance of learning and self-improvement, as well as the importance of performing acts of kindness to foster unity. Neighbor B recommended alternative ways to manage stress and emphasized the importance of Neighbor A's well-being.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm considering visiting Japan next. The culture there is fascinating, and I've always wanted to experience it firsthand.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information about the interactions between Neighbors A and B, focusing on their interest in strengthening the community, organization, performing acts of kindness, and safety concerns. However, the MEMORY does not provide direct relevance or context to the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Neighbor A's trip to South America. The sentences provide some background on the characters' personalities, such as organization skills and community values, but these details do not directly inform or enhance the dialogue about travel experiences. Additionally, the overall structure lacks a clear development or causality that connects to the conversation about South America, Machu Picchu, and future travel plans, making it less helpful in generating an appropriate next response."
