Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I have some exciting plans for the future that I wanted to share with you.\nClassmates B: Oh really? What are they?\nClassmates A: Well, I was thinking that we could work on a project together and maybe even become business partners.\nClassmates B: Wow, that sounds amazing! What kind of project are you thinking about?\nClassmates A: I was thinking about starting a marketing agency specialized in social media.\nClassmates B: That's a great idea! I'd love to work with you on that. We could really make a difference in the industry.\nClassmates A: Yes, exactly! And I think our skills complement each other's so well.\nClassmates B: I totally agree. You're so creative and outgoing, while I'm more analytical and detail-oriented.\nClassmates A: It's like we were meant to work together, right?\nClassmates B: Absolutely! I can't wait to see what the future holds for us.\nClassmates A: Me too. And honestly, it's a bit of a relief to finally have a solid plan for the future.\nClassmates B: Yeah, I get that. Speaking of the future, how have you been doing with your sleeping problems?\nClassmates A: It's been a slow process, but I've been making progress with it. I started doing yoga and meditation before bed, and that's been helping a lot.\nClassmates B: That's great to hear. And what about your past struggles with school and friendships? Do you feel like you've moved on from that?\nClassmates A: Definitely. It's been a journey, but I've worked hard to overcome those obstacles. And now I feel like I'm finally on the right path.\nClassmates B: I'm so proud of you,. You've come such a long way.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmate A encourages Classmate B to initiate conversations and be friendly to make new friends, which causes Classmates B to appreciate Classmates A's gesture of buying coffee. This leads to Classmates A agreeing to try the suggestion and thanking Classmates B for it. As a result, Classmates B wants Classmates A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n\nClassmates A and B enjoy singing karaoke together and look forward to future outings, expressing their want to meet for coffee again in the future. They are also looking forward to meeting up again after getting better sleep, which has changed to Classmate A expressing regret about their past academic performance.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you for always being there to support me through it all. I couldn't have done it without you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information about the relationship and past interactions between Classmates A and B, such as their discussions about personal growth, getting better sleep, and plans for future activities together. However, the connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT regarding the business partnership and personal development is not as strong as it could be. While the memory indicates that Classmate A has struggled with sleep and academics before and Classmate B supports them, it doesn't directly relate to the agency project or clearly outline the developmental progress Classmates A and B are experiencing, which could enhance the cohesiveness and help in generating a more contextually rich response. Moreover, the structure of the sentences does not clearly demonstrate the causality or development of events in a manner easily extractable for generating a response. Overall, it contains useful background details but could benefit from clearer contextual connections and development."
