    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I have some exciting plans for the future that I wanted to share with you.\nClassmates B: Oh really? What are they?\nClassmates A: Well, I was thinking that we could work on a project together and maybe even become business partners.\nClassmates B: Wow, that sounds amazing! What kind of project are you thinking about?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B admires Classmates A's outgoing nature and wants to be more like them. Classmates A appreciated the gesture of buying coffee and agreed to try the suggestion, thanking Classmates B for it. Classmates B encourages Classmates A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n\n2. Classmates A and B enjoy singing karaoke together and look forward to future outings. They are open to meeting for coffee again in the future, having shared memories of buying coffee from Starbucks and enjoying it together.\n\n3. Classmates A and B both enjoy socializing and going out to parties together. They are social and enjoy meeting new people. Classmates A considers talking to a therapist or counselor to address past issues.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provided offers some context about the relationship and interactions between Classmates A and B but lacks specific relevance to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Here's why:\n\n1. The memory does provide some general context about the relationship between A and B, such as B's admiration for A's outgoing nature (MEMORY 1), shared activities they enjoy like karaoke and coffee outings (MEMORY 2), and their social habits and meeting new people (MEMORY 3). This gives a sense of camaraderie and shared interests, which can be slightly helpful when considering the potential for collaboration on a project as mentioned in the dialogue context.\n\n2. However, the details mentioned are not directly related to the conversation at hand, which is about starting a project or potential business partnership. The MEMORY lacks specific information about previous discussions or brainstorming sessions on projects, business acumen, or shared professional interests which would be highly relevant.\n\n3. There is a lack of structured connection or development related to project planning or cooperation that would genuinely aid in generating an informative response closely aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nThe MEMORY has some naturally phrased sentences that offer an overview of the relationship, but they don't strongly connect to the specific idea of planning a future project or business partnership. Hence, it provides moderate assistance to a language model in generating a fluent and contextually appropriate response."
