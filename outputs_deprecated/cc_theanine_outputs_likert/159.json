    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today.\nClassmates B:  That sounds great. What was the talk about?\nClassmates A: It was about the history of the pyramids in Egypt. I learned so much about their construction and the cultural significance they held.\nClassmates B: Wow, that does sound interesting. Did you take any notes?\nClassmates A: Yes, I took lots of notes. I'm excited to study this topic more on my own time.\nClassmates B: That's awesome. It's great to see your enthusiasm for learning.\nClassmates A: Thanks. I've always been passionate about learning new things. Remember when we talked about how determined I was to get into college?\nClassmates B: Yeah, I remember. You were always studying and taking extra classes.\nClassmates A: And now, after all that hard work, I am actually in college. It just goes to show that with dedication, you can achieve your goals.\nClassmates B: That's so inspiring. It also reminds me of when you wore your pajamas to school. You were always doing something different and unique.\nClassmates A: Haha, yeah, I remember that. But hey, being a little weird sometimes adds some fun and excitement to life. Speaking of exciting things, I met the girl of my dreams a couple of years ago at a party.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Classmates A had a moment of frustration in the past but has learned to channel that energy into studies, which caused them to show up to school in pajamas due to oversleeping after studying late.\n- Classmates A met the girl of their dreams at a party and have been texting her nonstop, which made them take off their belt and dislike wearing it all day.\n- Classmates A is dedicated to studying hard and taking extra classes to get into a good college, wanting to work hard to achieve their dreams, and not being afraid to be themselves and embracing their quirks, which their girlfriend appreciates.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Classmates B",
    "raw_prediction": "Oh, really? That's great to hear. How did you two meet at the party?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains relevant information that aligns well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It supports the context by highlighting Classmates A's dedication to studying, their passion for learning, and their unique personality traits, such as wearing pajamas to school due to studying late. These points are naturally connected and demonstrate the development and consistency in Classmates A's character. Additionally, the mention of Classmates A meeting the girl of his dreams ties in with the dialogue's mention of exciting events. Though the part about disliking wearing a belt is not directly relevant, the overall memory still offers valuable context for generating the next response."
