Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I can't believe I got caught cheating on my taxes. This is such a mess.\nClassmates B: Wait, what? You cheated on your taxes? That's not okay.\nClassmates A: I know, I know. I was just really struggling financially and I thought I could get away with it.\nClassmates B: You can't just cheat and hope to never get caught. That's not how it works.\nClassmates A: Remember when we talked about me wanting to become a professional basketball player?\n\nMEMORY:\n- Classmates A has a big dream of becoming a professional basketball player and works hard towards that goal.\n- Classmates A started working at the grocery store last week and is enjoying the experience, learning about running a store.\n- Classmate A is pursuing a dream of becoming a professional basketball player and is working at a grocery store to save up money for training.\n- Classmates A believes in hard work and dedication to achieve goals both in basketball and their job.\n- Both classmates have a positive attitude towards each other and their respective goals.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, I remember. It's a tough journey, but you always said you believe in hard work and dedication to reach your goals.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information about Classmate A's dream of becoming a professional basketball player, which is directly mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This connection can help Classmate B understand Classmate A's priorities and motivations. However, most of the MEMORY is not directly related to the conversation about cheating on taxes. The information about working at a grocery store and learning about running a store, while related to Classmate A's financial struggles, isn't clearly connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT or cheating on taxes. Additionally, the abstraction about positive attitudes doesn't provide substantial aid in generating a response related to the core conversation. The sentences are not deeply connected to the immediate context about the tax issue, leading to the low score, since they don't provide critical support for understanding or advancing the discussion meaningfully."
