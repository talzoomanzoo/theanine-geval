Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm really excited about finding a buyer for my product. I think it has a lot of potential.\nNeighbors B: That's great to hear, what kind of product is it?\nNeighbors A: It's a new type of workout equipment that's designed to be more efficient than traditional equipment. I've been working on it for months now and I really think it's going to take off.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A is working on improving themselves and Neighbors B is supportive of their efforts. Neighbors B advised Neighbors A to change their behavior at work, causing Neighbors A to strive to be a better colleague. Neighbors B wants Neighbors A to succeed and treats others with respect, while Neighbors A reassured Neighbors B about the dog's disappearance.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful context relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, as it mentions that Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's efforts and wants them to succeed. This shows a supportive relationship which may influence the conversation about selling the product. However, other details like changing behavior at work and the mention of a dog's disappearance do not directly relate to the current dialogue about the product. While these details provide a broader understanding of the neighbors' dynamic, they do not directly aid in formulating a next response about the workout equipment. The phrasing in MEMORY is generally clear and could allow a language model to distinguish between relevant and less relevant information, hence a middle score of 3."
