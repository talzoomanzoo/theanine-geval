Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something.\nClassmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\nClassmates A: Well, it’s been on my mind for a while now and I couldn’t shake it off. I just can't stop thinking about you.\nClassmates B: Oh, really?\nClassmates A: Yes, really. I know we've been friends for a while now, but I feel like there may be something more between us.\nClassmates B: Hmm, I never thought about it that way. But I can’t deny that we have a great connection.\nClassmates A: Exactly! I just feel like we could be more than just friends. If it's something you're open to, of course.\nClassmates B: I get what you’re saying,. And to be honest, I’ve had similar thoughts lately. I’m definitely open to exploring this.\nClassmates A: I’m so relieved to hear that. I was worried that I might be crossing a line by expressing my feelings.\nClassmates B: No, not at all. I’m glad you did. It takes courage to express your true feelings. \nClassmates A: Yeah, I guess it does. It’s just that I’ve been hurt before, and I don’t want to lose you as a friend too.\nClassmates B: I understand your concerns,. but I think we can make this work. We've already built a strong foundation of friendship, which is important for any relationship.\nClassmates A: That’s true. I feel like we can take this in any direction that we want.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates A had doubts about trusting Classmates B due to rumors about their reliability, but then Classmates A offered help and support to Classmates B. This was supported by a moment where Classmate A admired Classmate B's courage and strength in sharing a secret, showing their supportive and compassionate nature.\n\nWhile working on a group project together, Classmates A and B have shown to be supportive friends who look out for each other during stressful times. They have also built a level of trust between them, with Classmate A valuing setting high standards and being hesitant to lower them. Moreover, both classmates believe in striving to be the best version of themselves while also being kind and compassionate towards themselves and others.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I agree, we have a solid foundation to build upon. Let's see where this takes us.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The memory provided generally aligns well with the dialogue context and offers useful background information on the relationship between Classmates A and B. It highlights past interactions where Classmate A expressed doubts about trusting Classmate B due to rumors, yet offered support—aligning with Classmate A's concerns in the dialogue about being hurt in the past and the importance of trust. The memory further describes their supportive friendship developed through a group project, emphasizing themes of trust and support, which relate to the dialogue's topic of exploring a deeper relationship. However, while the sentences in the memory are naturally connected and provide valuable insight, not all details directly inform the dialogue context. For example, specific mentions of high standards or beliefs may not directly influence the current conversation, though they complement the overall understanding of their connection."
