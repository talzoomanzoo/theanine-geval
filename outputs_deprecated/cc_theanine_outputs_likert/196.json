Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager!\nCo-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge.\nCo-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail.\nCo-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Co-worker A has fantasies of being a great leader, which leads to Co-worker A being focused on getting along and working smoothly with Co-worker B. This is acknowledged and supported by Co-worker B, who advises Co-worker A to take small steps and have one conversation at a time.\n- Co-worker B encourages Co-worker A to consider pursuing a leadership position and highlights the qualities of a good leader. This drives Co-worker A to have aspirations of being a great leader and emphasize the importance of communication. Over the years, Co-worker A has grown and become more confident, although at one point feeling embarrassed for losing control of their emotions.\n- Co-worker B encourages Co-worker A to consider pursuing a leadership position and highlights the qualities of a good leader. As a result, Co-worker A is focused on getting along and working smoothly with Co-worker B, who acknowledges and supports Co-worker A's growth and progress, advising them to take small steps and have one conversation at a time.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides valuable background information that richly supplements the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It explains the previous encouragement from Co-worker B to Co-worker A regarding leadership roles, which coherently connects with Co-worker A’s recent promotion. This helps in understanding the context of their conversation, as it highlights Co-worker B’s influence on Co-worker A’s professional development. The MEMORY shows the development of Co-worker A’s confidence over time and aligns with Co-worker B’s supportive comments in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The repetition of certain sentences in the MEMORY slightly affects its clarity, hence not a perfect score. However, it efficiently contextualizes their past interactions, making it mostly helpful for a language model to generate a well-informed next response."
