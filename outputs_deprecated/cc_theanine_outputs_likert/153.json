Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today.\nClassmates B:  That sounds great. What was the talk about?\nClassmates A: It was about the history of the pyramids in Egypt. I learned so much about their construction and the cultural significance they held.\nClassmates B: Wow, that does sound interesting. Did you take any notes?\nClassmates A: Yes, I took lots of notes. I'm excited to study this topic more on my own time.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates B is interested in attending a new technology conference next month. Classmates B noticed Classmates A's improvement and acknowledged their hard work. Classmates B is supportive of Classmates A's new relationship and believes they found someone who makes them happy.\nClassmates B is working on finishing a history project. Classmates A is dedicated to studying hard and taking extra classes to get into a good college. Classmates B advises Classmates A to consider how others perceive them, especially in situations like applying to college. \nClassmates A is willing to work hard to achieve their dreams. Classmates A met the girl of their dreams at a party and have been texting her nonstop.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's awesome! It's great that you're diving deeper into the subject. Any plans on how you'll continue to explore it further?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information that is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it mentions that Classmates B is working on a history project, which relates to Classmates A's interest in the history of the pyramids. However, the MEMORY lacks direct relevance or natural connection to the specific DIALOGUE CONTEXT about pyramids in Egypt. Other parts of the MEMORY, such as Classmates B's interest in a new technology conference, their supportive nature, and Classmates A's relationship, do not contribute much to generating a proper next response and do not relate to the current topic of discussion. The memories are not phrased in a way that demonstrates clear development or causality connected to the dialogue, which makes it less helpful. Nonetheless, they are naturally structured and provide some contextual cues that can be useful in different situations."
