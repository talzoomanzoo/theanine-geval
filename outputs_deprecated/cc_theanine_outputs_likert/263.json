Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Wife, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today.\nWife: That's lovely! I always feel so cozy and comfortable when you do that.\nHusband: I know, and I love making the apartment feel like a warm and welcoming space for you.\n\nMEMORY:\nThe husband feels supported by his wife in pursuing activities that make him happy outside of work and family life. This makes the wife glad that the husband has a friend he can trust and enjoy spending time with, and she is supportive of her husband's faith journey. The husband values the supportive community of believers at church and appreciates having his wife by his side.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It really does make a difference. I appreciate all the effort you put into making our home feel so inviting.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY briefly captures the supportive dynamic between the husband and wife, which is relevant to the dialogue context where they express happiness in creating a cozy home. However, the focus on the husband's faith journey and broader support from his wife does not naturally connect to the specific dialogue about decorating with lights and candles. The sentences are structured to show a generally supportive relationship, providing some contextual understanding, yet more direct connections to the current topic of a cozy home environment would enhance helpfulness."
