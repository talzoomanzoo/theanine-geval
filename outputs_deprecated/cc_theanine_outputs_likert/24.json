    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit.\nNeighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water.\nNeighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A and B, who have known each other for years, plan to hang out once a week, possibly watching a movie, getting coffee, or just talking. They are on friendly terms and enjoy spending time together. Neighbor B is comforting and supportive towards Neighbor A. They reminisce about past events and cherish their friendship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides some context for the overall relationship and interactions between Neighbors A and B, but lacks specific information that directly connects to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY helps set the stage by indicating that the neighbors have a friendship and enjoy spending time together, which aligns with the playful and informal nature of pushing someone into the water mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the MEMORY doesn't contain detailed past interactions or specific incidents that could help in generating a nuanced response to the current conflict about the water-pushing incident. \n\nMoreover, while the MEMORY is naturally phrased and indicates a general understanding of their relationship, it doesn't provide much about past conflicts or resolutions that would be valuable for addressing the current situation where Neighbor B is upset. Thus, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful but could be improved to better inform the dialogue generation concerning the immediate interaction in the context."
