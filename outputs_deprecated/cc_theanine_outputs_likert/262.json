Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Husband, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today.\nWife: That's lovely! I always feel so cozy and comfortable when you do that.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The husband had a good time hanging out with his friend, feeling happy and content with their company.\n2. The husband enjoys being outside and loves the weather after being stuck indoors at work.\n3. Both the husband and wife agree that it's the little things that add up and make life meaningful.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Sentence 3, \"Both the husband and wife agree that it's the little things that add up and make life meaningful,\" connects well with the wife's appreciation of the cozy environment created by the husband. This suggests a shared value in appreciating small gestures, which is relevant to the conversation. However, sentences 1 and 2, while naturally phrased, do not directly contribute to the current dialogue context. They provide background on the husband's personal interests and recent activities but do not aid in generating a response to the wife's comment about the lights and candles. The overall natural phrasing and the partial relevance to the context result in a score of 3."
