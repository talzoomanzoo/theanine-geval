Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey, can you keep a secret?\nNeighbors B: Of course, what's up?\nNeighbors A: I can't be seen because I am hiding from my mom behind the door.\nNeighbors B: Oh, why are you hiding from her?\nNeighbors A: She wants me to go to a family dinner tonight, but I'm too tired and just want to relax at home.\nNeighbors B: Maybe you should talk to her about it and let her know how you feel.\nNeighbors A: I know, but I don't want to disappoint her.\nNeighbors B: It's important to take care of your own needs and speak up for yourself. Plus, maybe you can compromise and go to the dinner for a little while and then come back home to relax.\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, thanks for the advice.\nNeighbors B: No problem. Speaking of compromise, remember that dinner we went to a few days ago?\nNeighbors A: Yes, it was so much fun!\nNeighbors B: I'm glad you enjoyed it. Maybe we can make it a regular thing and try out new restaurants together.\nNeighbors A: That sounds great! And it gives me something to look forward to after work.\nNeighbors B: Speaking of work, how are you feeling about your job lately?\nNeighbors A: Honestly, still a bit unfulfilled. But I've been thinking about exploring some new opportunities and seeing what else is out there.\nNeighbors B: That's a good plan. It's important to pursue what makes you happy and fulfilled.\nNeighbors A: Definitely. Thanks for being such a great listener and always giving me good advice.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors B is interested in Neighbors A's cooking and asks about the vegetables and quinoa preparation. This leads to Neighbors A and B joking about the fun aspects of using telekinesis to surprise people. Neighbors B reacts with excitement and support towards Neighbor A's new ability, expressing a desire to plan a dinner to celebrate their adventures in learning.\nNeighbors B is open to trying new recipes and is thrilled to receive the chickpea curry recipe from Neighbors A. This conversation transitions into Neighbors A and B discussing the idea of having telekinetic abilities. As a result, Neighbor A feels overwhelmed yet excited about their newfound ability. This then contrasts with Neighbor A's feelings of stagnation and lack of growth in their current job.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm always here for you, happy to offer support and help you navigate through any decisions you need to make. Just remember to prioritize your own happiness and well-being.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some related themes to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as discussions about cooking and trying new things, which reflect ongoing and dynamic interactions between the neighbors. However, the content about telekinesis and feelings of excitement about new abilities is somewhat disconnected from the context provided where the focus is on issues like family obligations and job satisfaction. The dialogue mainly revolves around personal feelings about familial expectations, work, and hobbies, while the memory introduces fantastical elements (telekinesis) that were not present in the direct context. This disconnect diminishes its helpfulness in generating a relevant response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, there is a lack of direct relevance or causality linking the memories to the current conversation flow, which restricts the utility of the memory in informing the continuation of the dialogue."
