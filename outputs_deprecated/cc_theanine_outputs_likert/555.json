Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, how are you feeling today?\nClassmates B: I'm feeling frustrated. I wish I could do things on my own.\nClassmates A: I understand how you feel. It can be tough when you feel like you're dependent on others.\nClassmates B: Yeah, exactly. I don't want to be a burden on anyone.\nClassmates A: You're not a burden, don't worry. And I'm always here to help you out.\nClassmates B: I appreciate that, but I don't want to always rely on others. I want to be more independent.\nClassmates A: I get it. Maybe there are some small things you can do on your own to start feeling more independent?\nClassmates B: Like what?\nClassmates A: Well, maybe you can start by making a list of things you'd like to do on your own and we can work on achieving those goals together.\nClassmates B: That sounds like a good idea. Thanks for understanding, Classmates A.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Classmates A and B, with a friendly and supportive relationship, are both keeping up with the homework in their math class.\n- Classmates A, who plays the guitar, takes lessons, and plays in a band, enjoys reminiscing about childhood memories, particularly about playing on swings and making music with friends.\n- After a conversation about following dreams, Classmates A finds it awesome that Classmates B is pursuing their passion for music. This leads to them enjoying jamming together and planning to collaborate on music in the future.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Of course, we can definitely work on that together. Just let me know how I can support you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about the relationship between Classmates A and B, particularly highlighting their shared interests in music and their supportive relationship. However, this information is not highly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where the focus is on Classmate B's feelings of frustration and desire for independence. The MEMORY does not provide specific insights that could aid in developing the current conversation. It lacks details or past interactions that involve Classmate B's desire for independence or relevant experiences that could be helpful in generating a more contextually appropriate response. The connection between their shared experiences in music and their current conversation is not clearly established, making the MEMORY only slightly helpful in understanding the current dynamics of their interaction."
