Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just tried this breathing exercise and it really helped me relax.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A felt their relationship with Neighbors B was improving after trying a breathing exercise. Neighbor B reassured Neighbor A about past embarrassing incidents, strengthening their friendship. Neighbor A surprised Neighbor B with a pizza, leading to both neighbors looking forward to new adventures and discoveries together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! Breathing exercises can be so beneficial for relaxation.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model to generate a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It clearly outlines the past interactions between Neighbors A and B, such as the relationship improvement after the breathing exercise, the reassurance about past embarrassing incidents, and the shared excitement for future adventures. These interactions are naturally connected and indicate a developing friendship, which supports the context of Neighbor A feeling relaxed and potentially leading to a further positive interaction. Although not every sentence is directly related to the breathing exercise mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, they collectively help in understanding the nature of Neighbors A's and B's relationship, making them useful for generating further dialogue."
