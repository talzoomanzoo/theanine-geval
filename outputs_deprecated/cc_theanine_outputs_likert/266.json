Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Husband, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today.\nWife: That's lovely! I always feel so cozy and comfortable when you do that.\nHusband: I know, and I love making the apartment feel like a warm and welcoming space for you.\nWife: You always go above and beyond, dear.\nHusband: It's the little things that count, right?\nWife: Definitely. Speaking of little things, do you remember when you told me about catching the bus just in time a few months ago?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The husband finds joy in the little things, like catching the bus on time, which the wife recalls him mentioning a couple of years ago.\n2. Both the husband and wife agree that life's meaning comes from appreciating the small things, such as playing the guitar, a hobby the wife supports.\n3. The husband values his wife's support in his hobbies and is grateful for having a friend he can trust, while the wife is happy to see him happy.\n4. The husband cherishes the supportive community at church and is thankful for his wife's presence, as they both find purpose and happiness together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I remember that! It's those small victories that can really brighten up the day.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights the husband's appreciation for the little things in life, which directly ties into the current context of discussing small acts like hanging up lights and candles. It also notes the wife's support in various aspects of life, reinforcing the supportive dynamics between the couple present in the dialogue. Moreover, the MEMORY touches on shared values and experiences, such as appreciating the small things and the importance of a supportive community, though not directly related, do hint at the nature of their relationship, which can be useful when considering responses. However, the mention of playing the guitar and the church community is somewhat tangential and less connected to the immediate context, otherwise it would have warranted a perfect score."
