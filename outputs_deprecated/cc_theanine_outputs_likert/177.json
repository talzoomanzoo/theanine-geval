Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Parent, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: Child, I have a new project that I've been working on.\nChild: What is it, Parent?\nParent: I created a website where I post advertisements, and people can pay to see them.\nChild: Oh, that's interesting. How does it work?\nParent: Well, I create the ads myself, and then I post them on my website. People who want to view the ads can pay a small fee, and then they can see them.\nChild: Do you think people will pay to see your ads?\nParent: I don't know yet, but I hope so. I've put a lot of effort into creating some eye-catching ads.\nChild: That sounds cool, but why do you want to make money from ads?\n\nMEMORY:\nThe child feels it is unfair that they have to do certain chores because the Parent is too tired. The Parent acknowledges being lazy about washing dishes and promises to contribute more to keeping the home clean. The child expresses gratitude for being adopted by the parent and believes other children will be lucky to have them as a parent. The Child supports the idea of the Parent adopting more children and hopes for a happy home for them.\n\nThe Child suggests creating a schedule for chores to ensure everyone contributes equally. The Parent expresses a desire to be a better role model for the Child and their siblings. The parent and child have open communication about various topics, including a past accident and the parent's willingness to contribute more to household chores. The Parent has seen a doctor and is taking medicine for their illness.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY does not provide helpful information for generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY focuses on themes of household chores, fairness, family dynamics, and adoption, none of which are relevant or connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT regarding the Parent's new project of a website for paid advertisements. There is no indication of the development or causality that would guide the language model in generating a response about the business or advertising context being discussed. The MEMORY lacks the necessary information to support a meaningful continuation of the current conversation."
