Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just visited this amazing new city. The architecture was stunning, the streets were so clean, and the people were very friendly.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like you had a great time! Which city did you visit?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A has been living in the same place for a long time and enjoys the neighborhood and people there. Despite this, Neighbors A values the relationship with Neighbors B and considers them like family. As a result, Neighbors A is excited to explore the neighborhood and make new friends. \n\nNeighbor A has been living in the same place for a long time and enjoys the neighborhood and people there. Neighbors A enjoys living in the neighborhood, feeling comfortable and safe, and has made good friends, including Neighbors B. This leads to Neighbors A valuing the relationship with Neighbors B and considering them like family. Consequently, Neighbors B acknowledges Neighbors A's friendly and outgoing nature. \n\nNeighbor B has moved around a lot over the years but is considering settling down in the current neighborhood. This prompts Neighbors A to enjoy living in the neighborhood, feeling comfortable and safe, and has made good friends, including Neighbors B. Neighbors A values the relationship with Neighbors B and considers them like family, which in turn leads to Neighbors A appreciating having friendly faces around and hoping to make new friends soon.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some information about the relationship and interactions between Neighbors A and B, such as Neighbors A considering Neighbors B like family and both valuing their relationship. However, it lacks direct relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is focused on Neighbor A's recent visit to a new city and the conversation about it. The MEMORY repetitively emphasizes the comfort, safety, and friendships in the neighborhood without offering any meaningful development or progression of events that could assist in generating an appropriate response to the current conversation about the city visit. As such, while the memory contains naturally structured sentences, they don't significantly contribute or provide helpful information for understanding or advancing the dialogue context."
