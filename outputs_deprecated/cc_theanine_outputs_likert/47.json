    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\nCo-workers A: But I love her and I don't want her to be with anyone else. It's the only way.\nCo-workers B: That's not love, Co-workers A. Love is about respecting someone's choices and feelings. You can't just kidnap someone and force them to be with you.\nCo-workers A: I know, but I can't help how I feel. It's like when I borrowed your pencil without asking. I felt guilty, but I couldn't resist using it.\nCo-workers B: That's not the same thing, Co-workers A. Stealing someone and keeping them against their will is illegal and immoral. You need to let go of this obsession and move on.\nCo-workers A: I know you're right, Co-workers B. I just don't know how to get over this feeling.\nCo-workers B: Maybe try talking to someone about it. A therapist or a trusted friend. They can help you work through these emotions in a healthy way.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B's willingness to help others was evident when they assisted a customer last week. This trait was further highlighted when Co-worker A borrowed a pencil without asking and felt guilty about it. \nAfter Co-worker A spoke with the police about the incident, the women involved were thankful. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\nReflecting on Co-worker B's past actions, Co-worker A is remembered for their bravery and strength in various situations. Co-worker B admires Co-worker A's resilience and positivity, noting their ability to stay optimistic even in challenging circumstances, such as the accident where they lost their hands and feet.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some elements relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the mention of a pencil being borrowed without asking, which relates directly to the dialogue. However, the rest of the MEMORY consists of unrelated information about Co-worker B's traits and Co-worker A's past experiences, such as the incident with the police and losing their hands and feet, which do not contribute to the current dialogue situation. The information about Co-worker B's willingness to help and Co-worker A's bravery and positivity, while naturally phrased, are not connected in a way to aid in generating a proper next response in the ongoing conversation about Co-worker A's feelings and actions regarding the bride. The memory lacks clear development, causality, or relevance to the dialogue context."
