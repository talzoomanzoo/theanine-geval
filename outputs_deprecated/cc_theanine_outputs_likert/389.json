Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Husband, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway?\nWife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go?\nHusband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city.\nWife: Oh, that sounds like a perfect idea! It will be nice to have some peace and quiet for a change.\nHusband: Yes, and we could cook our meals together, go for a hike, and just relax. What do you think?\nWife: That sounds lovely, husband. I'm really looking forward to it.\nHusband: Great. I'll start looking for rental cabins right away. I know this may sound impulsive, but I'm really excited to make this happen.\nWife: Don't worry, husband, it's not impulsive. You always follow through with your plans, and I believe this will be a wonderful experience for both of us.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The wife's support and pride in her husband working towards his goals inspires him to take action on his dreams.\n2. The husband's drive to achieve his dreams and effort in making them a reality makes him excited about his progress and committed to a future with his wife.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, indicating the wife's support and the husband's drive, which are helpful for a language model to generate contextually appropriate responses. However, the MEMORY is relatively abstract and could benefit from additional concrete details or examples related to past interactions that directly relate to the dialogue. The sentences provide a general sense of development but lack specific connections or events that would offer more helpful context for generating responses."
