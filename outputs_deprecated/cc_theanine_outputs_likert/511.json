Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I know you know something about my past. Can you tell me what it is?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A believes in the power of positivity and its impact on life. This belief led Classmates A to feel nervous about fitting in but saw Classmates B as well-liked and wanted to be friends with them. This encounter made Classmates A curious about exploring new things and taking risks.\n2. Classmates A doesn't have their own car yet and takes the bus. Due to this, Classmates B warned Classmates A about the potential danger of dark alleys.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided includes two pieces of information that could potentially be helpful in generating a response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The first memory note indicates that Classmates A is curious and open to exploring new things, which could relate to why they want to know about their past. The second note gives a practical detail about Classmates A not having a car and being warned about dark alleys, hinting at a protective nature from Classmates B. Both pieces of information show past interactions and perspectives that could influence the current conversation. However, they don't directly address Classmates A's question about the past, and the connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is somewhat vague. Thus, the score is in the middle range."
