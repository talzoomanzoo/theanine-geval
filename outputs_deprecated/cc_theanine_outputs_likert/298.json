    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I marked the boundary line with a pen on the wall so that we can both be clear about where my property ends and your property begins.\nNeighbors B: Oh, okay. I didn't realize there was any confusion about that.\nNeighbors A: Well, I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page. I don't want any misunderstandings in the future.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A and Neighbor B both enjoy reading and sharing books, emphasizing the importance of taking care of each other as neighbors.\nNeighbor B feels inspired by Neighbor A's reading and offers to be more supportive, checking in on Neighbor A more often.\nNeighbor A and Neighbor B reminisce about a past concert they attended together and express a desire to strengthen their relationship. \nAfter being promoted to manager, Neighbor A has a new workout routine, waking up at 5 a.m to relieve stress, but struggles to maintain consistency.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information about the relationship between Neighbor A and Neighbor B, indicating shared interests such as reading and a past event they attended together. It implies that they have a friendly relationship and are interested in maintaining and even strengthening it. However, this MEMORY does not directly address the current issue of property lines being discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While the information about their relationship might be contextually useful for generating a soft and understanding tone in Neighbor B's response, it doesn't directly contribute to resolving the boundary line conversation. Thus, it is moderately helpful but lacks direct relevance."
