Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: It's great to have friends who can help each other out, isn't it?\nNeighbors B: Absolutely. It's a two-way street, and it's important to be there for each other.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors B emphasized the importance of apologizing to show care for the relationship.\nNeighbors A bought a necklace from Neighbors B's shop and loves it.\nNeighbors A got a necklace with a blue stone that matches well with work clothes after Neighbors B's suggestion.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Definitely, that's what makes relationships strong and meaningful.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT in suggesting a history of transactions and advice between the two neighbors, particularly through Neighbors A buying a necklace with Neighbors B's suggestion. This indicates a supportive relationship that can align with the theme of friendship and mutual aid in the current conversation. However, the relevance of the apology emphasis is less clear in the given context and may not directly aid in generating a response for the current dialogue. The connection between specific past events and behavior, while present, could be clearer and more robustly interconnected to enhance its usefulness. Overall, MEMORY provides some context for mutual support but not with the strongest clarity or relevance ties to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
