Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Why is your face so red and splotchy, Classmates B? Did you get sunburned?\nClassmates B: No, I didn't get sunburned. I'm just feeling a bit embarrassed.\nClassmates A: Embarrassed? Why?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A helped Classmates B prepare for a driving test, showing patience and dedication. This act is admired by Classmate B, who sees it as a good example for others.\n2. Classmates A values striving for excellence, taking pride in their work, and producing high-quality results. This leads them to believe in giving 110% effort in everything they do.\n3. Feeling lightheaded and running out of oxygen while stranded in space, Classmate A pushes themselves to do better to improve their skills and learn something new. This emphasizes the importance of hard work and dedication in skill improvement.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a small amount of useful context concerning Classmates A and B's past interactions. Both classmates are described in a way that positions Classmates A as someone dedicated and supportive, offering clues about their attitude towards Classmates B. However, the sentences lack direct relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY does not clarify why Classmates B might feel embarrassed or offer any past interaction that would suggest a cause for embarrassment. The content about striving for excellence and being stranded in space seems unrelated and detracts from the potential relevance to the dialogue. Although not completely disconnected, the MEMORY fails to offer adequately helpful insights into the current conversation's context."
