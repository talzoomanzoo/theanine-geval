    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Mentor, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Mentor has been guiding and supporting the Mentee in their work for years, resulting in the Mentee expressing gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process. This has led to the Mentee feeling overwhelmed with the college application process, similar to how they took shoes from the store without paying because they couldn't afford them.\n\n2. The Mentor has been guiding and supporting the Mentee in their work for years, which prompted the Mentor to reassure the Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace. \n\n3. The Mentor has been guiding and supporting the Mentee in their work for years, ultimately causing the Mentee to be offered a job and decide to take the job in the city.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's completely normal to feel that way when you're in a new place. Building a new support system takes time, but you'll find your rhythm. Just remember, you're not alone in this transition.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context regarding the Mentor's long-term support for the Mentee, which could be useful for understanding their relationship. However, the specific details mentioned, such as the college application process, shoes incident, and job offer, do not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where the Mentee is expressing loneliness in a new city. There is a lack of relevant information about social situations, coping with loneliness, or forming new connections that would be more helpful for generating a supportive response to the Mentee's current concern. Furthermore, the sentences do not clearly demonstrate a coherent development or causality that connects directly to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Thus, the helpfulness of the provided MEMORY is limited."
