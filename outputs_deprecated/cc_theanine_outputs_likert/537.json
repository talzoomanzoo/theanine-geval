    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, check out this spot I found to camp out for the night. It's perfect!\n\nMEMORY:\n- Classmate B previously discussed allergies with Classmate A a few years ago, which caused them to attend a party together.\n- Classmate A, actively involved in an action committee focused on improving the community, expresses a desire to find alternative ways to have fun and make a positive impact in the community. As a result, they agree to take better care of themselves in the future.\n- Classmates B finds Classmates A's involvement in the community admirable and important, reacting positively to Classmate A's participation in an action committee in high school to improve the community.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's awesome! It looks like a great place to relax and unwind. When are you thinking of going?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some background information about Classmate A's involvement in community activities and Classmate B's admiration of that, which could potentially influence how Classmate B might respond to Classmate A's discovery of a campsite. However, this information does not directly relate to the current context of camping out for the night. The past discussion of allergies leading to a party does not contribute helpfully to generating a next response regarding the campsite. Overall, the MEMORY contains some structured sentences about their past interactions, but these are not clearly relevant to the immediate camping context. Therefore, the MEMORY is somewhat limited in its helpfulness for generating a proper next response based on the provided DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
