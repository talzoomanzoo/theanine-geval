Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just visited this amazing new city. The architecture was stunning, the streets were so clean, and the people were very friendly.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like you had a great time! Which city did you visit?\nNeighbors A: It was Chicago. I had never been before, but it exceeded all my expectations.\nNeighbors B: I bet it was a nice change of scenery from our neighborhood.\nNeighbors A: Definitely. But you know, it's interesting how much our neighborhood has grown on me over the years. I remember when I first moved here, I was so unsure about it.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor B has moved around a lot over the years but is considering settling down in the current neighborhood. This is similar to Neighbors A enjoying living in the neighborhood, feeling comfortable and safe, and having made good friends, including Neighbor B. It's also like Neighbors A valuing the relationship with Neighbor B and considering them like family. Additionally, Neighbors A is excited to explore the neighborhood and make new friends.\n\nNeighbor A and Neighbor B appreciate each other as good neighbors and have organized a block party together in the past. This relates to Neighbors A enjoying living in the neighborhood, feeling comfortable and safe, and having made good friends, including Neighbor B. They also both live in the same place and find comfort in it. Moreover, Neighbors A found a park and a coffee shop nearby that they want to visit.\n\nNeighbor A has been living in the same place for a long time and enjoys the neighborhood and people there. This aligns with Neighbors A enjoying living in the neighborhood, feeling comfortable and safe, and having made good friends, including Neighbor B. It's also similar to Neighbors A used to have power over Neighbor B, but no longer has it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I know what you mean. It's funny how things change over time. But I'm glad to hear that you've come to appreciate our neighborhood more.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains helpful information that could assist a language model in generating a relevant next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY highlights the similarities between Neighbor A and Neighbor B in terms of enjoying the neighborhood, feeling comfortable, safe, and having made good friends, including each other. Additionally, it mentions shared experiences, such as organizing a block party and having places within the neighborhood they enjoy visiting. These elements help establish the rapport and shared experiences between the neighbors, aligning well with the context of Neighborhood A finding the neighborhood growing on them over the years.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY contains some redundant phrasing and information that does not add much value or are repetitive, such as Neighbor A already mentioning enjoyment and comfort in the neighborhood multiple times. While the MEMORY is generally well-structured, consolidating similar ideas could help better clarity and provide more direct cues for generating replies related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This is why a score of 4, rather than 5, is more appropriate."
