Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I can't believe how honored I am to be part of our class. I feel like we have something special going on here.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate A confesses their love to Classmate B, who does not feel the same way. This leads to Classmate B appreciating Classmate A's honesty but not returning the romantic feelings.\n2. Classmate B plans to check their schedule to go to the mall with Classmate A. This results in Classmate B feeling relieved that they can still be friends with Classmate A despite the romantic confession.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains relevant information about the relationship and interactions between Classmate A and Classmate B. The first sentence gives us significant insight into their dynamic, highlighting a past romantic confession from Classmate A and Classmate B's reaction to it. This information is helpful for understanding the development of their relationship, especially given the positive sentiment expressed by Classmate A in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The second sentence introduces an event where Classmate B plans to maintain a friendship with Classmate A by checking their schedule to go to the mall, which aligns with the theme of appreciation and camaraderie mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY is structured to show causality and relational development, aiding a language model in generating an appropriate response to Classmate A's expression of being \"honored\" and recognizing the special nature of their class. However, it could potentially score higher if it included additional scenarios or interactions that further support this special bond sentiment."
