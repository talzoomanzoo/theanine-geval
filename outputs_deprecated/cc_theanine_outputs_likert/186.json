Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, have you checked out my new blog? It's all about promoting under-the-radar artists.\nClassmates B: I haven't had a chance to yet, but that sounds really cool! What inspired you to start it?\nClassmates A: Well, I've always had a passion for the arts, but I was too afraid to pursue it. I finally realized that it's what I really love, and I wanted to share that love with others.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Classmates A ended up taking Classmates B's advice and found success with it, which led to them valuing living life on their own terms and being content with their choices.\n- Classmate A values independence and focuses on their own happiness, as they have been pursuing their passions and enjoying life.\n- Classmates B is supportive and willing to offer help in the future, supporting Classmates A's perspective on living authentically and free from others' opinions.\n- Classmates B encouraged Classmates A to step out of their comfort zone and try new things for personal growth, which resonates with Classmate A's values of independence and happiness.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response in the context of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It outlines the supportive dynamic between Classmates A and B, highlighting how Classmates B has encouraged Classmates A to step out of their comfort zone and pursue their passions. This is relevant to Classmates A's decision to start a blog about promoting under-the-radar artists, as it is aligned with their values of independence and happiness. Additionally, the MEMORY provides context that Classmates B has been supportive in the past and is willing to help in the future, which can be useful for generating an authentic and supportive response from Classmates B. Overall, the MEMORY contains naturally connected sentences that clearly demonstrate the development of past interactions, providing important contextual cues related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, one piece of information—that Classmates A values their independence and focuses on their own happiness—was slightly repetitive as it was conveyed in two separate sentences. This could have been communicated more concisely. Consequently, I have rated it a 4 instead of a 5."
