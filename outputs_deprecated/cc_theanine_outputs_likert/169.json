Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Mentor, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Thank you for finding my glasses for me, Mentor. I always seem to misplace them.\nMentor: Not a problem, Mentee. I'm glad I could help. \nMentee: This actually reminds me of when I was struggling with substance abuse. I would often lose things or forget where I put things because of my drinking. It's amazing how much clearer my mind is now that I'm sober.\nMentor: That's a great observation, Mentee. Sobriety can definitely improve your cognitive abilities and overall wellbeing. It's amazing how much substance abuse can hold us back in life.\nMentee: Yeah, it's definitely a difficult journey, but I'm grateful for the support systems I have in place. Like you, Mentor. Your experience and guidance have been invaluable to me.\nMentor: I'm happy to be there for you, Mentee. It's been great seeing you grow and develop over the years.\nMentee: Speaking of growth, I've been really trying to live in the moment lately. It's been bringing me so much joy and fulfillment, and I feel more connected to the world around me.\nMentor: That's fantastic, Mentee. Being present and mindful can do wonders for your mental health and overall satisfaction with life. Keep it up!\nMentee: I definitely will, Mentor. And thanks again for finding my glasses. Your help means a lot to me. \n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentee acknowledges Mentor's achievements and ongoing support, expressing gratitude for their help with achieving sobriety.\n   \n2. Mentee used to feel overwhelmed but now finds fulfillment in living in the moment, crediting Mentor for their sobriety and expressing admiration for their success.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Of course, Mentee. I'm always here to help you out whenever you need it. Just remember, progress is a journey, not a destination.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provided is mostly helpful but not entirely perfect. It captures key elements from the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the Mentee acknowledging the Mentor's support in achieving sobriety and the Mentee's focus on living in the moment. These details are relevant to the conversation and helpful for understanding the progression of the mentor-mentee relationship, which would aid a language model in generating appropriate responses. However, the causality and natural phrasing of the sentences could be improved to make the connection between the Mentee's past struggles and their current growth more clear. Despite this slight limitation, the MEMORY is highly relevant and beneficial in capturing the essence of the Mentee's gratitude and growth, which relates closely to the dialogue context."
