Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, guess what? I sang a solo at church this past weekend!\nCo-workers B: That's awesome! I didn't know you sang.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, it's something I've always loved to do but haven't had the chance to do it in a while.\nCo-workers B: Well, it sounds like you did a great job. What did you sing?\nCo-workers A: I sang \"Amazing Grace\". It's always been one of my favorites.\nCo-workers B: That's such a beautiful song. You have a great voice.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! It was really nerve-wracking, but I'm glad I did it.\nCo-workers B: I'm sure the audience loved it. You've really got some talent.\nCo-workers A: Thanks again. It's just something I do for fun, but it's nice to know people enjoy it.\nCo-workers B: Definitely. It's great to have a hobby like that. Reminds me of when you uncovered that mystery a while back. You always seem to surprise us with your skills.\nCo-workers A: Haha, yeah. I do like a good challenge. Speaking of surprises, remember when I found out you were married? That was a shocker.\nCo-workers B: Oh gosh, yes. I forget sometimes that not everyone knows. But yeah, I've been married for a few years now.\nCo-workers A: Crazy how time flies. Like when we found out Ms. Singh was leaving our school. I still can't believe that was two years ago.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A and Co-worker B are both excited about payday and being able to pay off bills. This reminds them of the time they shared happy memories from their time working together. \nCo-worker A is described as having \"Sherlock Holmes-like skills\" and enjoys solving mysteries. This changed when Co-worker A found out that Co-worker B is married by doing some research on social media. Co-worker B was surprised by this discovery.\nCo-worker A and Co-worker B both plan to treat themselves to a nice dinner with their paychecks. Co-worker A suggests celebrating their detective work with drinks after work. Co-worker B, who is married, had a weekend where they went hiking and had dinner with friends.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Co-workers B",
    "raw_prediction": "It feels like just yesterday she was organizing all those school events. Time really does fly.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information regarding Co-worker A's inclination for solving mysteries, which ties directly to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Co-worker B mentions Co-worker A's \"Sherlock Holmes-like skills.\" This shared history strengthens the dialogue and provides an angle for Co-worker B to reference past interactions. The memory also mentions Co-worker B's married status, which is discussed in the dialogue. However, other aspects of the MEMORY, such as being excited about payday, treating themselves to dinner, and planning drinks, don't directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and aren't as useful for generating the next response in this specific conversation. Consequently, while MEMORY contains some helpful cues that are naturally linked to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, other parts are less relevant, justifying a mid-range score."
