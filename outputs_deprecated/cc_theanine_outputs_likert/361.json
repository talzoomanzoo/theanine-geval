Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Coach, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nAthlete: Ted Athlete unrolls the map. He looks at it for a few moments before tracing his finger along one of the highways. \"This is our route,\" he says finally, feeling in control.\nCoach: What route are you planning, Ted?\nAthlete: I'm thinking of taking the highway through the mountains, it's a bit longer, but the scenery is beautiful.\nCoach: That sounds like a good plan, as long as we factor in enough time for rest stops and breaks.\nAthlete: Yes, I was thinking we could stop at a few rest areas along the way. It's important to stay hydrated and keep our energy levels up during long drives.\nCoach: Definitely. Speaking of energy levels, how's your nutrition plan been going? Have you been keeping up with eating healthy foods like those bean sprouts we talked about?\nAthlete: Yes, Coach. I've been incorporating more nutrient-dense foods like bean sprouts into my diet. And I've noticed a significant improvement in my overall energy levels and performance on the field.\nCoach: That's great to hear. Your dedication to your health and performance is really paying off, Ted. I can't wait to see what you'll accomplish next.\nAthlete: Thanks, Coach. I feel like I've really found my stride and I'm excited for what the future holds.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Coach's advice on performance and focus has led to the Athlete's noticeable improvement and dedication to enhancing skills.\n2. The Coach's reminder about minimizing distractions has motivated both the Athlete and Coach to continue focusing on nutrition and training, highlighting the impact of small dietary changes on performance.\n3. The ongoing advice from the Coach to the Athlete about performance and focus aligns with discussions on pre-game meals, stressing the significance of a well-rounded diet and proper hydration for optimal performance.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information about the ongoing dynamic between the Athlete and Coach. It highlights the Athlete's improvement and dedication due to the Coach's advice, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where the Athlete discusses their nutrition and performance improvements. The sentences naturally connect by focusing on themes of nutrition, training, and dedication, which are significant in the current dialogue. Although the specific focus on minimizing distractions and pre-game meals are not directly mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, they align with the overall theme of performance and nutrition. The memory is informative and relevant, though some elements could be more directly tied to the exact points discussed in the dialogue."
