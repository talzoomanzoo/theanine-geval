Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination.\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off.\nNeighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks?\nNeighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else.\nNeighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location?\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home.\nNeighbors B: And remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more stressful and difficult the task will become.\nNeighbors A: You're right, I need to stop making excuses and just get it done. Thanks for the advice.\nNeighbors B: No problem. Speaking of goals, how's the house project coming along? \nNeighbors A: It's finished! Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard. It was a lot of work, but worth it in the end. \nNeighbors B: That's amazing, thanks for building me such a beautiful house. \nNeighbors A: Of course, I'm glad you like it. Remember when we watched the sunset over the London skyline? That was such a beautiful moment.\nNeighbors B: Yes, I still remember the pink and orange hues reflecting off the buildings. It was breathtaking.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A enjoys building houses and finishing them quickly, which causes Neighbor A to help Neighbor B build a new house with amazing features. This act of kindness makes Neighbor B remind Neighbor A of their potential to do good things, referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them. As a result, Neighbor A wants plants to thrive with sunlight, water, and love. \n\nNeighbor A is currently building a new house for Neighbor B with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard. This effort leads to Neighbor A helping Neighbor B build a new house with amazing features, and Neighbor B is grateful for the extra space. \n\nNeighbor A is building a new house for Neighbor B with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a big backyard, resulting in Neighbor B enjoying the sunset from their new backyard and expressing gratitude towards Neighbor A. This leads to a discussion between Neighbor A and Neighbor B about organizing a community event to make a positive impact and appreciate the beauty of their city, as well as both neighbors sharing an appreciation for nature and the beauty of sunsets.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Sunsets always remind me of the beauty of nature and how important it is to appreciate the little moments in life.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provided contains relevant information about the current context, particularly about the house-building project that was discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions the three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a large backyard, which were details discussed in the dialogue. However, the MEMORY also introduces additional elements such as Neighbor A wanting to help plants thrive and both neighbors wanting to organize a community event, which were not mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. These additions create a slight disconnect as they do not directly contribute to the continuation of the current conversation about procrastination and goal setting. Despite this, the MEMORY does capture the development of the neighbors' interactions related to the house and cultivates a sense of gratitude. Overall, it does provide some helpful context but also includes extraneous information that was not directly relevant to the current dialogue, resulting in a middle-tier score."
