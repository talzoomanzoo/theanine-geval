Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Mentee, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends.\nMentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace, understanding that starting over can be tough. \n2. The Mentee has been offered a job and has decided to take the job in the city, hoping to inspire others to join the cause of gender equality and fighting discrimination.\n3. The Mentor is supportive and praises the Mentee for their mature decision-making process, believing their work has been influential and that they will continue to make an impact in the world. Mentee agreed to go back to the store to make things right and expressed gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "You're right, Mentor. I'll try to stay positive and open to new experiences. Hopefully, I'll make some new friends soon.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains relevant information about the interactions between the Mentor and Mentee, such as the Mentor reassuring the Mentee about starting over (Sentence 1), which aligns well with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where the Mentee talks about feeling lonely in a new city. This past interaction can help generate an empathetic response from the Mentor. However, Sentence 2 introduces new information about the Mentee accepting a job and their aspirations which, while interesting, does not directly connect with the immediate context of loneliness and starting over. Sentence 3 discusses the Mentor's support and the Mentee's decision-making but seems only partially related to the current emotional context expressed in the dialogue. The sentence about going back to the store is particularly disconnected.\n\nOverall, while the MEMORY contains useful cues for generating a supportive continuation in the conversation, it also includes details that aren't currently relevant, affecting the overall fluidity and helpfulness of the memory in guiding a response."
