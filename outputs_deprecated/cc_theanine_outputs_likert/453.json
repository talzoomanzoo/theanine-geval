Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something.\nClassmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\nClassmates A: Well, it’s been on my mind for a while now and I couldn’t shake it off. I just can't stop thinking about you.\nClassmates B: Oh, really?\nClassmates A: Yes, really. I know we've been friends for a while now, but I feel like there may be something more between us.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B are supportive friends who look out for each other during stressful times. Classmates A values setting high standards and is hesitant to lower them.\n2. Classmates A had doubts about trusting Classmates B due to rumors about their reliability. Classmates A and B are students in the same class. Classmates A discovered a secret that Classmates B has been keeping. Classmate A recalls a moment where they admired Classmate B's courage and strength in sharing a secret, showing their supportive and compassionate nature.\n3. Classmates A tends to overthink things and appreciated Classmates B's support and advice. Classmate A is very self-critical and struggles with feeling satisfied with their work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I appreciate your honesty, but I see you more as a supportive friend. I value our friendship and don't want to risk changing that dynamic.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a proper next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It provides context about the supportive friendship between Classmates A and B, which is relevant to Classmate A's expression of deeper feelings. Specifically, it explains that Classmate A tends to overthink, appreciates Classmate B's support, values high standards, and has previously admired Classmate B's courage. These details help form a clear picture of their past interactions, emotions, and dynamics that could influence their current dialogue. However, some sentences about doubts due to rumors are less directly relevant to the current context about deeper relationship feelings, but they are phrased such that they don't disrupt the understanding of the primary memory. Overall, the information is well-structured and provides relevant cues to assist in generating a response."
