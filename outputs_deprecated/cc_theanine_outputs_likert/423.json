Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel so grateful to have a boss who is always so supportive of me.\nCo-workers B: That's amazing to hear. Having a supportive boss can make all the difference in how you feel about your job.\nCo-workers A: Definitely. It makes me feel secure in my position and motivated to do my best work.\nCo-workers B: It's great to have that kind of positive reinforcement. Do you remember when we were working on that movie together and you were feeling really frustrated?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. [Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B feel that their collaboration brought out the best in each other during the shoot.] - (React) - [Co-worker A and Co-worker B have a strong bond and mutual respect for each other's talents.]\n2. [Co-worker A and Co-worker B are excited about working on future projects together and even starting their own production company someday.] - (Changed) - [Co-worker A and Co-worker B are optimistic about their creative futures and are considering entrepreneurship.]\n3. [Co-worker A and Co-worker B met on a movie set and are now good friends.] - (React) - [Co-worker A values the friendship and growth they've experienced with Co-worker B.]\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, that was a challenging time, but your encouragement and support helped me get through it. I appreciate that so much.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for understanding the relationship between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, which can aid in generating an appropriate response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The first memory sentence emphasizes their effective collaboration and mutual respect, which aligns with the dialogue's theme of appreciation and support in a work setting. The second memory sentence introduces the idea of future collaborative projects and entrepreneurship, which while not directly connected to the current dialogue, adds depth to their relationship by showing their enthusiasm for working together. The third memory sentence contextualizes the origin of their relationship and highlights the personal growth and friendship they share. Overall, MEMORY provides a cohesive narrative that demonstrates the development of their professional and personal relationship, aiding in generating a meaningful response to the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
