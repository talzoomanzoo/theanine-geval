    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to share something with you. I helped out a neighbor in need over the weekend.\nClassmates B: That's really kind of you. What did you do to help?\nClassmates A: She was moving and needed some extra hands to pack up her things and load them onto a truck. So I spent most of the day helping her out.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B has been supportive and helpful to Classmates A. As a result, Classmates A wants to value each other's opinions, even though Classmates B was initially worried about Classmates A going out with friends.\n   \n2. Classmates A is struggling to make friends and adjust to a new school, which makes Classmates A appreciate Classmates B's efforts and support.\n\n3. Classmates B advised Classmates A to drive safely to avoid accidents, showing responsibility and reliability. This changed the dynamic, leading to Classmates B being supportive and helpful to Classmates A.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's so thoughtful of you to help out your neighbor like that. I'm sure she really appreciated your assistance.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It highlights that Classmates B has been supportive and helpful to Classmates A, which aligns with the tone of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Classmates B acknowledges Classmates A's kindness. However, the details in the MEMORY about Classmates A struggling to make friends and adjusting to a new school, or the advice to drive safely, are not directly relevant to the specific context of discussing helping a neighbor move. These elements, while informative about their relationship dynamics, do not connect clearly to the immediate context. The MEMORY could be more focused and directly linked to instances of helping or supporting others, which would make it more beneficial for generating responses specific to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences are naturally structured but could be more directly relevant."
