Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, how are you feeling today?\nClassmates B: I'm feeling frustrated. I wish I could do things on my own.\nClassmates A: I understand how you feel. It can be tough when you feel like you're dependent on others.\nClassmates B: Yeah, exactly. I don't want to be a burden on anyone.\nClassmates A: You're not a burden, don't worry. And I'm always here to help you out.\nClassmates B: I appreciate that, but I don't want to always rely on others. I want to be more independent.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B, who are both keeping up with their math class homework, find it awesome that Classmates A is pursuing their passion for music. This led to them enjoying jamming together and planning to collaborate on music in the future. Their friendly and supportive relationship is evident in their conversation about their experiences.\n\n2. Classmates A and B, who are both keeping up with their math class homework, find it awesome that Classmates A is pursuing their passion for music. This led to Classmates A buying a sleek and red Mustang GT car, while Classmates B recently bought a red sports car and enjoys the fun and freedom of driving it.\n\n3. Classmates A and B, who are both keeping up with their math class homework, find it awesome that Classmates A is pursuing their passion for music. This led to them enjoying jamming together and planning to collaborate on music in the future. Additionally, Classmates A enjoys reminiscing about childhood memories, including playing on swings and making music with friends.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Classmates A",
    "raw_prediction": "I admire your determination to be more independent. It's great that you're motivated to take charge of your own path.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains three sentences that provide background information about Classmates A and B. However, most of the information does not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Classmate B's desire for independence and feeling like a burden. The MEMORY references their interest in music and math homework, which may indicate their friendship and supportiveness, but it doesn't specifically connect to the struggle for independence expressed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The information about music collaboration and the cars they bought does not aid in generating a response to the current emotional context Classmate B is discussing. Hence, while the memory is relevant in showing their friendship, it lacks direct relevance and a clear connection to the immediate context of the conversation."
