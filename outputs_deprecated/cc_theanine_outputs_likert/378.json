    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to share something with you. I helped out a neighbor in need over the weekend.\nClassmates B: That's really kind of you. What did you do to help?\nClassmates A: She was moving and needed some extra hands to pack up her things and load them onto a truck. So I spent most of the day helping her out.\nClassmates B: Wow, that's really generous of you. I'm sure your neighbor really appreciated it.\nClassmates A: I hope so. I just felt like it was the right thing to do. I know if I were in that situation, I would appreciate any help I could get.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Classmates B's handling of a previous mix-up with the class schedule demonstrated responsibility and reliability, which led to Classmates B being supportive and helpful to Classmates A. This further strengthened their friendship and made them feel comfortable talking to each other about anything.\n\n- Classmates A's appreciation of Classmates B's efforts and support highlighted the strong bond between them, emphasizing the value they place on their friendship. This mutual appreciation also extended to Classmates B being initially worried about Classmates A going out with friends, showcasing their respect for each other's opinions and care for each other.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about the relationship and interactions between Classmates A and B, such as their mutual appreciation and supportive friendship. However, it does not directly relate or add helpful contextual information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Classmates A helping a neighbor. The information about past events does indicate a strong bond between the classmates, but it lacks clear relevance or connection to the current topic of discussion about helping the neighbor. The statements in MEMORY are not structured in a way that makes the development or causality clear enough to aid Classmates B in generating a more contextually informed response regarding the neighbor's help situation. It offers insights into the nature of their friendship but doesn't enhance the ability to construct a response to the ongoing dialogue directly."
