Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I'm the boss!\nCo-workers B: Yeah, we know. You don't have to remind us every five minutes.\nCo-workers A: I just want everything to go smoothly and according to plan.\nCo-workers B: I understand that, but it doesn't always have to be your way or the highway.\nCo-workers A: Well, I just think that my way is usually the best way.\nCo-workers B: And sometimes it is, but we all have different ideas and perspectives to bring to the table.\nCo-workers A: Okay, I see your point. I'll try to be more open-minded in the future.\nCo-workers B: That's all we can ask for. Remember that we're a team and we all have something valuable to contribute.\nCo-workers A: You're right. I'm glad we can have these conversations and work towards being better together.\nCo-workers B: Me too. Speaking of working together, do you remember when you gave me back my watch a few months ago? That meant a lot to me.\nCo-workers A: Of course I remember! I'm happy we're friends again.\nCo-workers B: Me too. And do you still have that baby doll and rattle you bought a couple of years ago?\nCo-workers A: Yes, actually! I gave them to my niece and she loves them.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A takes pride in their work and enjoys helping others, while both Co-worker A and Co-worker B value communication and understanding in relationships. They find these moments of connection make work more enjoyable. \nCo-worker A's good work ethic is acknowledged by Co-worker B, leading to a positive impact on the workplace. Co-worker A made Co-worker B happy again by returning a watch to them. Additionally, Co-worker A bought a baby doll and a rattle for themselves, even though they do not have any kids, and later gifted them to a friend who is expecting. \nBoth Co-worker A and Co-worker B excel at working well with others and resolving issues. Co-worker A is giving Co-worker B a massage to help them relax.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's so sweet of you to give them to your niece. It's great to see you spreading joy and kindness, even outside of work.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provided contains several helpful and relevant details that can assist in constructing a coherent and contextually appropriate response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it accurately references Co-worker A's appreciation for helping others, which is reflected in the context when Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's flexibility and open-mindedness. It also connects with the specific instance where Co-worker A returns the watch, which is brought up in the dialogue and suggests amicable reconciliation, thus demonstrating clear development of their relationship. \n\nHowever, there are details in MEMORY that do not directly relate to, or are slightly altered from, the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the mention of Co-worker A buying the baby doll and rattle for themselves, while the dialogue specifies these were bought for a niece. Such discrepancies could lead to confusion. Despite this, the MEMORY is mostly helpful, providing a beneficial backdrop of the co-workers' relationship dynamics and work ethics, contributing to coherent and meaningful future interactions. The content is structured in a way that illustrates causality and connection, hence earning a score of 4."
