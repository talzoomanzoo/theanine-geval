    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just can't believe he left me like that. I thought we were happy together.\nNeighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left?\nNeighbors A: No, I haven't. I don't even know what I would say to him. I feel like I'm not enough, like I wasn't good enough for him.\nNeighbors B: That's not true, Neighbor A. You are an amazing person and you deserve someone who appreciates you for who you are.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A recently moved into the neighborhood and wanted to live in a nicer area, which is why they have a bit of a drive to get to the park where they meet with Neighbor B. This change led to both of them enjoying going for walks together, especially to the park. As a result, Neighbor B is offering support and companionship to Neighbor A during their difficult time. \n\nNeighbor A was tired of living in a run-down apartment complex and wanted to improve their quality of life, which caused them and Neighbor B to become neighbors who catch up outside of their neighborhood. This connection led to both of them enjoying going for walks together, especially to the park, and developing a close friendship where they have shared memories of spending time together in the park.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant context related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives background on Neighbor A's recent move to the neighborhood, which ties into their relationship with Neighbor B. The memory mentions their shared enjoyment of walks to the park and how they've developed a close friendship, which enhances understanding of Neighbor B's supportive role. However, it lacks direct relevance to the immediate emotional situation of Neighbor A's relationship troubles discussed in the dialogue. While it provides some useful context about their friendship and supportive dynamic, it doesn't give much insight into the current emotional state or history of Neighbor A's romantic relationship. The memory is helpful in understanding the general support system, but not directly in addressing the relationship issue discussed."
