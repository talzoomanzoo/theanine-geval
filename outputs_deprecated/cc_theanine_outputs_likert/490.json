Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I just finished my computer course, and I learned so much about using computers effectively.\nClassmates B: That's great! What did you learn specifically?\nClassmates A: Oh, a lot of things. I learned how to use different programs and software for different tasks, and how to choose the right one depending on what I need to do.\nClassmates B: Do you have any software recommendations for me? I always struggle with choosing the right program.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Classmates A acknowledges a mistake and plans to learn from it. This shows that Classmate B is a supportive friend who listens and offers to help. As friends who help each other with schoolwork, Classmates A and Classmates B have a strong bond.\n- Classmates B emphasizes the consequences of Classmates A's actions and the need for responsibility. This leads to the topic of how Classmates B and Classmates A used to dance a lot in middle school. Classmate A appreciates having friends who are there for them during difficult times, and Classmates B supported Classmates A through a tough time by listening to them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Sure! One program I found really helpful is Microsoft Excel for organizing data and creating spreadsheets. It's user-friendly and versatile.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided contains some information about the relationship between Classmates A and B, indicating that they have a supportive friendship and a shared history of dancing in middle school. However, it is not directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on learning about computers and software recommendations. The MEMORY fails to provide helpful contextual information that would aid a language model in generating a response about software recommendations. Additionally, the sentences in the MEMORY do not clearly demonstrate the development of past interactions that are pertinent to the current conversation about computer courses and software. While the reference to a supportive friendship is noted, this information is not sufficiently aligned with the dialogue's context regarding technology."
