Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Can you believe it? I'm a millionaire now!\nNeighbors B: Wow, that's incredible! How did it happen?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A appreciates Neighbors B's understanding and willingness to listen and talk about the experience. This leads to Neighbor A suggesting planning something else to do together over the weekend. The conversation reveals that Neighbors A is feeling stagnant in their current job and is looking for more growth and challenge, which caused Neighbors A to make a big career change recently and feel much happier now.\n\nNeighbors A appreciates Neighbors B's understanding and willingness to listen and talk about the experience. This leads to Neighbor A suggesting planning something else to do together over the weekend. The discussion reflects that Neighbors A is feeling stagnant in their current job and is looking for more growth and challenge, which originates from a conversation Neighbors A and B had a couple of years ago about needing a change.\n\nNeighbors B is supportive and believes Neighbors A's story, suggesting looking up UFO sightings in the area. This prompts Neighbor A to suggest planning something else to do together over the weekend. Neighbor A expresses the desire to start looking for new opportunities soon, needing to update their resume and start networking, which resulted in Neighbors A taking the leap to make a change and feeling glad they did.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about Neighbors A feeling stagnant in their job and making a career change, which may explain their newfound millionaire status. However, the repetitions and the focus on weekend plans do not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about becoming a millionaire. The MEMORY contains relevant information but lacks clarity and direct links to the current conversation topic about Neighbors A's recent success. The statements are somewhat helpful for understanding the characters' relationship and past discussions but could be more directly connected to the present dialogue context."
