    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Husband, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I'm feeling stuck with my writing. I've been searching everywhere for new ideas, but nothing seems to work.\nWife: Have you tried brainstorming with me? Sometimes bouncing ideas off of someone else can help.\nHusband: I have, but I don't want to bother you too much with my writing stuff.\nWife: Nonsense! You can always come to me with anything. Plus, I enjoy helping you with your creative process. Have you also tried revisiting some of the writing prompts we did in our creative writing class?\nHusband: I have, but I feel like I'm just repeating the same stories over and over again.\nWife: Maybe it's time to take a step back and try something new. Have you ever tried writing in a different genre or experimenting with different styles?\nHusband: That's a good idea. I guess I just haven't had the courage to step out of my comfort zone.\nWife: Remember when you faced your fear of public speaking during your fifth-grade presentation? You can do this too. Sometimes, the biggest breakthroughs come from taking risks.\n\nMEMORY:\nThe wife is knowledgeable about movies and is willing to share her passion with the husband. Both the husband and wife express a desire for happiness and understanding in the situation. The wife reassures the husband that it's okay to be different and encourages him to embrace who he is. \n\nThe husband is open to learning more about movies, showing a willingness to try again. Both the husband and wife express a desire for happiness and understanding in the situation. Wife suggests that husband should try using more modern language to be better understood. The husband gave a fifth-grade presentation in the past.\n\nThe husband is open to learning more about movies, showing a willingness to try again. Both the husband and wife express a desire for happiness and understanding in the situation. Husband agrees to try adapting to modern language for better communication with his wife. The wife reassures the husband that it's okay to be different and encourages him to embrace who he is.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "You're right. I need to channel that same courage into my writing. I'll give it a shot and see where it takes me. Thanks for the reminder.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information that could be helpful for generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For instance, it mentions the husband's past experience with a fifth-grade presentation, which the wife brings up as a source of inspiration in the dialogue. This connection can be useful for reinforcing the wife's point about taking risks and embracing new opportunities. However, there are many aspects of the memory that are not directly relevant to the current dialogue context, such as the husband's openness to learning about movies and a repeated mention of both the husband and wife desiring happiness and understanding. These aspects do not provide significant help to the current conversation, which focuses on overcoming creative blocks and stepping out of comfort zones. The MEMORY does communicate past interactions and attitudes, but some of these are not well-connected to the current context, thus the overall helpfulness is moderate."
