Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just visited this amazing new city. The architecture was stunning, the streets were so clean, and the people were very friendly.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like you had a great time! Which city did you visit?\nNeighbors A: It was Chicago. I had never been before, but it exceeded all my expectations.\nNeighbors B: I bet it was a nice change of scenery from our neighborhood.\nNeighbors A: Definitely. But you know, it's interesting how much our neighborhood has grown on me over the years. I remember when I first moved here, I was so unsure about it.\nNeighbors B: Yeah, I remember. But you stayed because you wanted to be here.\nNeighbors A: That's right. And since then, I've made so many great memories here. It's become my home.\nNeighbors B: And you're still spending time with God every day, right?\nNeighbors A: Yes, I am. It brings me so much peace and happiness.\nNeighbors B: That's really admirable. And speaking of power, I remember you telling me about that time when you could make me do anything you wanted.\nNeighbors A: Oh, gosh. That was so long ago. I can't even believe I had that kind of power over you.\nNeighbors B: I'm just glad we've both grown since then, and we can have a friendship that's based on mutual respect.\nNeighbors A: Absolutely. And now, I'm excited to explore my new neighborhood and get to know the people here. It feels like a fresh start.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A has been living in the same place for a long time and enjoys the neighborhood and people there, feeling comfortable and safe, and has made good friends, including Neighbors B. This has led to Neighbors A being excited to explore the neighborhood, make new friends, and have a fresh start. \nNeighbors B used to obey Neighbors A's commands, but they have both grown since then and now have a friendship based on mutual respect.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's always exciting to have a fresh start and meet new people. I'm sure you'll make just as many great memories in your new neighborhood as you did here.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provided effectively captures key elements from the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the long-term residence of Neighbor A and the mutual respect between Neighbors A and B. These points aid a language model in understanding the progression and nature of the relationship between the two speakers. The MEMORY succinctly encapsulates the comfort and familiarity that Neighbor A feels towards the neighborhood and touches upon the historical dynamic between the neighbors, indicating growth and mature friendship. While the MEMORY does not cover every detail of the dialogue, it offers a clear and structured depiction of background interactions and the current state of the relationship, which makes it quite helpful for generating a relevant and contextually appropriate next response."
