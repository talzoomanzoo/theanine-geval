Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Mentor, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Thank you for finding my glasses for me, Mentor. I always seem to misplace them.\nMentor: Not a problem, Mentee. I'm glad I could help. \nMentee: This actually reminds me of when I was struggling with substance abuse. I would often lose things or forget where I put things because of my drinking. It's amazing how much clearer my mind is now that I'm sober.\nMentor: That's a great observation, Mentee. Sobriety can definitely improve your cognitive abilities and overall wellbeing. It's amazing how much substance abuse can hold us back in life.\nMentee: Yeah, it's definitely a difficult journey, but I'm grateful for the support systems I have in place. Like you, Mentor. Your experience and guidance have been invaluable to me.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentee credits Mentor for their help in achieving sobriety and expresses gratitude for the support, which causes Mentor to be proud of Mentee for making positive changes and taking control of their life.\n2. Mentor has been supportive of Mentee's journey to sobriety, and as a result, Mentee, who has a history of substance abuse but has been sober for a year, found getting sober to be a challenging process but is now proud of their progress.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 5\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided is highly relevant and helpful in the context of the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Both sentences in MEMORY reflect the key themes and interactions between the Mentor and Mentee, specifically mentioning the Mentee's gratitude towards the Mentor's support in their journey to sobriety. This directly aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where the Mentee expresses appreciation for the Mentor's guidance. Additionally, the MEMORY showcases the continuity of the Mentee's journey and the Mentor's support, which is useful for the language model to generate a conclusive and supportive response to extend the conversation. It's well-phrased and logically structured, allowing the language model to identify significant cues easily."
