Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I need to talk to you about something important.\nClassmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\nClassmates A: I know about your affair with that other woman.\nClassmates B: What are you talking about? I don't have an affair with anyone.\nClassmates A: Don't lie to me! I saw you together at the restaurant last week.\nClassmates B: That was just a business meeting. We were discussing a potential collaboration on a music project.\nClassmates A: I don't believe you. You're just trying to cover it up. I'm going to tell everyone and ruin your career.\nClassmates B: Why are you doing this? I thought we were friends.\nClassmates A: I can't stand that you're a better singer than I am. I'm envious of your talent and success.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates A suggests grabbing lunch together, showing an interest in spending more time with Classmates B. This leads to both Classmates A and B enjoying talking to each other and considering themselves great study partners. As a result, they are excited about seeing Lady Gaga in concert and are looking forward to singing and dancing along to her hits.\n\nClassmates A and B have a good relationship, with Classmates A expressing admiration for Classmates B's intelligence and sense of humor. This positive interaction leads to both Classmates enjoying talking to each other and considering themselves great study partners. Additionally, Classmate B admires Classmate A's dedication and believes they have a knack for science. They bond over their shared favorite Lady Gaga song, \"Born This Way.\"\n\nClassmates A has developed a crush on Classmates B, which Classmates B finds flattering. This genuine interest leads to Classmates A finding it refreshing to talk to someone genuinely interested in science and learning. As a result, Classmate B admires Classmate A's dedication and believes they have a knack for science. They also bond over their shared favorite Lady Gaga song, \"Born This Way.\"\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Classmates B",
    "raw_prediction": "I had no idea you felt that way. I'm sorry you see it like that.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some background information on the previous positive interactions between Classmates A and B, such as their shared interest in Lady Gaga and their mutual admiration for each other's intelligence and dedication. However, the content of MEMORY does not directly relate to or explain the current conflict in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which revolves around a suspected affair and feelings of envy. The MEMORY lacks a clear connection to the context and does not offer useful cues or developments that would help a language model generate a relevant response to the current situation. Therefore, while the MEMORY provides a setting of past interactions, it does not significantly aid in addressing the specific issue at hand in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
