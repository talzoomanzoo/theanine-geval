Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Wife, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I'm feeling stuck with my writing. I've been searching everywhere for new ideas, but nothing seems to work.\nWife: Have you tried brainstorming with me? Sometimes bouncing ideas off of someone else can help.\nHusband: I have, but I don't want to bother you too much with my writing stuff.\nWife: Nonsense! You can always come to me with anything. Plus, I enjoy helping you with your creative process. Have you also tried revisiting some of the writing prompts we did in our creative writing class?\nHusband: I have, but I feel like I'm just repeating the same stories over and over again.\nWife: Maybe it's time to take a step back and try something new. Have you ever tried writing in a different genre or experimenting with different styles?\nHusband: That's a good idea. I guess I just haven't had the courage to step out of my comfort zone.\nWife: Remember when you faced your fear of public speaking during your fifth-grade presentation? You can do this too. Sometimes, the biggest breakthroughs come from taking risks.\nHusband: You're right. Maybe it's time to try something completely different and see where it takes me.\n\nMEMORY:\nThe wife reassures the husband that it's okay to be different and encourages him to embrace who he is. She is knowledgeable about movies and is willing to share her passion with the husband. Both the husband and wife express a desire for happiness and understanding in the situation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provided is not very detailed or connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While it offers some insight into the wife's general supportive nature and the couple's mutual desire for happiness and understanding, it lacks specific references to the writing-related concerns discussed in the dialogue. The memory could benefit from including more direct connections to the context, such as the wife's support for the husband's writing process and her willingness to brainstorm and motivate him to try new things. The sentences also lack clarity in demonstrating the development or causality of past interactions related to the current dialogue, making it less helpful for generating a fully informed response."
