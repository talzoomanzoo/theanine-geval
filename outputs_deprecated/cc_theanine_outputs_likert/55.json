Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today?\nCo-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing.\nCo-workers A: Do you need any help? I don't want you to get overwhelmed.\nCo-workers B: That's really nice of you, but I don't want to burden you with my work.\nCo-workers A: It's not a burden if it's something I can do to support you. Plus, helping you out makes me feel good too.\nCo-workers B: You're right, thank you. You always go above and beyond to help me out.\nCo-workers A: That's what co-workers are for. We're a team and we need to support each other.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of teamwork, remember when you showed me your plans for the future a few months ago? I'm still excited about the idea of working on a project together.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A has been feeling off lately, but is grateful to Co-worker B for letting them borrow the horse and is having a great time riding her. This has motivated Co-worker A about the future and they are excited to work with Co-worker B. Co-worker B, who offered help and support to Co-worker A, is glad the trade worked out well for both of them. Additionally, Co-worker B is impressed with Co-worker A's well-thought-out plans for their partnership. Both co-workers believe they have the potential to create something great together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I remember that conversation! I'm thrilled that you're still on board with the idea. I think we can really make something amazing happen together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does contain relevant information that aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly the excitement and anticipation surrounding the co-workers' plans to work on a project together, which Co-worker B mentioned in the dialogue. The MEMORY also provides some context about Co-worker A's recent feelings and gratitude towards Co-worker B, which helps in understanding their relationship dynamics. However, the mention of borrowing a horse, although it gave Co-worker A motivation for the future, does not directly tie into the dialogue provided. The MEMORY could be structured more clearly to emphasize the relevant parts about teamwork and co-worker collaboration, rather than including unrelated elements like the horse. Overall, the MEMORY is somewhat helpful to generate a response in line with the current dialogue but could be improved for clarity and relevance."
