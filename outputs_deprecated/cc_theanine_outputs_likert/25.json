Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Haha, that was a good one! Aren't you glad I pushed you into the cold water?\nNeighbors B: No, I'm not glad. That was completely uncalled for.\nNeighbors A: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Lighten up a bit.\nNeighbors B: It wasn't funny. You shouldn't push people like that, especially into cold water.\nNeighbors A: Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Let's just forget about it.\nNeighbors B: Okay, but just don't do it again.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A and B started off not knowing each other well but wanting to spend more time together. As time passed, they became good friends and enjoy reminiscing about past events. Neighbors B, who is supportive, suggests making something together and shows consideration by suggesting having extra water on hand for the next time Neighbors A mows the lawn.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about the development of the relationship between Neighbors A and B, indicating they started off not knowing each other well and eventually became good friends. This background is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Neighbors A and B are having a casual but slightly tense interaction following a prank. The memory indicates they enjoy reminiscing, which aligns with the playful yet apologetic tone seen in the dialogue.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY lacks specific past interactions or events that could further enrich the context for the given dialogue situation. While it does mention Neighbors B being supportive and considerate, this doesn't directly relate to or impact the specific conversation about being pushed into the water. The helpfulness could be improved with more directly related memories that provide insights into Neighbors B's response to pranks or their sensitivity to jokes.\n\nOverall, the memory is somewhat relevant and naturally phrased, giving a brief overview of their relationship, but it could be more immediately helpful by including details that better tie into the current dialogue's dynamics."
