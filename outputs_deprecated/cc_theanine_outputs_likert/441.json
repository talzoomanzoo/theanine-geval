Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Mentor, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, have you ever tried to imagine what it would be like to think like someone else?\nMentor: Yes, I have. It's a great way to better understand and empathize with others.\nMentee: That's exactly what I thought. I've been trying to imagine what personY is thinking lately. It's been helping me to understand their perspective a bit better.\nMentor: That's a great approach. Putting ourselves in someone else's shoes can help us see things from a different angle and see where they're coming from.\nMentee: Exactly. And it also helps me to be more compassionate towards them. I think it's important for us to be more understanding and supportive of each other, especially in difficult times.\nMentor: I agree completely. It's important to be kind and compassionate towards others, especially when they may be going through something challenging.\nMentee: And I think it's also important to remember that we all have different perspectives and experiences that shape our thoughts and actions.\nMentor: Absolutely. Keeping an open mind and being willing to listen to others can help us to learn from them and grow as individuals.\nMentee: That's so true. And it's a great way to build stronger relationships with others. So, Mentor, have you ever tried to imagine what it's like to be in a different culture or country?\nMentor: Yes, as a matter of fact, I have. I think it's important to learn about other cultures and broaden our perspectives.\nMentee: That's really interesting. Where are you from, Mentor?\nMentor: I'm originally from Italy.\nMentee: Ah, that's so exciting! I've always wanted to go to Italy and experience the culture there.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentee expresses gratitude towards Mentor for the advice and shows willingness to try it out, mentioning Mentor's background of being from Italy and having lived in the United States.\n2. Mentee expresses the desire to teach religion to help people find meaning in their lives, wanting to make a positive impact and being thankful for Mentor's support.\n3. Mentor advises Mentee on self-care practices related to listening to their body and setting a bedtime routine, which leads to a discussion on escaping oppressive rules of a cult. Additionally, Mentor encourages Mentee to approach teaching religion with an open mind and heart, leading to Mentor becoming a mentor to help others in similar situations.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Italy is a beautiful country with so much culture and history to explore. If you ever get the chance to visit, I highly recommend it.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information that somewhat relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, especially in providing a background on the mentee's appreciation and willingness to engage with Mentor's advice, as well as the Mentor's diverse experiences that could aid the Mentee's learning journey. However, the connection to teaching religion and self-care practices are not directly relevant to the current dialogue, which focuses more on empathizing and understanding different perspectives, cultures, and personal experiences. The MEMORY does provide a helpful glimpse into the ongoing mentor-mentee dynamic, but it is not entirely pertinent or organized to directly assist the current conversation flow regarding cultural exploration and perspective-taking. However, the memories are naturally phrased in a way that the language model may discern the unrelated parts."
