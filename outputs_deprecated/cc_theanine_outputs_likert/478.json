Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately.\nClassmates B: Why is that?\nClassmates A: I want to be smart and I think algebra can help me think more logically and critically.\nClassmates B: That's a good goal to have. Have you noticed any improvements in your thinking since studying algebra?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A's past experience with tough competition in middle school from a fast girl motivated them to improve, causing them to struggle with feeling competitive and the need to be the best at everything. As a result, Classmates A, who has not experienced similar pains in the past, is feeling worried about the situation.\n\n2. Classmates A, who is always looking to challenge themselves and improve their skills, reacts positively to Classmates B's support and suggestion to take a step back to find a balance. This leads to Classmates B offering to take Classmates A to the hospital, but Classmates A declines, saying they will manage, as they had a muscle strain in their arm but did not go to the hospital. \n\n3. Classmates B's acknowledgment of Classmates A's determination and competitiveness prompts them to offer support and suggest that Classmates A get their arm checked out, which leads to Classmate A having a muscle strain in their arm but not going to the hospital.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Classmates A",
    "raw_prediction": "Definitely, I feel like my problem-solving skills have gotten better.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains information about Classmates A's competitive nature, their desire to improve, and some unrelated events about a muscle strain and the hospital. While the first sentence in MEMORY seems to somewhat track with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT by mentioning Classmates Aâ€™s desire to improve and competitiveness, it does not directly relate to their interest in algebra. The details about a past muscle strain and a trip to the hospital do not connect with the ongoing dialogue about studying and logical thinking. Overall, MEMORY does not provide enough relevant context or coherent developments that directly aid the language model in generating a more contextually driven continuation of the dialogue. The MEMORY seems fragmented and disconnected from the specific focus of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
