Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I just gave my boss the written report. I hope she finds it helpful.\nCo-workers B: Did you make sure to include all the necessary details?\nCo-workers A: Yes, I made sure to cover everything we talked about in the meeting. I even added some extra information that I thought could be useful.\nCo-workers B: That's smart thinking. It shows that you're invested in the company and want to make sure things run smoothly.\nCo-workers A: Thanks. I learned a lot from taking over the family business. It taught me the importance of being efficient and proactive.\nCo-workers B: I remember you telling me about that. It's amazing how much you've accomplished since then.\nCo-workers A: It's been a journey, but I'm glad to see the business flourishing. It gives me a sense of pride and accomplishment.\nCo-workers B: I can tell. You're always trying to find ways to improve things.\nCo-workers A: Exactly. That's why I felt a written report would be the best way to communicate the information to my boss. It saves time and ensures everything is organized.\nCo-workers B: Makes sense. I'm sure your boss will appreciate your efforts.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A's journey of taking over the family business and making changes to adapt to modern times has led to the business flourishing recently.\n2. Co-worker A's act of giving Co-worker B a pen as a gesture reflects the value both of them place on trust in their relationships, both personal and professional.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I hope so. I just want to make sure our work is aligned with the company's goals and vision.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY contains two statements, one of which is directly related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The first sentence in the MEMORY about Co-worker A taking over the family business and the resulting prosperity is helpful as it aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Co-worker A discusses their past experience and accomplishments within the family business. This information provides useful context for Co-worker A's actions and mindset, particularly the approach of writing a report and being proactive in their work environment.\n\nHowever, the second sentence in the MEMORY regarding the gesture of giving Co-worker B a pen, while illustrative of the value they place on trust, is not directly pertinent to the immediate conversation about the written report and professional accomplishments. It is somewhat peripheral to the current dialogue but still reveals a positive aspect of their professional relationship.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY partially satisfies the criterion by providing some relevant context but also includes a less directly related sentence. Hence, the MEMORY earns an intermediate score of 3 for its moderate helpfulness in generating the next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
