Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Husband, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I'm feeling stuck with my writing. I've been searching everywhere for new ideas, but nothing seems to work.\nWife: Have you tried brainstorming with me? Sometimes bouncing ideas off of someone else can help.\nHusband: I have, but I don't want to bother you too much with my writing stuff.\nWife: Nonsense! You can always come to me with anything. Plus, I enjoy helping you with your creative process. Have you also tried revisiting some of the writing prompts we did in our creative writing class?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The husband and wife express a desire for happiness and understanding in the situation. The wife suggests that husband should try using more modern language to be better understood. The husband talks differently than most people, using words like \"thou\" and \"thee.\"\n2. The wife is knowledgeable about movies and is willing to share her passion with the husband. The wife reassures the husband that it's okay to be different and encourages him to embrace who he is.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY does not provide much helpful information relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context is about the husband feeling stuck with his writing and the wife's willingness to help him brainstorm. The MEMORY contains information on two topics: the husband and wife's desire for happiness and understanding, with a suggestion for using modern language, and the wife's knowledge of movies and encouragement for the husband to embrace his uniqueness. \n\nWhile the second point in MEMORY could tangentially relate to the wife's supportive attitude in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, it does not directly connect or contribute to the specific issue of the husband's writer's block or the process of brainstorming for new ideas. The sentences in MEMORY lack a clear development or causality associated with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, and they are not structured in a way that clearly highlights potential past interactions that would be relevant to the current discussion. \n\nOverall, MEMORY provides minimal aid in generating a relevant response in this scenario, hence the score of 2."
