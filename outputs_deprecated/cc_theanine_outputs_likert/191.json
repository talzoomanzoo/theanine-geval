Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, have you checked out my new blog? It's all about promoting under-the-radar artists.\nClassmates B: I haven't had a chance to yet, but that sounds really cool! What inspired you to start it?\nClassmates A: Well, I've always had a passion for the arts, but I was too afraid to pursue it. I finally realized that it's what I really love, and I wanted to share that love with others.\nClassmates B: That's amazing. It takes a lot of courage to pursue your passions like that.\nClassmates A: Yeah, it was scary at first, but the response has been really positive. I'm so glad I finally decided to take the leap.\nClassmates B: I'm proud of you. It's always great to see someone following their dreams.\nClassmates A: Thanks, it's been a journey, but I'm really happy with where I am now. It's crazy to think that years ago, I was so hesitant to even share this part of myself.\nClassmates B: It just goes to show that it's never too late to start pursuing what you love. Remember when we talked about you living your life on your own terms? You're doing just that.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates B encouraged Classmates A to step out of their comfort zone and try new things for personal growth. This aligns with their shared value of trying new things and taking risks for personal development. As a result, Classmates A values living life on their own terms and being content with their choices. This attitude towards independence and happiness has led Classmates A to pursue their passions and find joy in life.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant context related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It captures Classmates A's journey and motivation to pursue their passion, which is a central theme in the dialogue. The MEMORY also reflects on the supportive role of Classmates B, which aligns with the encouragement seen in the dialogue. It provides a clear connection between their shared values of trying new things and Classmates A's pursuit of happiness. The sentences are naturally phrased and logically connected, providing helpful information to understand the past interactions between the two speakers. However, the memory could be slightly more aligned with specific details from the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which prevents it from receiving a perfect score."
