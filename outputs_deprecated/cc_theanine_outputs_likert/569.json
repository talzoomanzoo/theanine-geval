Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A's enjoyment of building houses and finishing them quickly has led to their interest in taking care of flowers, finding it calming. This interest contrasts with their belief in making money without hurting anyone by covering their tracks carefully. Additionally, Neighbor A's current project to build a new house for Neighbor B is causing them to struggle with focus due to the looming deadline. However, Neighbor B's reminders of Neighbor A's potential to do good things, based on a previous house they built, have sparked a desire in Neighbor A to believe in the positive effects of providing sunlight, water, and love to plants.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information for generating a proper next response. It references Neighbor A's current project of building a house for Neighbor B, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Neighbor A struggles with focus due to a looming deadline. This connection demonstrates the development of their interaction and gives relevant background information that can influence the flow of the conversation.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY also includes information about other interests and beliefs of Neighbor A, such as their enjoyment of building houses quickly and their interest in taking care of flowers. While these details might add depth to Neighbor A's character, they do not directly relate to the immediate conversation about procrastination and focusing on the current project, thus slightly reducing its helpfulness concerning the specific DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY is somewhat relevant and naturally structured, providing some background and continuity, but it lacks a strong direct connection to the immediate conversational context, warranting a score of 3."
