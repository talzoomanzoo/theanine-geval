Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I can't believe I got caught cheating on my taxes. This is such a mess.\nClassmates B: Wait, what? You cheated on your taxes? That's not okay.\nClassmates A: I know, I know. I was just really struggling financially and I thought I could get away with it.\nClassmates B: You can't just cheat and hope to never get caught. That's not how it works.\nClassmates A: Remember when we talked about me wanting to become a professional basketball player?\nClassmates B: Yeah, I remember. So, what does that have to do with cheating on your taxes?\nClassmates A: It's just that I feel like I keep hitting roadblocks in my life. Every time I try to move forward, something happens to set me back. It's really discouraging.\nClassmates B: I understand that it can be tough, but cheating isn't the answer. You have to keep working hard and doing the right thing, even when it's hard.\nClassmates A: On a completely different note, do you remember when I got a job at the local grocery store?\nClassmates B: Yeah, you seemed really happy with that job.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmate B reassures Classmate A that they are all in it together and offers help if needed. - (SameTopic) - Classmates B advises Classmates A to stay focused on their goal, believe in themselves, and ask for help if needed. - (React) - Classmates A believes in hard work and dedication to achieve goals both in basketball and their job.\nClassmate A has tried practicing in front of others but still feels nervous. - (React) - Classmates A has a big dream of becoming a professional basketball player and works hard towards that goal. - (React) - Both classmates have a positive attitude towards each other and their respective goals.\nClassmate B advises Classmate A to take deep breaths, stay confident, and focus on delivery. - (SameTopic) - Classmates B advises Classmates A to stay focused on their goal, believe in themselves, and ask for help if needed. - (React) - Classmates A believes in hard work and dedication to achieve goals both in basketball and their job.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Classmates A",
    "raw_prediction": "I've been putting in extra hours there to make ends meet, but it's been a struggle.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant information related to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly in the part where Classmate B advises Classmate A to stay focused on their goal and work hard. This advice aligns with the ongoing conversation about overcoming struggles and maintaining dedication despite setbacks, which is apparent in Classmate A's discussion about hitting roadblocks and cheating on taxes as a result of financial struggles. The MEMORY also reflects the dynamic of support and encouragement between the speakers, as seen in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which helps provide context for their relationship.\n\nHowever, some parts of the MEMORY mention details that are not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Classmate A feeling nervous about practicing in front of others. While these aspects demonstrate development and interaction between the speakers, they are loosely connected to the current conversation which focuses more on Classmate A's financial struggles and aspirations. Overall, the MEMORY is helpful but could be more directly aligned with the specific issues discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
