Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just can't believe he left me like that. I thought we were happy together.\nNeighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left?\nNeighbors A: No, I haven't. I don't even know what I would say to him. I feel like I'm not enough, like I wasn't good enough for him.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Neighbor B mentions that the neighborhood is more affluent compared to others in the area. This leads to Neighbor A wanting to live in a nicer area. As a result, they enjoy taking walks in the park together and grabbing a bite to eat after their activities. Additionally, Neighbor B offers support and companionship to Neighbor A during their difficult time.\n- Neighbor B mentions that the neighborhood is more affluent compared to others in the area, causing Neighbor A and Neighbor B to catch up outside of their neighborhood. This is particularly important as Neighbor A is grieving the recent loss of their grandmother.\n- Neighbor B mentions that the neighborhood is more affluent compared to others in the area. This common interest leads to Neighbor B being familiar with the park and going there often for walks, which is something they enjoy doing together with Neighbor A. Furthermore, Neighbor A appreciates the emotional support and understanding from Neighbor B during their time of grief.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's understandable to feel that way, but remember that your worth isn't defined by someone else's actions. You deserve someone who appreciates and values you for who you are.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does provide some context that could aid in generating a response, specifically the mention of Neighbor B offering support and companionship to Neighbor A during a difficult time. This aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Neighbor B is showing empathy and concern for Neighbor A. However, the memory largely focuses on the affluence of the neighborhood and activities like walking in the park, which are not directly relevant to Neighbor A's current emotional distress over a breakup. Additionally, the repeated mention of the neighborhood's affluence does not significantly contribute to understanding the dynamics of the conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY is not structured to clearly demonstrate the development or causality of past interactions specific to the breakup issue mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Therefore, while there is some useful information, many parts are not directly beneficial for generating a relevant next response."
