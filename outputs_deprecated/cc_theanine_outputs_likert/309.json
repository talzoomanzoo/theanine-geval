Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I can't believe how honored I am to be part of our class. I feel like we have something special going on here.\nClassmates B:  You're right. Our class definitely has a unique energy about it. What do you think sets us apart from other classes?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate A has been hiding their feelings for Classmate B and finally confesses to being in love with them. Classmate B appreciates Classmate A's honesty about their feelings, but doesn't feel the same way, causing Classmate A to confess their love for Classmate B.\n   \n2. Classmates A and B are both interested in going to the mall near their school. Classmate B feels relieved that they can still be friends with Classmate A, who has been busy with work and hanging out with friends, looking forward to the wedding as a fun night out.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I think it's the way we all support each other and genuinely care about each other's well-being. It creates a strong bond that's hard to find elsewhere.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY does not provide much helpful information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context revolves around a shared sense of pride and special energy within a class, while MEMORY details personal interactions unrelated to this theme. The information regarding Classmate A's confession of love and Classmate B's response doesn't contribute to the current topic about class uniqueness. Similarly, the detail about planning to go to the mall and looking forward to a wedding outing is unrelated. The sentences in MEMORY are not phrased in a way that forms a natural connection or development relevant to the unique energy of the class mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This makes it challenging for a language model to use these past interactions to effectively generate a relevant next response."
