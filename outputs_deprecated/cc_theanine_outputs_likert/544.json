    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, check out this spot I found to camp out for the night. It's perfect!\nClassmates B: Wow, this view is amazing!\nClassmates A: I know, right? And it's completely level and free of any debris. We won't have to worry about rolling off our sleeping pads or anything like that.\nClassmates B: It definitely looks like a great spot to spend the night. How did you manage to find it?\nClassmates A: Just a stroke of luck, I guess. I was exploring the area and stumbled upon it. It's always good to be a little adventurous and explore new places, you never know what you might find.\nClassmates B: That's true. You always seem to find the best spots. Like that time we went camping near the lake and had the whole place to ourselves.\nClassmates A: Oh yeah, that was a great spot too. It's always fun to explore and go on new adventures.\nClassmates B: Definitely. And it's also important to be prepared and bring all the necessary camping gear, like extra food and water, first-aid items, and warm clothes.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates A is actively involved in an action committee focused on improving the community and creating positive change. This involvement inspires Classmate A to seek alternative ways to have fun and make a positive impact in the community. As a result, Classmate A takes the initiative to research topics of interest. Subsequently, Classmate A connects their current allergic reaction to a previous discussion on allergies. \n\nClassmates A is actively involved in an action committee focused on improving the community and creating positive change. This motivates Classmate A to explore new ways to have fun and contribute positively to the community. In response, Classmate A commits to better self-care practices going forward. \n\nClassmates B admires and values Classmates A's community involvement. This admiration prompts Classmate A to explore different avenues for enjoyment and community impact. Acting on this desire, Classmate A proactively engages in researching various topics. This exploration leads Classmate A to link their current allergic reaction to a past conversation about allergies.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Classmates A",
    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely, being prepared is key for a successful camping trip. It's all about finding that balance between adventure and readiness.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nExplanation: The memory provided is not helpful in generating a proper next response based on the dialogue context. The memory focuses on Classmates A's involvement in an action committee and their approach to community improvement and personal self-care, which does not relate to the camping and adventure theme in the dialogue. It also includes repetitive details about Classmate A's response to an allergic reaction, which is irrelevant to the current context. The sentences do not provide a natural connection or development that would aid in continuing the current discussion about camping spots and preparedness. The content lacks relevance and fails to provide any contextual clues that would be beneficial for generating the next response in the current dialogue scenario."
