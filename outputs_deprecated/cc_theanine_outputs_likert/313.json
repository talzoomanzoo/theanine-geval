Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I can't believe how honored I am to be part of our class. I feel like we have something special going on here.\nClassmates B:  You're right. Our class definitely has a unique energy about it. What do you think sets us apart from other classes?\nClassmates A:  I think it's our sense of community. We all support each other and work together to achieve our goals.\nClassmates B:  That's definitely a big factor. And I also think our class has a lot of diversity, which brings new perspectives and ideas to the table.\nClassmates A:  Yes, absolutely. I love hearing everyone's different viewpoints and experiences. It really helps us all grow and learn.\nClassmates B:  And it's not just in the classroom, but also in extracurricular activities and events. We always have a strong turnout and participation.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates B enjoys people watching at the mall.\nClassmates B appreciates Classmates A's honesty about their feelings, but doesn't feel the same way.\nClassmates A has been busy with work and hanging out with friends, looking forward to the wedding as a fun night out.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nThe MEMORY provided does not contain information that is particularly helpful or relevant to generating a proper response in the given DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context talks about the sense of community, diversity, and participation in class activities. Meanwhile, the MEMORY includes unrelated details about Classmates B's hobby of people-watching at the mall, their feelings about Classmates A's honesty, and Classmates A's social life and looking forward to a wedding. These points do not connect or develop any of the ideas discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Therefore, the MEMORY does not contribute much to understanding the conversation's direction or providing meaningful context for continuation."
