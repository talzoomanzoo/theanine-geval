Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I really enjoy being a carpenter. It's a very fulfilling job.\nClassmates B: That's great to hear! How did you get into carpentry?\n\nMEMORY:\n- Classmates B is supportive and encourages Classmates A in their business venture. Classmates A is attending a seminar on starting a business and is excited about applying that knowledge to future plans. Classmate A has always loved singing but never thought it was possible until now.\n- Classmates A appreciates the President's difficult decisions and actions to improve the country's situation. Classmates A is willing to work hard and learn the necessary strategies for business success. Classmate A wants to pursue a dream of becoming a singer.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Classmates A",
    "raw_prediction": "I actually started learning carpentry from my grandfather when I was young. He was a skilled craftsman and inspired me to pursue it as a career.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful context for understanding Classmates A and B's background and interests. Classmates B's supportive nature may align with their interest in Classmate A's job as a carpenter, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, Classmate A's enthusiasm for business and singing ties into their proactive and passionate attitude discussed in the dialogue. However, the MEMORY could be more tightly connected to the topic of carpentry; currently, it offers a broader view of Classmate A's ambitions rather than focusing specifically on their carpentry job, as highlighted in the dialogue. Overall, while the MEMORY provides some context, it could be more directly related to the specific discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
