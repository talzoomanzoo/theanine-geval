Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something.\nClassmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\nClassmates A: Well, it’s been on my mind for a while now and I couldn’t shake it off. I just can't stop thinking about you.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A had doubts about trusting Classmates B due to rumors about their reliability, but they discovered a secret that Classmates B has been keeping. This led Classmate A to recall a moment where they admired Classmate B's courage and strength in sharing a secret, showing their supportive and compassionate nature.\n\n2. Classmates A and B are working on a group project together, and Classmates A tends to overthink things. They appreciated Classmates B's support and advice, especially since Classmate A is very self-critical and struggles with feeling satisfied with their work.\n\n3. Despite initial doubts about trusting Classmates B due to rumors, Classmates A and B are students in the same class and have developed a close relationship with a level of trust between them. Classmate A values setting high standards and is hesitant to lower them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful contextual information that can assist a language model in generating a suitable response for Classmates B. It gives insights into the relationship between Classmates A and B, their previous interactions, and the dynamics in their friendship. For instance, it mentions how Classmate A had initial doubts about Classmate B but grew to admire their courage and strength. It also highlights the mutual support present in their group project work, and the level of trust they've developed despite rumors. These insights can influence the nature of Classmate B's response in the dialogue. Some sentences, however, could be phrased more clearly to better outline their connectedness and development. Nonetheless, the MEMORY effectively captures the essence of past interactions, providing useful context."
