Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately.\nClassmates B: Why is that?\nClassmates A: I want to be smart and I think algebra can help me think more logically and critically.\nClassmates B: That's a good goal to have. Have you noticed any improvements in your thinking since studying algebra?\nClassmates A: Definitely. I feel like I'm able to break down problems and analyze them more effectively.\nClassmates B: It's always rewarding when hard work pays off.\nClassmates A: Yes it is. It reminds me of when I proved my brother wrong in that race. I was so determined to win and it paid off in the end.\nClassmates B: It's great to see that determination and hard work lead to success in different areas of life.\nClassmates A: And even when I felt that pain in my arm, I waited and it eventually went away.\nClassmates B: It's important to listen to your body and take care of yourself.\nClassmates A: Exactly. And sometimes, it's nice to just take a break and enjoy a quiet moment to yourself.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates A faced tough competition in middle school from a fast girl, motivating them to improve. This reminds Classmates B of the importance of enjoying the journey and effort put in, not just focusing on winning. Both classmates value taking moments to relax and appreciate small things.\n\nClassmates B acknowledges Classmates A's determination and competitiveness. This resonates with Classmates A who is struggling with feeling competitive and the need to be the best at everything. Classmates A has not experienced similar pains in the past and is feeling worried about the situation.\n\nClassmates A is always looking to challenge themselves and improve their skills. This prompts Classmates B to offer support and suggests taking a step back to find a balance. They also emphasize the importance of having someone to talk to about personal matters. Additionally, Classmate A emphasizes the importance of self-care and relaxation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Taking breaks and appreciating quiet moments can really help recharge your mind and body. It's important to find that balance between hard work and relaxation.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information that is closely aligned with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Firstly, it reflects the themes of determination, improvement, and self-care, which are central to the conversation between Classmates A and B. Sentences like \"Classmates A faced tough competition in middle school from a fast girl, motivating them to improve\" and \"Classmates B acknowledges Classmates A's determination and competitiveness\" offer relevant background on Classmate A's motivation for studying algebra. This directly ties into discussing improvements and thinking critically, as mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nAdditionally, the MEMORY covers the aspect of relaxing and self-care, which is touched upon at the end of the dialogue, with sentences such as \"Both classmates value taking moments to relax and appreciate small things\" and \"Classmate A emphasizes the importance of self-care and relaxation.\" This is helpful as it reinforces the conversation about listening to one's body and taking a break.\n\nWhile some sentences mentioning Classmate A's competition may not add directly to the flow of the dialogue, they provide depth and perspective, making the MEMORY naturally phrased. However, the portion about Classmate A worrying about pains might not be as directly helpful, as Classmate A's arm pain is noted to have already resolved in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nOverall, MEMORY provides helpful, relevant, and connected sentences that would aid in generating a response by conforming to the themes and context of the dialogue, thus scoring it a 4."
