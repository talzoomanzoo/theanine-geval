Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I'm the boss!\nCo-workers B: Yeah, we know. You don't have to remind us every five minutes.\nCo-workers A: I just want everything to go smoothly and according to plan.\nCo-workers B: I understand that, but it doesn't always have to be your way or the highway.\nCo-workers A: Well, I just think that my way is usually the best way.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A enjoys helping others and takes pride in their work, which Co-worker B appreciates for Co-worker A's competence and effort.\n2. Co-worker B acknowledges Co-worker A's good work ethic and the positive impact it has on the workplace, leading to Co-worker A and Co-worker B excelling at working well with others and resolving issues, and then Co-worker A giving Co-worker B a massage to help them relax.\n3. Co-worker A returned a watch to Co-worker B, making them happy again, just like how Co-worker A had a teddy bear received as a gift from their grandma that they used to carry everywhere.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The information provided in the MEMORY is somewhat beneficial for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, but it is not directly linked to the current conversation. The MEMORY sentences describe a positive working relationship and mutual appreciation between Co-workers A and B, highlighting Co-worker A's competence and the positive impact on the workplace. However, the DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses more on Co-worker A's assertiveness and desire for control, with Co-worker B pushing back against this. The MEMORY lacks direct reference to this dynamic. While the MEMORY mentions competence and good work ethic, it does not specifically relate to the current discussion about leadership style and decision-making approaches. The sentences are generally well-structured and coherent, but they do not provide strong, relevant cues needed to influence or generate a response directly related to the context provided."
