Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to share something with you. I helped out a neighbor in need over the weekend.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B has been supportive and helpful to Classmates A, which made Classmates A appreciate Classmates B's efforts and support. This led to Classmates B advising Classmates A to drive safely to avoid accidents.\n2. Classmates B handled a previous mix-up with the class schedule well, showing responsibility and reliability, which led to Classmates A being concerned about Classmates B's drinking habits and their impact on their health. This concern resulted in Classmates A and B starting as acquaintances and developing a strong friendship, where they value their friendship and feel comfortable talking to each other about anything.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful contextual information about the relationship between Classmates A and B, highlighting the mutual support and friendship they have developed. This information has the potential to inform Classmates A's response, particularly if they wish to mention the support they receive from Classmates B, reinforcing their gratitude or drawing parallels between their own helpful act and their friendship dynamics. However, the MEMORY also contains unrelated details like concerns about drinking habits, which may not directly contribute to generating a relevant response in the given dialogue context. Additionally, the two sentences in the MEMORY could be better structured to clearly demonstrate the development of events and causality. While the MEMORY is somewhat helpful, it could be improved by tightening the connection to the dialogue context and focusing on more directly relevant interactions."
