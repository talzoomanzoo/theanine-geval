Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I can't believe I got caught cheating on my taxes. This is such a mess.\nClassmates B: Wait, what? You cheated on your taxes? That's not okay.\nClassmates A: I know, I know. I was just really struggling financially and I thought I could get away with it.\nClassmates B: You can't just cheat and hope to never get caught. That's not how it works.\nClassmates A: Remember when we talked about me wanting to become a professional basketball player?\nClassmates B: Yeah, I remember. So, what does that have to do with cheating on your taxes?\nClassmates A: It's just that I feel like I keep hitting roadblocks in my life. Every time I try to move forward, something happens to set me back. It's really discouraging.\nClassmates B: I understand that it can be tough, but cheating isn't the answer. You have to keep working hard and doing the right thing, even when it's hard.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A feels nervous despite practicing in front of others, but they have a big dream of becoming a professional basketball player and work hard towards that goal. They believe in hard work and dedication to achieve goals both in basketball and their job, maintaining a positive attitude towards each other and their respective goals.\n2. Classmates A acknowledges the advice to stay confident and focus on delivery, deciding to work at the local grocery store for its proximity to home, flexible hours, and networking opportunities. Classmates B advises Classmates A to stay focused on their goal, believe in themselves, and ask for help if needed.\n3. Classmates B advises Classmate A to take deep breaths, stay confident, and focus on delivery, encouraging them to keep pushing themselves and not let doubts hold them back with a positive attitude towards each other and their respective goals.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Classmates A",
    "raw_prediction": "I know, I need to stay focused on my goals and not let setbacks bring me down.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides relevant information regarding Classmates A's aspiration to become a professional basketball player, which is directly mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT when Classmates A refers to roadblocks in pursuing this goal. The MEMORY includes insights into Classmates A's dedication and the advice they received from Classmates B to stay focused and confident, which aligns with the supportive dialogue in the context. This helps provide background on the dynamic between the two classmates and their encouragement of each other's goals. \n\nHowever, MEMORY also includes details that are less directly related to the immediate issue in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the decision to work at a local grocery store. Although these are phrased naturally and can be useful for a broader understanding, they are not as directly pertinent to the specific tax cheating incident and Classmates A's feelings of discouragement. Therefore, while MEMORY is largely helpful and naturally structured, its relevance could be sharper in relation to the specific dialogue presented. Hence, the score is a 4."
