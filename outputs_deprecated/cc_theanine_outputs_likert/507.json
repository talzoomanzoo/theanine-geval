Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hi there, I was wondering if you'd like to join me for lunch on Tuesday at the school cafeteria.\nCo-workers B: Oh, sure. Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking?\nCo-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for asking me to join you.\nCo-workers A: No problem, it'll be great to catch up. Hey, do you remember when we talked about me being irresponsible a few years ago?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, I remember that conversation. What about it?\nCo-workers A: Well, I wanted to share some good news with you. I've been recently promoted to the night shift and have been doing a great job. I think I've come a long way since those days.\nCo-workers B: That's awesome, congratulations! I'm proud of you and all the hard work you've put in. You've definitely grown and matured in the workplace.\nCo-workers A: Thank you, I appreciate that. But I have to admit, I'm still a bit nervous about being wrong. Remember when we talked about my constantly questioning myself and second-guessing my decisions?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, I remember that. Is there anything specific that's been bothering you?\nCo-workers A: Not really, it's just a general feeling of uncertainty at times. But hey, speaking of uncertainty, do you remember when we talked about my love for singing a while ago?\nCo-workers B: Yes, I do. How's that been going for you?\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A has reflected on the situation that led to Co-worker B's arrest and feels remorseful. Co-worker B has moved on from their arrest and appreciates Co-worker A's concern and change in behavior. They also remind Co-worker A of their progress and potential for success.\n\nCo-worker A's actions in the past led to Co-worker B being arrested. However, Co-worker B has changed their opinion and now compliments Co-worker A's writing skills and reliability as a journalist. This change in behavior makes Co-worker B reassure Co-worker A and encourage them to have more confidence.\n\nCo-worker A's efforts to be more conscious of their impact on others have led them to prioritize reliability in their job. As a result, Co-worker A is nervous about making mistakes in their new position, despite their achievements.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've actually been taking some vocal lessons recently and it's been really fulfilling. I'm starting to feel more confident about my singing abilities.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about Co-worker A's past actions leading to Co-worker B's arrest and Co-worker A's subsequent behavior changes. However, it does not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on Co-worker A's recent promotion and feelings of uncertainty, along with their love for singing. The MEMORY mentions Co-worker A's efforts to be reliable and their nervousness about mistakes, which somewhat connects to Co-worker A's reflection on growth and past behavior. Still, the key elements of the conversational context are not adequately addressed in MEMORY, and some details (e.g., Co-worker B's arrest) are not pertinent to the current dialogue and may confuse the generation of a next response. Thus, MEMORY might require more effective connection or phrasing to be truly beneficial for generating a dialogue response."
