Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I can't believe I got caught cheating on my taxes. This is such a mess.\nClassmates B: Wait, what? You cheated on your taxes? That's not okay.\nClassmates A: I know, I know. I was just really struggling financially and I thought I could get away with it.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B advises Classmates A to stay focused on their goal, believe in themselves, and ask for help if needed. Classmates A believes in hard work and dedication to achieve goals both in basketball and their job. Both classmates have a positive attitude towards each other and their respective goals.\n2.

    "raw_prediction": "You should never cheat, especially on something as serious as taxes. It's important to find legitimate ways to handle financial struggles. How can I support you through this?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some insight into the supportive relationship between Classmates A and B, showcasing Classmate B's encouraging nature and willingness to help and Classmate A's dedication and hard work towards their goals. However, it lacks a direct or relevant connection to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT which revolves around Classmate A cheating on taxes due to financial struggles. The MEMORY mostly focuses on Classmate A's aspirations in basketball and their work at a grocery store, none of which directly address the current turmoil or could guide Classmate B in forming a relevant response to Classmate A's situation with the taxes. Additionally, while the sentences in MEMORY are structured naturally, they do not facilitate understanding of the present situation between the classmates, thus offering limited helpfulness for generating a response to the current context."
