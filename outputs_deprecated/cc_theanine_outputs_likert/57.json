Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today?\nCo-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing.\nCo-workers A: Do you need any help? I don't want you to get overwhelmed.\nCo-workers B: That's really nice of you, but I don't want to burden you with my work.\nCo-workers A: It's not a burden if it's something I can do to support you. Plus, helping you out makes me feel good too.\nCo-workers B: You're right, thank you. You always go above and beyond to help me out.\nCo-workers A: That's what co-workers are for. We're a team and we need to support each other.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of teamwork, remember when you showed me your plans for the future a few months ago? I'm still excited about the idea of working on a project together.\nCo-workers A: Me too! I think we would make a great business partnership.\nCo-workers B: Definitely. It's great to have someone I can trust and rely on in both work and personal matters.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A is grateful to Co-worker B for letting them borrow the horse and is having a great time riding her. This has motivated Co-worker A about the future and made them excited to work with Co-worker B.\nCo-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to prioritize their health, while also being impressed with Co-worker A's well-thought-out plans for their partnership.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that can help in generating an appropriate next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it highlights the mutual support and potential partnership between Co-worker A and Co-worker B. These elements connect to the conversation where they discuss teamwork and future plans. However, the MEMORY also includes details that seem out of place, such as Co-worker A borrowing a horse, which is not connected to the immediate dialogue and could lead to confusion. While the MEMORY captures some aspects of their relationship, it could be more focused and consistent with the current dialogue to improve clarity and relevance."
