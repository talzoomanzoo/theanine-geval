Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I really enjoy public speaking. It's such a great way to connect with people and convey a message.\nCo-workers B: I can see that you're a natural speaker. Your words always have a way of making people feel comfortable and confident.\nCo-workers A: Thank you! I've been practicing for a while now, and I'm glad that it shows.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of skills, you always present a compelling argument in debates. I remember when you presented your evidence in court, it was so persuasive.\nCo-workers A: Yes, I think it's important to back up your claims with facts and figures. It helps to convince the judge or the audience that you're right.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of convincing people, have you ever been in a physical altercation before?\nCo-workers A: Yes, unfortunately. But that doesn't mean I'm a danger to people. I just don't back down from a fight when I'm standing up for what's right.\nCo-workers B: That's understandable. Speaking of standing up for what's right, do you remember when you asked Karen for money and she was hesitant at first?\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I remember. But she eventually gave me the cash, and I was able to take care of what I needed to.\nCo-workers B: That's good. And speaking of taking care of things, your carpentry skills are amazing. I loved the house you built for me last year.\nCo-workers A: Thanks! I really love building houses. It's a great feeling to take a blueprint and turn it into someone's dream home.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's craftsmanship in building a house for them. \nCo-worker A's confidence in their argument is praised by Co-worker B, who admires their courage to defend their beliefs. Co-worker A's reputation may have influenced Karen's initial hesitation to lend them money. \nCo-worker B is pleased with the house built by Co-worker A and is thinking about adding a deck to it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Co-workers B",
    "raw_prediction": "I was thinking about adding a deck to the house you built for me. It would be a great addition for enjoying the outdoors.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides useful information that directly corresponds to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Co-worker B's appreciation of Co-worker A's craftsmanship in building a house and their confidence in arguments are key points mentioned in both the dialogue and memory. These provide a language model with significant contextual cues about the professional relationship and mutual respect between the co-workers, which is helpful for generating a coherent next response.\n\nHowever, while the details about Co-worker A's reputation potentially affecting Karen's hesitation to lend money are interesting, they are not directly discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This slightly lowers the MEMORY's alignment with the dialogue, preventing a perfect score. Additionally, the mention of Co-worker B contemplating adding a deck doesn't tie into the ongoing dialogue or affect the immediate conversation unless further explored in subsequent dialogue. \n\nOverall, MEMORY captures major aspects of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT well and offers coherent and structured content that remains useful, hence the score of 4."
