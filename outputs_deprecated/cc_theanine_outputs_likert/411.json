Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm really excited about finding a buyer for my product. I think it has a lot of potential.\nNeighbors B: That's great to hear, what kind of product is it?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A and Neighbors B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as they enjoy having coffee and chatting together. Neighbors A noticed that Neighbors B's dog has been missing for a few days.\nNeighbors A acknowledged the need to work harder, be nicer to colleagues, and improve their behavior. Neighbors B advised Neighbors A to change their behavior at work and be a responsible adult. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's efforts to change and become a better version of themselves. Neighbors B appreciated Neighbors A's support during this difficult situation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information about the relationship between Neighbors A and B, which can be beneficial for generating a relevant response. The memory indicates that they have a friendly and supportive relationship, which aligns with the positive tone in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the specific details about Neighbors B's dog being missing and the advice on behavior changes are not directly relevant to the current conversation about a product. The information about their supportive relationship is useful context, but it doesn't provide significant insight into the DIALOGUE CONTEXT itself, which centers around Neighbors A's excitement about a potential buyer for their product. The sentences are generally well-structured, but the relevance to the current context is limited, leading to a mid-range score."
