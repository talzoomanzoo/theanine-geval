Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: It's great to have friends who can help each other out, isn't it?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A thanked Neighbors B for the suggestion of the necklace and stumbled upon Neighbors B's shop. Neighbors B offered to help Neighbors A with the apology process. Neighbors A has a picture of the dress on their phone and will show it to Neighbors B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Neighbors B",
    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely, I'm glad we can support each other. Let me see the picture of the dress you're thinking of wearing for the apology dinner.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY details past interactions where Neighbors B suggested a necklace and offered help with an apology process, which suggests a supportive relationship. Neighbors A also plans to show a picture of a dress to Neighbors B, indicating ongoing communication. These elements highlight a cooperative dynamic that aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about having friends who help each other. The information is relevant and naturally connected, aiding in understanding the relationship between the speakers. However, more explicit connections to the concept of friendship or helping each other out directly could improve clarity and direct relevancy."
