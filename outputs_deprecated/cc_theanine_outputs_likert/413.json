    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm really excited about finding a buyer for my product. I think it has a lot of potential.\nNeighbors B: That's great to hear, what kind of product is it?\nNeighbors A: It's a new type of workout equipment that's designed to be more efficient than traditional equipment. I've been working on it for months now and I really think it's going to take off.\nNeighbors B: Wow, that sounds interesting. Have you started looking for potential buyers?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A acknowledges the need to work harder, be nicer to colleagues, and improve their behavior. Neighbors B advised Neighbors A to change their behavior at work and be a responsible adult. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's efforts to change and become a better version of themselves. Neighbors B appreciated Neighbors A's support during this difficult situation.\n\nNeighbors A acknowledges the need to work harder, be nicer to colleagues, and improve their behavior. Neighbors A is having issues at work, such as not pulling their weight and being rude to colleagues. Neighbors A and Neighbors B have a friendly and supportive relationship, as they enjoy having coffee and chatting together. Neighbors B appreciated Neighbors A's support during this difficult situation.\n\nNeighbors B expresses a desire for Neighbors A to succeed and emphasizes the importance of treating others with respect and putting in effort at work. Neighbors B advised Neighbors A to change their behavior at work and be a responsible adult. Neighbors B is supportive of Neighbors A's efforts to change and become a better version of themselves. Neighbors B appreciated Neighbors A's support during this difficult situation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, I've started reaching out to some fitness centers and trainers to gauge their interest. I'm hopeful that the product will be well-received in the market.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provided does not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Neighbors A's excitement over their new product and the search for potential buyers. Instead, the MEMORY focuses on Neighbors A's need to improve behavior at work, and Neighbors B's support and advice regarding Neighbors A's workplace behavior. While the MEMORY does offer insight into the supportive nature of the relationship between the two neighbors, it lacks relevant information that would explicitly aid in generating the next response about the workout equipment and its potential buyers. The MEMORY fails to demonstrate development or causality related to the current dialogue topic. Additionally, the repetitions in MEMORY don't add any new helpful context. Although it is well-structured, the information does not provide much help for continuing the conversation about the product."
