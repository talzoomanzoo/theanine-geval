Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager!\nCo-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge.\nCo-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail.\nCo-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of new products, remember when you used to fantasize about being a great leader?\nCo-workers A: Ha, yeah. That seems like ages ago.\nCo-workers B: Well, now you can finally take on that leadership role and make your dreams a reality.\nCo-workers A: That's true. It's amazing how life works out sometimes. But it hasn't always been smooth sailing. Remember when I was really stressed about you not liking me?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, I remember. But we worked through it, didn't we?\nCo-workers A: We definitely did. And it taught me to just take things one step at a time, like I am with this new role.\nCo-workers B: Exactly, and I'm sure you'll apply that same mentality to your training as well. I remember you were really dedicated to it a couple of years ago.\nCo-workers A: Oh yeah, I still try to keep up with it whenever I can. It's important to stay physically and mentally fit, especially with this new job.\nCo-workers B: Just don't let your anger get the better of you again. Remember when you exploded and started throwing things?\nCo-workers A: Ugh, let's not even go there. My parents gave me a good scolding for that.\nCo-workers B: Well, all that matters is that you learn from your mistakes and keep moving forward. And hey, you're doing just that with this promotion.\nCo-workers A: Absolutely. Thanks for always being a supportive colleague, it means a lot to me.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker B believes in Co-worker A's leadership potential and emphasizes the importance of mutual support in the workplace. Co-worker B shows support for Co-worker A's growth and advises taking small steps in conversations. \n\nCo-worker A dreams of becoming a great leader and stresses the importance of effective communication.

    "raw_prediction": "You've worked hard for this promotion, and I have no doubt you'll excel in your new role. Just remember to stay true to yourself and your leadership style.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It accurately captures the essence of the interactions between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, such as Co-worker B's belief in Co-worker A's leadership potential and the theme of mutual support. It also highlights Co-worker A's aspirations to become a great leader, their past emotional challenges, and their progress in gaining confidence. The MEMORY is well-structured and demonstrates a clear development of the two co-workers' relationship, which is useful for understanding their interactions. However, there are some areas that could be made more explicit, such as detailing past incidents beyond generalizations, which would make the MEMORY even more specific and beneficial."
