Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm sorry you had to hear me swear like that. I shouldn't have lost my temper like that.\nNeighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset?\nNeighbors A: It was just something that happened at work. My boss was being unreasonable and I couldn't take it anymore.\nNeighbors B: That's understandable. Have you tried talking to your boss about it?\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I have, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I just feel like I'm stuck in a dead-end job.\nNeighbors B: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you considered looking for a new job?\nNeighbors A: I have, but with the current job market, it's really tough. Plus, I don't have a lot of experience in other fields.\nNeighbors B: Well, I'll keep an ear out for any job openings that might be a good fit for you. In the meantime, maybe try finding ways to de-stress after work? I find that exercise helps me when I'm feeling frustrated.\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea. Maybe I'll go for a run later. Thanks for being a supportive neighbor.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A and B share a common value of maintaining clean outside spaces and building a sense of community through helping each other. This sense of mutual support is evident in their interactions, where they are supportive and understanding of each other's mistakes. Additionally, Neighbors A emphasizes the importance of recognizing and appreciating acts of kindness, reflecting the gratitude they have for each other's help. In a past experience, Neighbors B remembers when their tree house was destroyed due to neglect, highlighting the importance of proper care. This memory is contrasted with the mutual support shown between Neighbors A and B, where they help each other with tasks like lawn care and grocery shopping.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "You're welcome, happy to help. Running can really clear your mind. Just remember, it's important to take care of yourself during tough times.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY contains some helpful information that could aid in generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, it highlights the mutual support and understanding between Neighbors A and B, which aligns with the supportive nature of the conversation in the context. However, much of the memory focuses on their shared value of maintaining clean spaces and community building, which is less relevant to the current topic of job frustrations and stress relief discussed in the context. Additionally, while the memory does mention a past experience of a tree house being destroyed, this detail does not add much to the understanding of the current dialogue. Overall, the MEMORY provides some useful background on the neighbors' relationship, but could benefit from more direct relevance to the specific situation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
