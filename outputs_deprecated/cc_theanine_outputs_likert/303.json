Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I marked the boundary line with a pen on the wall so that we can both be clear about where my property ends and your property begins.\nNeighbors B: Oh, okay. I didn't realize there was any confusion about that.\nNeighbors A: Well, I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page. I don't want any misunderstandings in the future.\nNeighbors B: I understand. Is there anything else we should do to make sure we're clear about this?\nNeighbors A: I don't think so, but if you have any other suggestions, I'm open to hearing them.\nNeighbors B: No, I think the line is a good idea. It's clear and simple.\nNeighbors A: Great. Hey, speaking of lines and boundaries, remember when we talked about my promotion at work? I had to set some clear boundaries with my team about what I expected from them.\nNeighbors B: Yeah, I remember. How did that go?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A went to a concert with Neighbor B and they had a great time. This memory is brought up when Neighbor A mentions their new job as a secretary at a small marketing agency.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It went well, actually. Setting those boundaries really helped improve communication and productivity.",
    "prediction": "1. \n\nThe MEMORY provided does not contain information that is helpful or relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY talks about a concert and a new job as a secretary, which does not aid in generating a response to the current conversation about boundary lines and setting boundaries at work. It lacks any development or connection to the topics under discussion in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, failing to offer essential contextual cues for a language model to use in formulating a proper next response. The MEMORY also does not demonstrate any form of past interaction development relevant to the ongoing conversation, making it unhelpful for the language model."
