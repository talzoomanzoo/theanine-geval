Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Mentee, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, I'm feeling really lonely in this new city. I don't know anyone yet and I miss my old friends.\nMentor: I understand that starting over can be tough, Mentee. But remember, this is also an opportunity for you to meet new people and make new connections.\nMentee: Yes, I know, but it's easier said than done. I feel like everyone already has their own group of friends here.\nMentor: That's just a fear, Mentee. You can join clubs or organizations that interest you to meet like-minded people. You could also start volunteering around the city to meet new people.\nMentee: Those are good suggestions, Mentor. I'll consider joining a club or volunteering.\nMentor: And remember, it's also important to keep in touch with your old friends. You can schedule video calls or even plan a visit back home.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Mentor acknowledges the Mentee's work in advocacy for women and girls and praises their dedication to their values, causing Mentee to agree to go back to the store to make things right and express gratitude for the mentor's advice.\n\n2. Mentor reassures Mentee that many students feel the same way and that everyone works at their own pace in reaction to the Mentor believing the Mentee's work has been influential and that they will continue to make an impact in the world.\n\n3. The Mentee hopes to inspire others to join the cause of gender equality and fighting discrimination, wanting to express gratitude for the Mentor's guidance and support throughout the decision-making process. This leads to Mentee feeling overwhelmed with the college application process, which is on the same topic as Mentee taking shoes from the store without paying because they couldn't afford them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you, Mentor. I appreciate your support and advice. I'll make an effort to stay connected with my old friends while also exploring new opportunities to meet people in the city.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nThe MEMORY content largely revolves around themes of advocacy, gender equality, and specific past incidents such as the Mentee taking shoes from a store without paying. These topics are unrelated to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on feelings of loneliness, making new friends, and adjusting to a new city. Additionally, the sentences in MEMORY do not highlight any past interactions related to the current conversation and are structured around different subjects. The lack of relevant connections, causalities, or development between the two contexts makes the MEMORY unhelpful for generating a meaningful continuation for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Thus, the MEMORY offers minimal beneficial input for guiding the next response in this dialogue situation."
