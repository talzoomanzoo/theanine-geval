Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel really fulfilled as a leader and guide. Helping others gives me a sense of purpose.\nCo-workers B: I can see that. You always seem to know just what to do to make people feel better.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A wants to ensure the best production for the audience and hopes to find a compromise with the director.\n2. Co-worker B emphasizes the importance of acknowledging privileges and using them to make the world a better place.\n3. Co-worker A had a positive experience with a commander who helped them feel safe.\n4. Co-worker B values finding fulfillment in work, pursuing hobbies, making a difference in the world, and building relationships with others.\n5. Co-worker A believes that making money can lead to fulfillment and provide the freedom to pursue hobbies and interests.\n6. Co-worker A values making money and is interested in opportunities to do so.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It's important to me to make a positive impact and create a supportive environment for others.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information about Co-worker A and Co-worker B, which could potentially help in generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, statements 4 and 5 align with Co-worker B's appreciation of fulfillment and Co-worker A’s sense of purpose, respectively. However, the connections between the sentences describing the past interactions of Co-worker A and Co-worker B aren't very clearly developed. Sentences such as those on privileges and money (sentences 2, 5, and 6) seem somewhat disconnected from the dialogue context, giving less help for understanding two speakers’ past interactions concerning the current topic of leadership and helping others. Additionally, some sentences do not appear directly relevant to the dialogue context, reducing the overall helpfulness. Therefore, while MEMORY contains some useful insights, it lacks strong cohesion and direct relevance consistently throughout, resulting in an average score."
