Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey, can you keep a secret?\nNeighbors B: Of course, what's up?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors B is interested in Neighbors A's cooking and asks about the vegetables and quinoa preparation. Neighbors A enjoys cooking and made roasted vegetables and quinoa for dinner. Neighbors A and B joke about the fun aspects of using telekinesis to surprise people. Neighbors A and B share a dream of developing telekinetic abilities together in the future. Neighbors B is excited and supportive of Neighbors A's new ability. Neighbor B suggests that new skills could lead to new opportunities in Neighbor A's current job or future career. Neighbor B offers support and suggests planning a dinner to celebrate Neighbor A's new adventures in learning. Neighbors A is overwhelmed but also excited about their new ability. Neighbor A feels there is no room for growth or new projects at their current job.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I think I might have discovered a way to enhance my telekinetic abilities even further.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information that could be helpful for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It reveals that Neighbors A and B have a close relationship where they discuss personal topics and share dreams, such as developing telekinetic abilities together. It also shows that Neighbors B is supportive and enthusiastic about Neighbors A's new developments, which aligns with the context where Neighbors A is about to share a secret. This background helps inform the context of the secret and suggests Neighbors B's likely supportive reaction. However, the MEMORY includes some unrelated details, such as cooking, which do not directly pertain to the immediate context of sharing a secret. Despite this, the memory is mostly well-structured and relevant, supporting a high score."
