Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just can't believe he left me like that. I thought we were happy together.\nNeighbors B: I'm so sorry, Neighbor A. Have you talked to him since he left?\nNeighbors A: No, I haven't. I don't even know what I would say to him. I feel like I'm not enough, like I wasn't good enough for him.\nNeighbors B: That's not true, Neighbor A. You are an amazing person and you deserve someone who appreciates you for who you are.\nNeighbors A: I just feel so lost right now. I don't know how to move on from this.\nNeighbors B: It's going to take time, but you will get through this. Do you want to talk about how you're feeling or do something to take your mind off of things?\nNeighbors A: Maybe both? I just feel so overwhelmed and I don't know what to do.\nNeighbors B: How about we go for a walk and you can talk to me about everything that's been on your mind?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A recently moved to a new neighborhood and feels safer and happier there. Neighbor A appreciates the emotional support and understanding from Neighbor B during their time of grief.\nNeighbor A and Neighbor B are neighbors who catch up outside of their neighborhood. Neighbors A and Neighbors B like to grab a bite to eat together after their activities. Neighbor B is offering support and companionship to Neighbor A during their difficult time.\nNeighbor A has a bit of a drive to get to the park where they are meeting with Neighbor B. Neighbors A and Neighbors B enjoy going for walks together, especially to the park. Neighbor A finds solace in nature and believes that it helps in coping with their emotions.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds like a good idea. A walk in the park and a chat would be nice right now.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides several pieces of relevant information that can aid in generating a response for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Firstly, it notes the emotional support and companionship that Neighbor B offers to Neighbor A, which is consistent with the supportive conversation in the dialogue. Secondly, MEMORY includes details about Neighbor A's move to a new neighborhood and their feelings of safety and happiness there, which reflects Neighbor A's current struggles and need for comfort. Finally, the mention of walks and finding solace in nature aligns with Neighbor B's suggestion to go for a walk, demonstrating their familiarity, shared interests, and understanding of what might benefit Neighbor A during this difficult time.\n\nThese connections to the dialogue context are helpful in ensuring that the developed response captures the established relationship dynamics and offers relevant emotional support, making the MEMORY quite useful. However, while the information is relevant and well-structured, it does not provide specific new developments or insights into Neighbor A's relationship situation, which would further enhance its helpfulness. Hence, the score is a 4 rather than a perfect 5."
