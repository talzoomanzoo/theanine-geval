Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Wife, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway?\nWife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go?\nHusband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city.\nWife: Oh, that sounds like a perfect idea! It will be nice to have some peace and quiet for a change.\nHusband: Yes, and we could cook our meals together, go for a hike, and just relax. What do you think?\nWife: That sounds lovely, husband. I'm really looking forward to it.\nHusband: Great. I'll start looking for rental cabins right away. I know this may sound impulsive, but I'm really excited to make this happen.\nWife: Don't worry, husband, it's not impulsive. You always follow through with your plans, and I believe this will be a wonderful experience for both of us.\nHusband: Thank you, wife. And, I want to apologize for the time I left without waiting for you. I know I promised to wait, and I should have kept my word.\n\nMEMORY:\nThe husband's excitement about his long-awaited plans drives him to take action and involve his wife in future plans. The wife expresses her past disappointment when the husband left without her, emphasizing the importance of keeping promises. The husband's dedication to his plans excites him, and both husband and wife are looking forward to their future together.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thank you for apologizing, husband. I appreciate it. Let's focus on the present and enjoy our upcoming getaway together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides helpful information by capturing the dynamics of the couple's interaction and their focus on future plans. It highlights the husband's excitement and dedication to following through with his plans, as well as the wife's past disappointment which is relevant to the current context as the husband is apologizing for a past incident. The MEMORY also effectively emphasizes the importance of keeping promises, which aligns with the wife's trust in her husband's ability to follow through with their weekend plans. However, it does not fully elaborate on the development or causal connections between all details in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which prevents it from scoring a 5. Overall, the MEMORY is structured in a way that provides useful contextual cues for generating a response."
