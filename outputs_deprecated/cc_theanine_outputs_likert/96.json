    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I have some exciting plans for the future that I wanted to share with you.\nClassmates B: Oh really? What are they?\nClassmates A: Well, I was thinking that we could work on a project together and maybe even become business partners.\nClassmates B: Wow, that sounds amazing! What kind of project are you thinking about?\nClassmates A: I was thinking about starting a marketing agency specialized in social media.\nClassmates B: That's a great idea! I'd love to work with you on that. We could really make a difference in the industry.\nClassmates A: Yes, exactly! And I think our skills complement each other's so well.\nClassmates B: I totally agree. You're so creative and outgoing, while I'm more analytical and detail-oriented.\nClassmates A: It's like we were meant to work together, right?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate A's encouragement for Classmate B to initiate conversations and be friendly led to Classmate B appreciating Classmate A's gesture of buying coffee, which in turn made Classmate A agree to try the suggestion and thank Classmate B for it. This caused Classmate B to encourage Classmate A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n\n2. Both Classmate A and Classmate B enjoying socializing and going out to parties together caused Classmate A to enjoy treating their friends to coffee, which further led to Classmate A and B sharing memories of buying coffee from Starbucks and enjoying it together.\n\n3. Classmate B admiring Classmate A's outgoing nature and wanting to be more like them made Classmate A realize the importance of balancing responsibilities, which changed Classmate A's approach by mentioning lacking discipline, focus, and motivation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely, our strengths would definitely make a great team. I'm excited to see where this partnership takes us.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides somewhat helpful information but lacks direct relevance and clear connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY details past interactions and traits of the classmates, such as Classmate A's outgoing nature and Classmate B's analytical side, which are briefly touched upon in the dialogue. However, the MEMORY does not specifically enhance the understanding or development of the current conversation about starting a marketing agency together. While the sentences are naturally structured and hint at their complementary skills and friendly interaction, they do not directly contribute to the business partnership context. Therefore, the MEMORY provides moderate helpfulness without offering significant contextual cues or development related to the immediate plans discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
