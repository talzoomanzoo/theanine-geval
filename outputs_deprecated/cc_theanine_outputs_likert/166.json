Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Mentee, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Thank you for finding my glasses for me, Mentor. I always seem to misplace them.\nMentor: Not a problem, Mentee. I'm glad I could help. \nMentee: This actually reminds me of when I was struggling with substance abuse. I would often lose things or forget where I put things because of my drinking. It's amazing how much clearer my mind is now that I'm sober.\nMentor: That's a great observation, Mentee. Sobriety can definitely improve your cognitive abilities and overall wellbeing. It's amazing how much substance abuse can hold us back in life.\nMentee: Yeah, it's definitely a difficult journey, but I'm grateful for the support systems I have in place. Like you, Mentor. Your experience and guidance have been invaluable to me.\nMentor: I'm happy to be there for you, Mentee. It's been great seeing you grow and develop over the years.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentee credits Mentor for their help in achieving sobriety and expresses gratitude for the support, which causes Mentor to be proud of Mentee for making positive changes and taking control of their life. \n2. Mentor has been supportive of Mentee's journey to sobriety, which makes Mentee want to make a name for themselves in the industry and believes learning from Mentor will help them achieve that.\n3. Mentor advises the Mentee to be gentle with themselves when they slip back into old patterns, which is the same topic as Mentor acknowledging Mentee's achievements and providing ongoing support and guidance.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: MEMORY provides an understanding of the relationship and past interactions between Mentor and Mentee, which is relevant to generating a response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The first sentence in MEMORY captures Mentee's sentiment of gratitude and how it positively influences Mentor. Similarly, the second sentence indicates Mentee's aspirations and how they tie back to Mentor's support, although not directly mentioned in the context. The third sentence offers insight into Mentor's supportive approach during Mentee's challenging times, although it does not align precisely with the context. Overall, MEMORY is helpful in providing background information for generating a response as it relates to the perceived supportive dynamic and growth observed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, certain components in MEMORY, particularly the second sentence, seem less directly relevant to the current context, resulting in a slight reduction from a perfect score."
