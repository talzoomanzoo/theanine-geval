Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker B is supportive and encourages Co-worker A to prioritize their health. Co-worker B is supportive and glad that Co-worker A is okay. Co-worker B was surprised to learn about Co-worker A's past struggles.\n2. Co-worker A has been feeling off lately. Co-worker A is grateful to Co-worker B for letting them borrow the horse and is having a great time riding her. Co-worker A expressed gratitude for the horse that Co-worker B gave them, mentioning it brings joy and happiness.\n3. Co-worker B offers help and support to Co-worker A. Co-worker B is generous and allows Co-worker A to ride any of their horses anytime. Co-worker A expressed gratitude for the horse that Co-worker B gave them, mentioning it brings joy and happiness.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some contextual information about the relationship between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, specifically regarding Co-worker B's supportive nature and their generosity in allowing Co-worker A to ride their horse. However, the MEMORY lacks direct relevance to the question \"how's your workload today\" posed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The information about the horse and Co-worker B’s supportive nature doesn't contribute much to constructing a suitable response for the current interaction about workload. Most sentences don't offer specific, helpful insights into the current context or how Co-worker A’s past interactions with Co-worker B might influence their current workplace discussion. Therefore, the helpfulness of the MEMORY in generating a fitting response to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is limited."
