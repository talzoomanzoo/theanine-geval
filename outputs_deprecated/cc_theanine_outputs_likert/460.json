Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something.\nClassmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\nClassmates A: Well, it’s been on my mind for a while now and I couldn’t shake it off. I just can't stop thinking about you.\nClassmates B: Oh, really?\nClassmates A: Yes, really. I know we've been friends for a while now, but I feel like there may be something more between us.\nClassmates B: Hmm, I never thought about it that way. But I can’t deny that we have a great connection.\nClassmates A: Exactly! I just feel like we could be more than just friends. If it's something you're open to, of course.\nClassmates B: I get what you’re saying,. And to be honest, I’ve had similar thoughts lately. I’m definitely open to exploring this.\nClassmates A: I’m so relieved to hear that. I was worried that I might be crossing a line by expressing my feelings.\nClassmates B: No, not at all. I’m glad you did. It takes courage to express your true feelings. \nClassmates A: Yeah, I guess it does. It’s just that I’ve been hurt before, and I don’t want to lose you as a friend too.\nClassmates B: I understand your concerns,. but I think we can make this work. We've already built a strong foundation of friendship, which is important for any relationship.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B share a supportive friendship, offering help and admiration during stressful times, based on their experiences working on a group project together.\n2. Classmates A values maintaining high standards and is reluctant to compromise them, reflecting the trust and closeness in their relationship while working on a group project.\n3. Classmates A appreciates Classmates B's support and advice, especially in dealing with overthinking tendencies, promoting self-compassion and balance in striving for excellence.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I agree, our friendship is a great starting point for exploring something more. I'm excited to see where this could lead us.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information which supports the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It indicates that Classmates A and B share a supportive and strong foundation of friendship, as seen from their experiences during a group project. This mirrors their conversation where they discuss the potential for a deeper relationship built on their existing friendship. The MEMORY provides insight into Classmates A's tendency to overthink and their appreciation for Classmates B's support, which adds depth to the context of the dialogue, where Classmates A is worried about crossing a line. Overall, the MEMORY contains helpful information with a natural connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, aiding in generating an appropriate response. However, it does not contain highly specific details or developments directly linked to romantic feelings, which prevents it from scoring a 5."
