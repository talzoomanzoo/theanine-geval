Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Mentee, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nMentee: Mentor, have you ever tried to imagine what it would be like to think like someone else?\nMentor: Yes, I have. It's a great way to better understand and empathize with others.\nMentee: That's exactly what I thought. I've been trying to imagine what personY is thinking lately. It's been helping me to understand their perspective a bit better.\nMentor: That's a great approach. Putting ourselves in someone else's shoes can help us see things from a different angle and see where they're coming from.\nMentee: Exactly. And it also helps me to be more compassionate towards them. I think it's important for us to be more understanding and supportive of each other, especially in difficult times.\nMentor: I agree completely. It's important to be kind and compassionate towards others, especially when they may be going through something challenging.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Mentee is grateful for Mentor's support and is motivated to make a positive impact in people's lives by taking the advice seriously.\n2. Mentor advises Mentee to listen to their body and create a bedtime routine for better sleep, while also wanting to break free from the oppressive rules of the cult.\n3. Mentee expresses gratitude towards Mentor, plans to escape to a shelter for cult survivors, and considers volunteering at a religious organization, all while Mentor suggests approaching teaching religion with an open heart.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've found that empathy and understanding go a long way in building stronger relationships and creating a more supportive environment for everyone involved.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information that is somewhat relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the mentee expressing gratitude towards the mentor and considering positive actions like volunteering, which could connect to the mentee's interest in understanding others. However, the memory also includes unrelated and potentially distracting elements, such as mention of cults, escape plans, and breaking free from oppressive rules. These do not connect clearly to the current dialogue context focused on empathy and understanding others' perspectives. Overall, MEMORY is not naturally structured to clearly demonstrate the development or causality of past interactions, causing the mentoring context to be muddled rather than clarified."
