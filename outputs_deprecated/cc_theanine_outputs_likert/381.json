Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to share something with you. I helped out a neighbor in need over the weekend.\nClassmates B: That's really kind of you. What did you do to help?\nClassmates A: She was moving and needed some extra hands to pack up her things and load them onto a truck. So I spent most of the day helping her out.\nClassmates B: Wow, that's really generous of you. I'm sure your neighbor really appreciated it.\nClassmates A: I hope so. I just felt like it was the right thing to do. I know if I were in that situation, I would appreciate any help I could get.\nClassmates B: Absolutely. It's important to be there for each other, especially in tough times.\nClassmates A: Yes, and it feels good to make a difference in someone's life, even if it's just in a small way.\nClassmates B: Definitely. It's the small acts of kindness that can make the biggest impact. Remembers when we talked about how I made sure the mix-up won't happen again? That was because I wanted to make a small impact, like you did for your neighbor.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A appreciates Classmates B's efforts and support, leading to Classmates B being supportive and helpful to Classmates A, which then results in Classmates B advising Classmates A to drive safely to avoid accidents.\n2. Classmates A appreciates Classmates B's efforts and support, as well as the support and friendship of Classmates B, where Classmates B was initially worried about Classmates A going out with friends but they value each other's opinions.\n3. Classmates A appreciates Classmates B's efforts and support, which motivates Classmates B to be supportive and helpful to Classmates A, and also leads to Classmates B initially being worried about Classmates A going out with friends but they value each other's opinions.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I remember that conversation. It's always the little things that count the most. It's great that we can support each other in different ways.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some information about the relationship between Classmates A and B, such as Classmates A appreciating Classmates B's efforts, support, and friendship. However, the sentences are repetitive, with slightly varying phrasing, and they don't directly connect or provide clear context for the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where the focus is on Classmate A helping a neighbor. Although the MEMORY establishes a generally supportive relationship between the two speakers, it lacks specific details or past interactions that clearly tie into or enhance the current conversation's topic. The information is not structured in a way that naturally leads to the current discussion about helping out a neighbor, specifically. This absence of a direct link in the MEMORY to the present dialogue context limits its helpfulness for generating a coherent next response."
