    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something.\nClassmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\nClassmates A: Well, it’s been on my mind for a while now and I couldn’t shake it off. I just can't stop thinking about you.\nClassmates B: Oh, really?\nClassmates A: Yes, really. I know we've been friends for a while now, but I feel like there may be something more between us.\nClassmates B: Hmm, I never thought about it that way. But I can’t deny that we have a great connection.\nClassmates A: Exactly! I just feel like we could be more than just friends. If it's something you're open to, of course.\nClassmates B: I get what you’re saying,. And to be honest, I’ve had similar thoughts lately. I’m definitely open to exploring this.\nClassmates A: I’m so relieved to hear that. I was worried that I might be crossing a line by expressing my feelings.\nClassmates B: No, not at all. I’m glad you did. It takes courage to express your true feelings. \nClassmates A: Yeah, I guess it does. It’s just that I’ve been hurt before, and I don’t want to lose you as a friend too.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A offered to provide support and stress-relieving massages to Classmates B, causing Classmates A to want to offer help and support to Classmates B, which made Classmate A recall a moment where they admired Classmate B's courage and strength in sharing a secret, showing their supportive and compassionate nature.\n\n2. Classmates A had doubts about trusting Classmates B due to rumors about their reliability, which led to Classmates A and B being supportive friends who look out for each other during stressful times, and made Classmates B feel relieved to have someone to confide in about the secret.\n\n3. Classmates B assures Classmates A that they will do their part in the group project, prompting Classmates A to tend to overthink things and appreciate Classmates B's support and advice, and leading Classmate B to encourage self-compassion and finding a balance between striving for excellence and being kind to oneself.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some helpful background information that can be linked to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but lacks clear direct connections. The context revolves around Classmates A and B expressing feelings beyond friendship and mentions of trust, support, and expressing courage. MEMORY contains some potentially relevant elements, like mentions of support and appreciation for courage, which are related to the dialogue, but it doesn't explicitly mention romantic feelings or a shift towards a deeper relationship. The memories provide context for the supportive friendship between Classmates A and B and include elements such as trust, courage, and supportiveness, which align with some themes of the dialogue context. However, the details about specific events and the structure of the sentences might not directly aid generating the next response in the ongoing conversation about romantic feelings. The connections and developments are present but not entirely aligned, hence a mid-range score."
