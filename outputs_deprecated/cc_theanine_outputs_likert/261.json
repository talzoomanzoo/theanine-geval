Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Wife, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I hung up some more lights and candles today.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The husband enjoys hanging out with his friend, finding happiness and contentment in their company, and appreciates being outdoors in the nice weather.\n2. The husband feels supported by his wife in pursuing activities that bring him joy outside of work and family life, and he believes in cherishing meaningful connections like the one he has with his friend.\n3. The husband's strong faith, influenced by his Christian upbringing, drives his involvement in various church ministries, and he is grateful for it.\n4. The husband values trustworthy companionship and looks forward to collaborating on the podcast project, finding happiness and contentment in being with his friend and enjoying the beautiful weather.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds lovely! It's great that you're making our home even cozier with those lights and candles.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful context for the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While there isn't a direct reference to hanging lights and candles or a related activity, the memory does emphasize the husband's enjoyment of hobbies and finding happiness and contentment in activities and relationships outside his work and family life. This indirectly supports the husband expressing satisfaction with things like hanging lights and candles, which can be considered an activity he enjoys. However, the information about the husband's faith and church involvement, while naturally phrased, doesn't directly relate to the current dialogue context, making the memory less tailored to generating a precise response. Overall, the MEMORY is somewhat relevant and naturally structured, but not entirely focused on enhancing the specific context of the dialogue."
