Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, how are you feeling today?\nClassmates B: I'm feeling frustrated. I wish I could do things on my own.\nClassmates A: I understand how you feel. It can be tough when you feel like you're dependent on others.\nClassmates B: Yeah, exactly. I don't want to be a burden on anyone.\nClassmates A: You're not a burden, don't worry. And I'm always here to help you out.\nClassmates B: I appreciate that, but I don't want to always rely on others. I want to be more independent.\nClassmates A: I get it. Maybe there are some small things you can do on your own to start feeling more independent?\nClassmates B: Like what?\nClassmates A: Well, maybe you can start by making a list of things you'd like to do on your own and we can work on achieving those goals together.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B enjoy playing music together, as they have a friendly and supportive relationship.\n2. Classmates A and B find it awesome to pursue their passions after a conversation about following dreams.\n3. Classmates A and B both enjoy reminiscing about childhood memories, including playing on swings and making music with friends.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That's a good idea. I'll start with making that list. Thanks for being so supportive.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains information about the relationship and past interactions of Classmates A and B, indicating that they have a friendly and supportive relationship and share common interests such as music and pursuing passions. However, this information lacks direct relevance to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on Classmate B's desire to become more independent and the emotional struggle associated with it. The MEMORY doesn't give specific contextual cues or provide insight into how their past interactions may influence or relate to Classmate B's current frustration and desire for independence. Although the MEMORY is somewhat well-structured in describing their general relationship, it doesn't offer helpful information relevant to generating a supportive and contextually appropriate response specifically for Classmate B's current emotional state and concerns."
