    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Teacher, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn.\nTeacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation?\nStudent: It's a love-hate relationship. I enjoy the flavor, but sometimes it's too much to handle.\nTeacher: That's understandable. Did you know that some people build up a tolerance to spicy foods over time?\nStudent: Really? Maybe I should try to build up my tolerance then.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The teacher's support and emphasis on safety led the student to appreciate their relationship and apologize for the incident. The teacher and student now share a positive and understanding bond.\n2. The teacher's advice on safety prompted the student to open up about feeling stressed, possibly contributing to the outburst. Excited about retiring, the student is already planning fun activities to spend time with their grandkids.\n3. Understanding the student's needs, the teacher now encourages retirement plans, stressing the importance of family during that time.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided seems unrelated to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY focuses on a teacher-student relationship involving discussions about safety, stress, and retirement, which do not connect with the current dialogue about spicy food and building tolerance to it. The sentences in MEMORY do not offer any relevant information about the interaction between the teacher and student in the given dialogue context. As such, they do not aid in generating a proper next response. Additionally, the MEMORY sentences are not structured in a way that suggests development relevant to the context, making it difficult for the language model to extract useful information."
