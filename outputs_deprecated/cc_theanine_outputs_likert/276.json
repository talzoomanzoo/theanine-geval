Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel really fulfilled as a leader and guide. Helping others gives me a sense of purpose.\nCo-workers B: I can see that. You always seem to know just what to do to make people feel better.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I've had a lot of practice over the years. It's just something that comes naturally to me.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A had an argument with the director about the play they are putting on, which made them hesitant to bring up the problem with their supervisor for fear of being seen as a tattletale. This experience contrasts with a positive encounter with a commander who helped them feel safe.\n\n2. Co-worker A wants to ensure the best production for the audience and hopes to find a compromise with the director. Meanwhile, Co-worker B values finding fulfillment in work, pursuing hobbies, making a difference in the world, and building relationships with others.\n\n3. Co-worker A wants to ensure the best production for the audience and hopes to find a compromise with the director. Additionally, they believe that making money can lead to fulfillment and provide the freedom to pursue hobbies and interests, showing a strong interest in opportunities to earn money.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Co-workers B",
    "raw_prediction": "That's a great quality to have. It's wonderful to see how you positively impact those around you.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as Co-worker A's dedication to their work and their desire to ensure the best production, which aligns with their sense of fulfillment discussed in the context. Additionally, MEMORY mentions Co-worker B's values, like finding fulfillment in work and relationships, which connects to Co-worker A's feeling of purpose through helping others. However, the details about the argument with the director and the encounter with a commander do not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT or contribute to generating a proper next response. While some sentences are naturally phrased and helpful, others are not as well connected or relevant, leading to a moderate score."
