    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, how's it going?\nNeighbors B: Not bad, thanks. How about you?\nNeighbors A: Oh, I'm doing alright. I was just thinking about the old days when I had my rock band.\nNeighbors B: Really? You had a band?\nNeighbors A: Yeah, we were called \"The Neighbors A Band.\" We used to play live shows around the city.\nNeighbors B: That's awesome! What kind of music did you guys play?\nNeighbors A: We played rock music, mostly covers but we also wrote some of our own songs.\nNeighbors B: Have you ever thought about starting the band again?\nNeighbors A: Not really, it was just a fun hobby back then. Plus, I don't think I have the same energy as I did when I was younger.\nNeighbors B: That's understandable. Do you still play any instruments?\nNeighbors A: I have a guitar but I haven't played it in a while. Maybe I should start practicing again.\nNeighbors B: Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. Maybe you could even teach me a thing or two.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Neighbor A offered to provide the name of their chiropractor to Neighbor B if they decide to go, which led to a discussion about playing together with toys and ended with Neighbor A appreciating the support and friendship of Neighbor B.\n- Neighbor A has been dealing with back pain for a few months but sought help from a chiropractor, avoiding surgery. Neighbor A looks forward to playing with Neighbor B again when feeling better, and Neighbor B is familiar with Neighbor A's dog and looking forward to playing with it again. The interaction also ended with Neighbor A appreciating the support and friendship of Neighbor B.\n- Neighbor A offered to provide the name of their chiropractor to Neighbor B if they decide to go, leading to a discussion about playing together with toys and ended with Neighbor A appreciating the support and friendship of Neighbor B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Neighbors A",
    "raw_prediction": "That could be fun! I'll have to dust off my guitar and start strumming again.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does not effectively support the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context revolves around Neighbor A reminiscing about their past experiences in a rock band and discussing potentially playing the guitar again, along with Neighbor B's interest in learning. Meanwhile, the MEMORY includes conversations about Neighbor A's chiropractic visits and back pain, discussing playing with toys, and ending with Neighbor A appreciating the friendship of Neighbor B. While both the CONTEXT and MEMORY involve Neighbor B's friendship and support, the MEMORY lacks direct references to past musical endeavors or future musical plans, thus offering limited helpfulness for generating an appropriate next response related to the past band activities or playing the guitar. Therefore, it doesn't adequately reflect the discussed progress or relevant interactions in the current context."
