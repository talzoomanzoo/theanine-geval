Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I just visited this amazing new city. The architecture was stunning, the streets were so clean, and the people were very friendly.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like you had a great time! Which city did you visit?\nNeighbors A: It was Chicago. I had never been before, but it exceeded all my expectations.\nNeighbors B: I bet it was a nice change of scenery from our neighborhood.\nNeighbors A: Definitely. But you know, it's interesting how much our neighborhood has grown on me over the years. I remember when I first moved here, I was so unsure about it.\nNeighbors B: Yeah, I remember. But you stayed because you wanted to be here.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A has been living in the same place for a long time and enjoys the neighborhood and people there. This has made them feel comfortable and safe, and they have made good friends, including Neighbors B, whom they value and consider like family. This has led Neighbors A to be excited to explore the neighborhood and make new friends.\n\nNeighbor B has moved around a lot over the years but is considering settling down in the current neighborhood. This change in lifestyle has made Neighbors A enjoy living in the neighborhood, feeling comfortable and safe, and has made good friends, including Neighbors B. They both find comfort in living in the same place. Neighbors A found a park and a coffee shop nearby that they want to visit.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Neighbors A",
    "raw_prediction": "That's true. And now, I can't imagine living anywhere else.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some relevant context to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, particularly in highlighting Neighbor A's long-standing affection for the neighborhood, which correlates with their mention of how the neighborhood has grown on them. There's also an implication of their friendship with Neighbor B, who has also moved around a lot but is now contemplating settling down, which ties into the conversation. However, the MEMORY contains some repetitive information, such as Neighbors A enjoying living in the neighborhood and feeling comfortable. This information, while consistent, does not significantly advance the dialogue context. Moreover, details like the mention of a park and coffee shop aren't directly relevant to the conversation and add some noise. The MEMORY would be more helpful if it provided additional insights into the specific dynamics or shared experiences between the neighbors that could enrich the dialogue development."
