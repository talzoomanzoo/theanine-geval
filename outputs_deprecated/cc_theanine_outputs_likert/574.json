    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination.\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off.\nNeighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks?\nNeighbors A: I have, but then I get sidetracked with something else.\nNeighbors B: Maybe you need a change of scenery. Have you tried studying or working in a different location?\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, I'll try working at the library instead of at home.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A values their friendship with Neighbor B, describing them as a great neighbor, which causes Neighbor A to consider using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder.\nNeighbor A helped Neighbor B build a new house with amazing features, and in reaction, Neighbor B reminds Neighbor A of their potential to do good things, referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them. This makes Neighbor A want to believe that plants need sunlight, water, and love to thrive.\nNeighbor A enjoys building houses and finishing them quickly, which causes Neighbor B to be grateful for the help and quick completion of the new home, resulting in Neighbor B receiving a new house built by Neighbor A and being grateful for the extra space.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Good idea! A change of scenery can really help with focus. Hopefully, the library environment will help you tackle that project before the deadline.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some information about Neighbor A and Neighbor B's past interactions, such as helping build a house and the appreciation shown for quick completion. However, the connection between this information and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is minimal. The MEMORY talks about building houses and gratitude, which doesn't provide much relevance to the issue at hand in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is Neighbor A struggling with focus and procrastination. Although the MEMORY includes a reminder by Neighbor B of Neighbor A's potential, it doesn't directly relate to the current dialogue about finding ways to improve productivity. Additionally, some parts of the MEMORY, such as beliefs about plants needing sunlight, water, and love, seem disconnected and do not contribute to the dialogue contextâ€™s topic of procrastination and productivity. Therefore, the MEMORY is only slightly helpful in generating a proper next response in context."
