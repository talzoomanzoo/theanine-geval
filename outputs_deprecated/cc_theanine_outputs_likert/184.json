    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, have you checked out my new blog? It's all about promoting under-the-radar artists.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B both value trying new things and taking risks for personal development. Classmates B supports Classmates A's perspective on living authentically and free from others' opinions, as Classmate A values independence and focuses on their own happiness. This has led Classmates A to pursue their passions and enjoy life.\n\n2. Classmates A and B, who are in the same class, have discussed study tips in the past. Classmates B gave advice to Classmates A that paid off, leading to a beneficial outcome for Classmate A.\n\n3. Classmates B encouraged Classmates A to step out of their comfort zone and try new things for personal growth. Both speakers highlight the importance of focusing on personal happiness and not being swayed by external judgments.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, I saw it! Your blog is awesome, and I love how you're supporting emerging artists. Keep up the great work!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY does provide some helpful information that can be used to generate a next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The first and third sentences describe values and behaviors shared between Classmates A and B, such as trying new things, taking risks, and focusing on personal happiness. These elements can be related to Classmate A's new blog about promoting under-the-radar artists, as this activity might be an example of stepping out of their comfort zone and pursuing their interests independently. \n\nFurthermore, Classmate B's support and encouragement, as highlighted in the first and third sentences, might be relevant if the dialogue continues with a discussion on the process or motivations behind creating the blog. \n\nHowever, the second sentence about discussing study tips seems less connected to the current dialogue context and does not provide useful contextual cues related to the blog or theme of promoting artists. \n\nOverall, while there is relevant information connecting Classmate A's values and actions to the dialogue context, MEMORY lacks a clear and natural connection across all sentences to consistently support the next response about the blog. Hence, MEMORY is rated as moderately helpful at a score of 3."
