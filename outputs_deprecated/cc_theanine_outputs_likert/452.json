    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something.\nClassmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\nClassmates A: Well, it’s been on my mind for a while now and I couldn’t shake it off. I just can't stop thinking about you.\nClassmates B: Oh, really?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B are working on a group project together, as they are students in the same class. This shared project leads to Classmates A discovering a secret that Classmates B has been keeping. Reflecting on this, Classmate A recalls a moment where they admired Classmate B's courage and strength in sharing the secret, showcasing their supportive and compassionate nature.\n\n2. Classmates B assures Classmates A of their commitment to the group project, which prompts Classmate A to appreciate and value Classmates B's support and advice. This interaction reveals that Classmate A tends to overthink things and struggles with self-criticism, especially when it comes to feeling satisfied with their work.\n\n3. Initially, Classmates A had doubts about trusting Classmates B due to rumors about their reliability. However, as they work together in the same class, Classmate A eventually discovers a secret that Classmate B has been keeping. This discovery leads Classmate A to recall a moment where they admired Classmate B's courage and supportive nature in sharing the secret, strengthening their bond.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Classmates A",
    "raw_prediction": "I've noticed how supportive you've been throughout our project, and I truly appreciate it.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant contextual information that enhances understanding of Classmates A and B's relationship and interactions. The MEMORY effectively highlights the development of trust and appreciation between the two classmates through their shared experiences. For instance, Classmates A's journey from having doubts due to rumors to admiring Classmates B's courage helps inform why Classmate A might be thinking deeply and personally about Classmate B in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY also touches upon Classmates A's tendency to overthink, which might relate to the urgency and personal nature of the dialogue. However, the MEMORY could be more concise or more directly linked to the immediate conversation, hence the score of 4 instead of a 5."
