Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, how's it going?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor B's interest in chiropractic care, after hearing about Neighbor A's positive experience, has led to Neighbor A looking forward to playing with Neighbor B again once feeling better. Neighbor A also appreciates the support and friendship of Neighbor B. Additionally, Neighbor A's enjoyment of the different culture and exploration of the city is a result of having moved to London in the past and learning how to manage stress.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information that can be helpful for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It mentions Neighbor B's interest in chiropractic care after learning about Neighbor A's positive experience, which shows a connection between the two. Additionally, it highlights Neighbor A's appreciation for their friendship and support, indicating a positive rapport between them, which can be useful for the continuation of the conversation. However, the reference to Neighbor A's enjoyment of exploring a new culture and moving to London doesn't directly relate to the current greeting context, and might not be immediately relevant for replying to a simple \"how's it going?\". Despite this, the MEMORY is phrased in a way that still provides a general idea of their past interactions and relationship, which can guide the model's response generation."
