Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel so grateful to have a boss who is always so supportive of me.\nCo-workers B: That's amazing to hear. Having a supportive boss can make all the difference in how you feel about your job.\n\nMEMORY:\n- [Co-worker A and Co-worker B met on a movie set and are now good friends.] - (SameTopic) - [Co-worker A felt remorse for what they did and appreciated Co-worker B's understanding.] - (React) - [Co-worker A is grateful for life experiences and is open to new possibilities in the future.] \n- [Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B feel that their collaboration brought out the best in each other during the shoot.] - (React) - [Co-worker A felt remorse for what they did and appreciated Co-worker B's understanding.] - (React) - [Co-worker A is grateful for life experiences and is open to new possibilities in the future.] \n- [Both Co-worker A and Co-worker B feel that their collaboration brought out the best in each other during the shoot.] - [Co-worker B expressed disapproval of Co-worker A's actions and suggested talking to the director to address the stressful situation.] - (React) - [Co-worker B encourages Co-worker A to try relaxation techniques or find a hobby to de-stress and overcome fears.] - (Causes) - [Co-worker A has grown as a person and as an artist, learning about empathy and compassion.]\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, it really does. I feel like I can grow and take on new challenges knowing that my boss is behind me.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided contains several sentences that touch on past interactions, but they lack clear connection or development relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While certain elements, like Co-worker B's support for Co-worker A, are mentioned, the information included is often repetitive or unrelated to the specific context of having a supportive boss. Sentences that do relate to collaboration and understanding between the co-workers could be helpful, but they are poorly connected to the current dialogue, reducing their effectiveness in generating a coherent response. The MEMORY lacks naturally structured context and essential cues to confidently guide the language model in generating the next response."
