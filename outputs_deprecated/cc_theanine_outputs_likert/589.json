    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Wife, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: I'm feeling stuck with my writing. I've been searching everywhere for new ideas, but nothing seems to work.\nWife: Have you tried brainstorming with me? Sometimes bouncing ideas off of someone else can help.\nHusband: I have, but I don't want to bother you too much with my writing stuff.\nWife: Nonsense! You can always come to me with anything. Plus, I enjoy helping you with your creative process. Have you also tried revisiting some of the writing prompts we did in our creative writing class?\nHusband: I have, but I feel like I'm just repeating the same stories over and over again.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The wife is knowledgeable about movies and is willing to share her passion with the husband. The husband acknowledges that it may be difficult for the wife but wants to be honest about his feelings for Sarah. Despite this, the husband says he hasn't thought about Sarah much. The wife remembers the husband being nervous before the presentation.\n\n2. The wife is knowledgeable about movies and is willing to share her passion with the husband. Both the husband and wife express a desire for happiness and understanding in the situation. As a result, the wife suggests that the husband should try using more modern language to be better understood, since he talks differently than most people by using words like \"thou\" and \"thee.\"\n\n3. The husband fell asleep during the wife's movie, showing a lack of interest or attention. This leads the wife to compare the situation to when the husband fell asleep during a movie she recommended, indicating past issues in their relationship. Additionally, the husband felt like he was being judged and humiliated during the presentation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Maybe it's time to explore a new genre or writing style. Sometimes a fresh approach can spark new ideas and break that cycle.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some general information about the husband and wife's past interactions, such as the wife's knowledge about movies, the husband's feelings about Sarah, and incidents related to the husband's lack of interest in watching movies. However, these details do not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where the primary issue is the husband's struggle with writing and looking for new ideas. Additionally, the connections made between the sentences in the MEMORY do not offer much substantial context or development of past interactions specifically related to the current dialogue topic. As such, the MEMORY does not provide sufficiently helpful information to assist in generating the next response in the conversation about the husband's writing difficulties."
