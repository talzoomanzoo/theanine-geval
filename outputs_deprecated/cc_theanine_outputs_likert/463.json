Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something.\nClassmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\nClassmates A: Well, it’s been on my mind for a while now and I couldn’t shake it off. I just can't stop thinking about you.\nClassmates B: Oh, really?\nClassmates A: Yes, really. I know we've been friends for a while now, but I feel like there may be something more between us.\nClassmates B: Hmm, I never thought about it that way. But I can’t deny that we have a great connection.\nClassmates A: Exactly! I just feel like we could be more than just friends. If it's something you're open to, of course.\nClassmates B: I get what you’re saying,. And to be honest, I’ve had similar thoughts lately. I’m definitely open to exploring this.\nClassmates A: I’m so relieved to hear that. I was worried that I might be crossing a line by expressing my feelings.\nClassmates B: No, not at all. I’m glad you did. It takes courage to express your true feelings. \nClassmates A: Yeah, I guess it does. It’s just that I’ve been hurt before, and I don’t want to lose you as a friend too.\nClassmates B: I understand your concerns,. but I think we can make this work. We've already built a strong foundation of friendship, which is important for any relationship.\nClassmates A: That’s true. I feel like we can take this in any direction that we want.\nClassmates B: Definitely. We can take our time, explore our feelings, and see where it all leads.\nClassmates A: Agreed. I'm excited to see where this journey takes us.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A had doubts about trusting Classmates B due to rumors about their reliability, but they are supportive friends who look out for each other during stressful times. Classmates A offered help and support to Classmates B, recalling a moment where they admired Classmate B's courage and strength in sharing a secret, showing their supportive and compassionate nature.\n\n2. Classmates A and B are working on a group project together, and they are supportive friends who look out for each other during stressful times. They have a close relationship and a level of trust between them. Classmate A values setting high standards and is hesitant to lower them.\n\n3. Classmates A and B are working on a group project together. Classmates A tends to overthink things and appreciated Classmates B's support and advice, as Classmate A is very self-critical and struggles with feeling satisfied with their work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Me too. It's a new chapter for us, and I think it'll be an exciting journey to navigate together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information that relates to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but does not do so comprehensively. In the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, Classmates A and B are discussing their feelings for each other and their potential transition from friends to something more. MEMORY 1 talks about Classmates B's courage and strength, which aligns with Classmates B's willingness to explore a deeper relationship in the dialogue. However, the mention of rumors about reliability could potentially contradict or impact the development, but it's not entirely clear without further context. MEMORY 2 and MEMORY 3 emphasize their support for each other during stressful times and that they work well together, which support the foundation of their strong friendship mentioned in the dialogue. However, none of the MEMORY entries directly address the romantic feelings or emotional complexity Classmates A articulates about their past hurt or fear of losing the friendship, which would be central to generating a suitable next response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The sentences provide some connection and context but are not optimally structured to fully relate to the development of events in the context."
