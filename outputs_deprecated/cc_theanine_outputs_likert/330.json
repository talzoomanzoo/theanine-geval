Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey neighbor, how's it going?\nNeighbors B: Not bad, thanks. How about you?\nNeighbors A: Oh, I'm doing alright. I was just thinking about the old days when I had my rock band.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A has been dealing with back pain for a few months but sought help from a chiropractor, avoiding surgery. Neighbors A looks forward to playing with Neighbors B again when feeling better. Neighbors A recently moved to London from their current location. Neighbors A moved to London in the past and had to learn how to manage stress. \nNeighbor A offered to provide the name of their chiropractor to Neighbor B if they decide to go. Neighbors A and Neighbors B enjoy playing together with toys. Neighbors A appreciated the support and friendship of Neighbors B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I remember those days! Your rock band was awesome.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains several pieces of information about Neighbors A that could be somewhat relevant or helpful for generating a continuation of the conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. For example, the mention of Neighbor A's back pain and chiropractor visits might tie into discussing their ability to play in a rock band. Additionally, Neighbors A's looking forward to playing with Neighbors B when feeling better could suggest they have a shared interest or band experience, relating to the \"rock band\" mentioned in the dialogue.\n\nHowever, some details, such as Neighbors A's move to London and stress management, are not directly relevant to the current conversation. Despite being well-structured and connected, they do not strongly contribute to the conversation about the rock band or immediate context. Overall, the MEMORY contains relevant parts but also several pieces that may not significantly aid the language model in generating a highly relevant response, warranting a middle-range score."
