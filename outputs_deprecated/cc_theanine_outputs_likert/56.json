Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, how's your workload today?\nCo-workers B: It's pretty heavy, but I'm managing.\nCo-workers A: Do you need any help? I don't want you to get overwhelmed.\nCo-workers B: That's really nice of you, but I don't want to burden you with my work.\nCo-workers A: It's not a burden if it's something I can do to support you. Plus, helping you out makes me feel good too.\nCo-workers B: You're right, thank you. You always go above and beyond to help me out.\nCo-workers A: That's what co-workers are for. We're a team and we need to support each other.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of teamwork, remember when you showed me your plans for the future a few months ago? I'm still excited about the idea of working on a project together.\nCo-workers A: Me too! I think we would make a great business partnership.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A has been feeling off lately, but after borrowing the horse from Co-worker B, they are grateful and enjoying the ride. This gesture from Co-worker B has made both of them happy. Co-worker B is also impressed by Co-worker A's detailed plans for their future partnership. \n\nCo-worker B offering help and support to Co-worker A led to a positive response from Co-worker A, who now feels motivated and excited about working together. This supportive dynamic between them has strengthened their bond and mutual admiration for each other's efforts.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY reflects a supportive dynamic between Co-worker A and B, which aligns with the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where they discuss helping each other and considering a future partnership. However, it introduces an unrelated element about borrowing a horse, which is unnecessary and distracts from the main conversation theme. The MEMORY does capture mutual admiration and a developing bond, which can potentially aid in generating a relevant response as it supports the idea of teamwork and collaboration mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Therefore, the MEMORY provides moderate support for generating the next response based on its helpful elements but is partly diminished by unrelated content."
