Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I feel really fulfilled as a leader and guide. Helping others gives me a sense of purpose.\nCo-workers B: I can see that. You always seem to know just what to do to make people feel better.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I've had a lot of practice over the years. It's just something that comes naturally to me.\nCo-workers B: Do you remember that time when you were led to a safe place by the commander? You must have felt pretty grateful for his guidance then.\nCo-workers A: Absolutely. It was a really tough time and I was so relieved to have someone show me the way. I try to pay it forward by being that kind of leader for others.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. [Co-worker A had a positive experience with a commander who helped them feel safe.] - (React) - [Co-worker A is hesitant to bring up the problem with their supervisor for fear of being seen as a tattletale.]\n2. [Co-worker B emphasizes the importance of acknowledging privileges and using them to make the world a better place.] - (Want) - [Co-worker B suggests talking to the supervisor if Mary's behavior affects work.] - (Causes) - [Co-worker A asked Mary about her mean behavior, and Mary mentioned personal issues were the cause.]\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That kind of support and guidance can make a huge difference in someone's life. It's great that you're able to pass that on to others in need.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT but lacks a clear and structured connection between the past interactions that would aid in generating a response. The first memory snippet about Co-worker A’s positive experience with a commander is relevant as it directly connects to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Co-worker A discusses feeling grateful for guidance. However, the mention of hesitation to bring up a problem with a supervisor doesn't contribute to the current dialogue. The second memory snippet highlights Co-worker B’s views on privileges, which are not directly connected to the context of leadership and guidance discussed in the dialogue. These snippets do not naturally demonstrate development or connection relevant to the core theme of the dialogue, making it less helpful."
