Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm sorry you had to hear me swear like that. I shouldn't have lost my temper like that.\nNeighbors B: It's okay, I understand how frustrating things can be sometimes. What got you so upset?\nNeighbors A: It was just something that happened at work. My boss was being unreasonable and I couldn't take it anymore.\nNeighbors B: That's understandable. Have you tried talking to your boss about it?\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I have, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I just feel like I'm stuck in a dead-end job.\nNeighbors B: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you considered looking for a new job?\nNeighbors A: I have, but with the current job market, it's really tough. Plus, I don't have a lot of experience in other fields.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A highlighted the importance of taking care of belongings, whether inside or outside, for cost-effectiveness, which resonated with Neighbors B who mentioned the sense of community built through helping each other. This led to both Neighbors A and B being helpful towards each other, with Neighbors B showing support and understanding of Neighbor A's mistake.\n\nNeighbor A emphasized the significance of maintaining clean outside spaces for the future, sparking a conversation about how Neighbors A and B help each other with tasks in the same neighborhood. This made Neighbor A express a desire to rearrange their living room, knowing that Neighbors B has experience with furniture rearrangement.\n\nNeighbor A brought up cleaning a tree house to prevent insects and spiders, leading to Neighbors A and B recalling instances of mutual support like when Neighbor A helped with Neighbors B's lawn. This further highlighted the supportive and understanding dynamic between Neighbors A and B.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I understand, job hunting can be challenging. Maybe you could explore opportunities where your current skills can be transferred to a different field.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe MEMORY provides some background context about the relationship and interactions between Neighbors A and B, mainly focusing on their mutual support and shared activities like cleaning and rearranging spaces. However, this information is not directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is centered around Neighbor A's work frustrations and job concerns. The MEMORY lacks specific references or cues that would supply Neighbor B with helpful information to continue the conversation about work issues or explore potential solutions. While it does highlight the supportive nature of their relationship, it doesn't significantly aid in generating a response related to the specific situation in the dialogue context, therefore receiving a low score on the helpfulness criterion."
