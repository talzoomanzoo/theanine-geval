Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I marked the boundary line with a pen on the wall so that we can both be clear about where my property ends and your property begins.\nNeighbors B: Oh, okay. I didn't realize there was any confusion about that.\nNeighbors A: Well, I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page. I don't want any misunderstandings in the future.\nNeighbors B: I understand. Is there anything else we should do to make sure we're clear about this?\nNeighbors A: I don't think so, but if you have any other suggestions, I'm open to hearing them.\nNeighbors B: No, I think the line is a good idea. It's clear and simple.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor B admires Neighbor A's career advancement, expresses interest in borrowing the personal development book, and offers to be more supportive by checking in on Neighbor A more often. \nNeighbor A enjoys reading and sharing books with Neighbor B, and they both emphasize the importance of taking care of each other as neighbors. \nNeighbor A and Neighbor B went to a concert together in the past and had a great time, but recently, Neighbor A was promoted to manager and is struggling to adjust to the new responsibilities.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information about Neighbor A and Neighbor B's past interactions and their relationship, which may help convey the tone of their conversations as friendly and supportive. However, the specific details provided in the MEMORY (such as borrowing a personal development book, attending a concert, and adjusting to a managerial role) are not directly relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which focuses on clarifying property lines. While MEMORY shows some connection and development of their past interactions, it does not significantly aid in generating a proper next response for the specific conversation at hand. The MEMORIES are also not naturally connected to the present DIALOGUE CONTEXT, somewhat limiting their helpfulness."
