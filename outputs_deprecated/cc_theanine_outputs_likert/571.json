    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus.\nNeighbors B: Sounds like a case of procrastination.\nNeighbors A: Yeah, I always find a way to put things off.\nNeighbors B: Have you tried setting specific goals or breaking down the project into smaller tasks?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A values their friendship with Neighbor B, describing them as a great neighbor, which causes Neighbor A to consider using their skills for good instead of evil after Neighbor B's reminder.\nNeighbor A helped Neighbor B build a new house with amazing features, which reminds Neighbor A of their potential to do good things, referencing a house that Neighbor A built for them. As a result, Neighbor A wants to believe that plants need sunlight, water, and love to thrive.\nNeighbor B is grateful for the help and quick completion of the new home built by Neighbor A, which causes Neighbor B to receive a new house and be grateful for the extra space.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've tried that approach before, but maybe I need to give it another shot. Thanks for the reminder, I'll try breaking it down into smaller tasks this time.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY contains some relevant information regarding the relationship and dynamics between Neighbor A and Neighbor B, such as Neighbor A valuing their friendship and Neighbor B expressing gratitude for assistance. However, the memory largely focuses on the past event of building a house and doesn't offer much support for generating a response directly related to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is about procrastination and setting goals. Furthermore, the sentences in MEMORY lack clear development or causality that ties them neatly into the present conversation context. As a result, while there is a hint of past interaction that might help recognize the friendship dynamic, there is not enough clear, structured information that directly aids in generating a response pertinent to Neighbor Aâ€™s current problem."
