Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I marked the boundary line with a pen on the wall so that we can both be clear about where my property ends and your property begins.\nNeighbors B: Oh, okay. I didn't realize there was any confusion about that.\nNeighbors A: Well, I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page. I don't want any misunderstandings in the future.\nNeighbors B: I understand. Is there anything else we should do to make sure we're clear about this?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor B enjoys listening to Neighbor A read and is interested in reading more. Neighbor A enjoys reading and sharing books with Neighbor B, causing Neighbors A to believe in setting goals, developing a positive attitude, and taking action for personal development and career advancement. This leads to Neighbors A offering to help Neighbors B with getting into a workout routine. In reaction, Neighbors B offers to be more supportive and check in on Neighbors A more often.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about the relationship between Neighbors A and B, specifically that they have a positive relationship involving shared interests like reading, personal development, and mutual support. However, the MEMORY does not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is about clarifying property boundaries. The information about their past interactions, such as sharing books and offering help with workouts, does not directly contribute to generating a response about property boundaries. Additionally, the MEMORY is not structured in a way that shows clear development or causality related to the current dialogue scenario. Therefore, while the MEMORY reflects a positive relationship, it is not highly helpful for generating a response relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
