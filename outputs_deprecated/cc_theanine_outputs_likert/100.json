Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I have some exciting plans for the future that I wanted to share with you.\nClassmates B: Oh really? What are they?\nClassmates A: Well, I was thinking that we could work on a project together and maybe even become business partners.\nClassmates B: Wow, that sounds amazing! What kind of project are you thinking about?\nClassmates A: I was thinking about starting a marketing agency specialized in social media.\nClassmates B: That's a great idea! I'd love to work with you on that. We could really make a difference in the industry.\nClassmates A: Yes, exactly! And I think our skills complement each other's so well.\nClassmates B: I totally agree. You're so creative and outgoing, while I'm more analytical and detail-oriented.\nClassmates A: It's like we were meant to work together, right?\nClassmates B: Absolutely! I can't wait to see what the future holds for us.\nClassmates A: Me too. And honestly, it's a bit of a relief to finally have a solid plan for the future.\nClassmates B: Yeah, I get that. Speaking of the future, how have you been doing with your sleeping problems?\nClassmates A: It's been a slow process, but I've been making progress with it. I started doing yoga and meditation before bed, and that's been helping a lot.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate A encourages Classmate B to initiate conversations and be friendly to make new friends, which causes Classmates B to appreciate Classmates A's gesture of buying coffee. This leads to Classmates A agreeing to try the suggestion and thanking Classmates B for it, showing that Classmates B wants Classmates A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future.\n\n2. Classmates A and B both enjoy socializing and going out to parties together, and they are open to meeting for coffee again in the future. This mutual interest in socializing also extends to both planning to relax at home later in the day. Additionally, Classmates B suggests meditation or breathing exercises to help Classmates A relax before bed, which causes Classmates A to consider talking to a therapist or counselor to address past issues.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Classmates B",
    "raw_prediction": "That's great to hear! It's amazing how simple practices like yoga and meditation can make a big difference in our daily lives.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful contextual information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It shows a history of mutual support and friendship between Classmates A and B, as well as Classmate B already suggesting relaxation methods to help with Classmate A's sleeping problems, which ties in directly to the current conversation about sleep and yoga. The first memory highlights Classmate A's encouragement and appreciation toward Classmate B's advice, which aligns with the ongoing dialogue theme of partnership and mutual support. The second memory is relevant because it includes the suggestion of meditation, aligning with Classmate A's current approach to addressing sleep problems, showing interconnected past interactions that are beneficial for a language model to process. However, the introduction of extraneous information, such as coffee-buying and socializing details, makes the memory less directly relevant at points, so a score of 4 is appropriate rather than a perfect 5."
