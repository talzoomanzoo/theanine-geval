Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Hey, can you keep a secret?\nNeighbors B: Of course, what's up?\nNeighbors A: I can't be seen because I am hiding from my mom behind the door.\nNeighbors B: Oh, why are you hiding from her?\nNeighbors A: She wants me to go to a family dinner tonight, but I'm too tired and just want to relax at home.\nNeighbors B: Maybe you should talk to her about it and let her know how you feel.\nNeighbors A: I know, but I don't want to disappoint her.\nNeighbors B: It's important to take care of your own needs and speak up for yourself. Plus, maybe you can compromise and go to the dinner for a little while and then come back home to relax.\nNeighbors A: That's a good idea, thanks for the advice.\nNeighbors B: No problem. Speaking of compromise, remember that dinner we went to a few days ago?\nNeighbors A: Yes, it was so much fun!\nNeighbors B: I'm glad you enjoyed it. Maybe we can make it a regular thing and try out new restaurants together.\nNeighbors A: That sounds great! And it gives me something to look forward to after work.\nNeighbors B: Speaking of work, how are you feeling about your job lately?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A enjoys cooking and made roasted vegetables and quinoa for dinner. Neighbors A and B joke about the fun aspects of using telekinesis to surprise people. Neighbor B offers support and suggests planning a dinner to celebrate Neighbor A's new adventures in learning. \nNeighbors B is interested in Neighbors A's cooking and asks about the vegetables and quinoa preparation. Neighbors A and B are discussing the idea of having telekinetic abilities. Neighbor B suggests that new skills could lead to new opportunities in Neighbor A's current job or future career.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed with work lately, but I'm trying to stay positive. How about you, how's everything going on your end?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY does not provide much helpful information for generating the next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. While there is some mention of cooking and dinner planning, these do not directly relate to hiding from the mom or discussing family commitments. The MEMORY talks about telekinesis and cooking adventures, which are disconnected from the central topic. There is a lack of continuity and connection between the past interactions and the current conversation, making it less relevant. The sentences are naturally phrased but lack relevancy to the specific situation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Thus, it scores lower on helpfulness."
