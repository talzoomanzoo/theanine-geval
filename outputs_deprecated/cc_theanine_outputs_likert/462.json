    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something.\nClassmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\nClassmates A: Well, it’s been on my mind for a while now and I couldn’t shake it off. I just can't stop thinking about you.\nClassmates B: Oh, really?\nClassmates A: Yes, really. I know we've been friends for a while now, but I feel like there may be something more between us.\nClassmates B: Hmm, I never thought about it that way. But I can’t deny that we have a great connection.\nClassmates A: Exactly! I just feel like we could be more than just friends. If it's something you're open to, of course.\nClassmates B: I get what you’re saying,. And to be honest, I’ve had similar thoughts lately. I’m definitely open to exploring this.\nClassmates A: I’m so relieved to hear that. I was worried that I might be crossing a line by expressing my feelings.\nClassmates B: No, not at all. I’m glad you did. It takes courage to express your true feelings. \nClassmates A: Yeah, I guess it does. It’s just that I’ve been hurt before, and I don’t want to lose you as a friend too.\nClassmates B: I understand your concerns,. but I think we can make this work. We've already built a strong foundation of friendship, which is important for any relationship.\nClassmates A: That’s true. I feel like we can take this in any direction that we want.\nClassmates B: Definitely. We can take our time, explore our feelings, and see where it all leads.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B's assurance to Classmates A in the group project leads to Classmates A offering support and stress-relieving massages to Classmates B, who then wants help and support from Classmates A.\n2. Classmates A and B working on a group project together is related to them being students in the same class, and also reflects their close relationship with a level of trust between them.\n3. In the context of working on a group project together, Classmates A tends to overthink things and appreciates Classmates B's support and advice, with Classmate B encouraging self-compassion and finding a balance between excellence and kindness.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information regarding the relationship between Classmates A and B, which is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It illustrates the fact that they have a history of collaboration and mutual support through a group project, suggesting that they have a foundation of trust and care for each other. This supports and adds depth to Classmate A's desire to transition from friendship to a romantic relationship, as expressed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. However, the connection between the memory of the group project and the current dialogue context isn't directly emphasized or very strong; the MEMORY primarily focuses on a different domain (academic collaboration), which isn't directly linked to the romantic context. This disjointedness reduces the overall helpfulness. Moreover, the MEMORY describes past events separately without a clear direct connection to the current situation. Therefore, while MEMORY provides context that can support the dialogue, it could be more seamlessly integrated to strengthen its helpfulness in generating the next response."
