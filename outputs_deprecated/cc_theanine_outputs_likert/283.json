Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Student, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn.\nTeacher: Hot sauce can definitely make things spicy. Do you enjoy the sensation?\n\nMEMORY:\nThe teacher and student share a positive and understanding relationship, as the teacher expressed understanding and encouraged the student to seek help when needed. \nThe student felt stressed lately, which may have led to an outburst, despite being praised by the teacher for bravery and quick action in an emergency situation. The student admitted to not talking to anyone about their stress and trying to deal with it alone, feeling rewarded by the emergency experience.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nThe MEMORY provides some contextual information about the relationship between the teacher and student, indicating that they share a positive and understanding relationship. However, the MEMORY mainly focuses on the student's stress and a past emergency situation, which does not seem directly relevant to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT about hot sauce and its spicy sensation. The connection between the MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is weak, and the details in the MEMORY do not provide clear or helpful information for generating a response related to the current topic of spicy sensations or hot sauce. Thus, the MEMORY's relevance to the current dialogue is limited, resulting in a low helpfulness score."
