    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, have you checked out my new blog? It's all about promoting under-the-radar artists.\nClassmates B: I haven't had a chance to yet, but that sounds really cool! What inspired you to start it?\nClassmates A: Well, I've always had a passion for the arts, but I was too afraid to pursue it. I finally realized that it's what I really love, and I wanted to share that love with others.\nClassmates B: That's amazing. It takes a lot of courage to pursue your passions like that.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Classmates A values living life on their own terms and being content with their choices.\n- Classmate A values independence and focuses on their own happiness.\n- Classmates A has been pursuing their passions and enjoying life.\n- Classmates B supports Classmates A's perspective on living authentically and free from others' opinions.\n- Classmate B emphasizes the importance of considering how actions may affect others.\n- Classmates B encouraged Classmates A to step out of their comfort zone and try new things for personal growth.\n- Classmates B expresses a desire to see Classmates A happy and successful in life.\n- They reconnected on Facebook after many years.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains relevant information that helps in understanding the interaction between Classmates A and B in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY provides insights into Classmate A's values and motivations, such as living life on their own terms, valuing independence, and pursuing passions. These details are helpful to the language model as they directly relate to Classmate A's decision to start a blog about promoting under-the-radar artists, as expressed in the context. Additionally, Classmate B's supportive stance and encouragement resonate with the current dialogue, reinforcing their attitude towards Classmate A's endeavors. While not all MEMORY entries are directly applicable to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, they are structured in a way that helps the language model to infer the supportive and motivational relationship between the classmates. Overall, the MEMORY provides a clear background that enriches and supports the discourse in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
