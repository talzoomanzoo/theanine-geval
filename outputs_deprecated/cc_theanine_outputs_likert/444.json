    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: It's great to have friends who can help each other out, isn't it?\nNeighbors B: Absolutely. It's a two-way street, and it's important to be there for each other.\nNeighbors A: I remember when I helped you move last year, and then you watched my cat when I went on vacation.\n\nMEMORY:\n- Neighbors A was looking for a new necklace and stumbled upon Neighbors B's shop. Neighbors B offered to help Neighbors A with the apology process.\n- Neighbors A's rug keeps curling up at the corners. Both neighbors express the difficulty of not being able to adopt all the animals they see but appreciate those who do adopt and give them loving homes. Both neighbors agreed that apologizing takes strength, not weakness.\n- Neighbors B has a great selection of earrings and is willing to help find the perfect match for the dress.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yes, that was a big help. It's nice to know we can rely on each other when needed.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does contain some potentially helpful information regarding interactions between Neighbors A and B, such as Neighbors A stumbling upon Neighbors B's shop and discussing the apology process, and the selection of earrings at Neighbors B's shop. However, these elements do not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT involving helping each other, moving, or pet sitting. The memory should ideally include more relevant and connected information about past interactions that reflect the supportive relationship mentioned in the dialogue. The mention of a gratitude exchange (for moving or cat sitting) or any past instances of helping each other could improve the score. The relevance to the dialogue context is limited, and the development of events between the two neighbors is not clearly demonstrated in the MEMORY."
