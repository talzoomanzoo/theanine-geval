Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I have some exciting plans for the future that I wanted to share with you.\nClassmates B: Oh really? What are they?\nClassmates A: Well, I was thinking that we could work on a project together and maybe even become business partners.\nClassmates B: Wow, that sounds amazing! What kind of project are you thinking about?\nClassmates A: I was thinking about starting a marketing agency specialized in social media.\nClassmates B: That's a great idea! I'd love to work with you on that. We could really make a difference in the industry.\nClassmates A: Yes, exactly! And I think our skills complement each other's so well.\nClassmates B: I totally agree. You're so creative and outgoing, while I'm more analytical and detail-oriented.\nClassmates A: It's like we were meant to work together, right?\nClassmates B: Absolutely! I can't wait to see what the future holds for us.\nClassmates A: Me too. And honestly, it's a bit of a relief to finally have a solid plan for the future.\nClassmates B: Yeah, I get that. Speaking of the future, how have you been doing with your sleeping problems?\n\nMEMORY:\n- Classmates B admires Classmates A's outgoing nature and appreciates their gesture of buying coffee.\n- Classmates A agrees to try the suggestion and thanks Classmates B for it, encouraging them to work through their feelings for a better future.\n- Classmates A encourages Classmates B to initiate conversations and be friendly to make new friends, and they are open to meeting for coffee again in the future.\n- Classmates B suggests going back to school or taking courses to improve, and Classmates A is looking forward to meeting up with them again after getting better sleep.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some helpful information that can aid a language model in generating a proper next response. Specifically, it sheds light on the relationship dynamics between the two classmates, including Classmate B's admiration for Classmate A's outgoing nature, and their past interactions involving conversations about self-improvement and future plans. The MEMORY also touches upon the subject of meetings for coffee and mentions Classmate B's suggestion about education, which adds depth to their relationship and suggests a history of supportive exchanges.\n\nHowever, the relevance of MEMORY to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT is somewhat limited. While there is a reference to future plans and improvement in MEMORY, which could link to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT's mention of future business endeavors, the connection is not particularly strong or direct. The MEMORY does not provide much explicit development or causality that can directly influence the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT or aid in addressing the topic of sleeping problems mentioned by Classmate B at the end of the conversation. \n\nOverall, while MEMORY contains relevant relational information, it doesn't directly enhance the current context significantly, leading to a score in the mid-range."
