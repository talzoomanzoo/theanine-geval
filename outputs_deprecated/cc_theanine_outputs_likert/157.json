Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today.\nClassmates B:  That sounds great. What was the talk about?\nClassmates A: It was about the history of the pyramids in Egypt. I learned so much about their construction and the cultural significance they held.\nClassmates B: Wow, that does sound interesting. Did you take any notes?\nClassmates A: Yes, I took lots of notes. I'm excited to study this topic more on my own time.\nClassmates B: That's awesome. It's great to see your enthusiasm for learning.\nClassmates A: Thanks. I've always been passionate about learning new things. Remember when we talked about how determined I was to get into college?\nClassmates B: Yeah, I remember. You were always studying and taking extra classes.\nClassmates A: And now, after all that hard work, I am actually in college. It just goes to show that with dedication, you can achieve your goals.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates A's dedication to studying hard and taking extra classes to get into a good college led to their willingness to work hard to achieve their dreams, which is supported by Classmates B. \nClassmates A's struggle with motivation but finding a way to stay focused by thinking about the payoff of their hard work resulted in their willingness to work hard to achieve their dreams, supported by Classmates B. \nClassmates B noticed Classmates A's improvement and acknowledged their hard work, showing support for Classmates A's new relationship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some relevant information about the conversation between Classmates A and B in terms of Classmates A's dedication and hard work, which is a theme touched upon in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Specifically, the MEMORY reflects Classmates A's determination to get into college and the support and recognition from Classmates B regarding that effort. However, there are aspects of the MEMORY that are either not directly relevant to the current dialogue or could benefit from clearer connections or phrasing. For instance, the mention of Classmates A's \"struggle with motivation\" and \"new relationship\" is not directly aligned with the dialogue context, and these points add unnecessary complexity. Overall, while the MEMORY includes pertinent aspects of Classmates A and B's past interactions, it lacks the clarity and focus that would make it highly helpful for generating the next response in this dialogue context."
