Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hey, I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I was promoted to product manager!\nCo-workers B: Really? Congrats! That's a big step up from your previous role.\nCo-workers A: Yeah, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. It's a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for the challenge.\nCo-workers B: I have no doubt that you'll do great. You've always been a strong leader and have a great eye for detail.\nCo-workers A: Thanks, that means a lot. I'm looking forward to working with the design team and coming up with some innovative new products.\nCo-workers B: Speaking of new products, remember when you used to fantasize about being a great leader?\nCo-workers A: Ha, yeah. That seems like ages ago.\nCo-workers B: Well, now you can finally take on that leadership role and make your dreams a reality.\nCo-workers A: That's true. It's amazing how life works out sometimes. But it hasn't always been smooth sailing. Remember when I was really stressed about you not liking me?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, I remember. But we worked through it, didn't we?\nCo-workers A: We definitely did. And it taught me to just take things one step at a time, like I am with this new role.\nCo-workers B: Exactly, and I'm sure you'll apply that same mentality to your training as well. I remember you were really dedicated to it a couple of years ago.\nCo-workers A: Oh yeah, I still try to keep up with it whenever I can. It's important to stay physically and mentally fit, especially with this new job.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A used to fantasize about being a great leader and being respected and admired. This aspiration has evolved over time, and now Co-worker A emphasizes the importance of communication as a key quality for leadership.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Co-workers B",
    "raw_prediction": "That dedication will serve you well in your new role. Just remember to take breaks and not burn yourself out.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful information that is relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, indicating Co-worker A's past aspirations of being a great leader, which ties into the current context of A's promotion to product manager. This helps establish a background on A's leadership goals and their evolution over time, which can inform Co-worker B's responses related to supporting A's new role. However, while this MEMORY contains relevant details, it is somewhat sparse and could benefit from additional specifics about past interactions or more fully developed insights connecting their shared experiences, such as the reference to communication as a leadership quality. This would further enable a conversation on how A's leadership style might influence their approach to the promotion, thus enhancing the helpfulness of generating coherent and contextually rich responses in future dialogue."
