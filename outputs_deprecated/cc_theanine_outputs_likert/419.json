Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm really excited about finding a buyer for my product. I think it has a lot of potential.\nNeighbors B: That's great to hear, what kind of product is it?\nNeighbors A: It's a new type of workout equipment that's designed to be more efficient than traditional equipment. I've been working on it for months now and I really think it's going to take off.\nNeighbors B: Wow, that sounds interesting. Have you started looking for potential buyers?\nNeighbors A: Yes, I've been reaching out to various gyms and fitness centers to see if they'd be interested in carrying the product. I've even gotten some positive feedback from a few places.\nNeighbors B: That's awesome! I'm sure with your determination, you'll find the perfect buyer soon.\nNeighbors A: Thanks, I really appreciate your support. It's been a long road, but I'm confident that all my hard work will pay off.\nNeighbors B: Speaking of hard work, have you made any progress at your current job? I remember you were having some trouble with your boss.\nNeighbors A: Yeah, unfortunately things didn't work out and I was let go. But I'm trying to look at it as an opportunity to focus on my own business ventures.\nNeighbors B: I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm glad you're pursuing your passion. And hey, at least you won't have to deal with that unpleasant boss anymore.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors B advised Neighbors A to change their behavior at work and be a responsible adult, which Neighbors A is trying to do to improve their behavior and be a better colleague.\nNeighbors B wants Neighbors A to succeed and emphasizes the importance of treating others with respect and putting in effort at work, while Neighbors A mentioned wishing they had followed the rules more, particularly at work.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Yeah, it's definitely a relief to leave that toxic environment behind. I'm looking forward to putting all my energy into my new business and making it a success.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides some context about the relationship between Neighbors A and B, showcasing a past discussion surrounding Neighbors A's behavior at work and Neighbors B's advice. However, it doesn't directly align with or contribute meaningful details to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is focused on Neighbors A's new product and a shift in career focus after losing their job. These past interactions are relevant in highlighting Neighbors B's supportive nature, yet they are not directly useful for generating a next response related to the current discussion about the product and entrepreneurial endeavor that Neighbors A is now pursuing. The MEMORY could be more helpful if it provided insights specifically connected to the current venture or more context on their relationship in the realm of entrepreneurship."
