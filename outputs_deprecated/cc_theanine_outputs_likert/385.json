Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Husband, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway?\nWife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go?\nHusband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city.\nWife: Oh, that sounds like a perfect idea! It will be nice to have some peace and quiet for a change.\n\nMEMORY:\nThe wife supports the husband's goals but wishes to be involved in them. Both the husband and wife are supportive of each other's dreams and aspirations.\nThe husband has long-awaited plans and is finally taking action on them. This causes the husband to apologize and promise to involve the wife in his plans in the future. He acknowledges his mistake, apologizes, and promises to make it up to his wife, emphasizing the importance of keeping promises and taking action.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "**Helpfulness Score: 4**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful context for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It gives insights into the relationship dynamics between the husband and wife, highlighting their mutual support for each other's goals and a recent instance where the husband apologized and promised to involve the wife in his plans. \n\nThis information is relevant as it aligns with the current conversation where the husband is proposing a plan to spend more time together, which indicates he's taking action on making up to his wife as per the MEMORY. \n\nThe structure of the MEMORY is sufficiently natural and clear, illustrating the development of their relationship and the husband's commitment to keeping promises. This helps the language model understand the underlying emotional tone and context, making it easier to generate an appropriate response.\n\nHowever, there is room for improvement in explicitly connecting the MEMORY to the proposed weekend getaway, which could make it even more relevant and supportive of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Hence, a score of 4 is given."
