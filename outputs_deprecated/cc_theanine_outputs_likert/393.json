    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Husband, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nHusband: Hey, Wife, I've been thinking that we should spend more time together. How about we go on a weekend getaway?\nWife: That sounds great, husband! Where do you want to go?\nHusband: Well, I was thinking of renting a cabin in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city.\nWife: Oh, that sounds like a perfect idea! It will be nice to have some peace and quiet for a change.\nHusband: Yes, and we could cook our meals together, go for a hike, and just relax. What do you think?\nWife: That sounds lovely, husband. I'm really looking forward to it.\nHusband: Great. I'll start looking for rental cabins right away. I know this may sound impulsive, but I'm really excited to make this happen.\nWife: Don't worry, husband, it's not impulsive. You always follow through with your plans, and I believe this will be a wonderful experience for both of us.\nHusband: Thank you, wife. And, I want to apologize for the time I left without waiting for you. I know I promised to wait, and I should have kept my word.\nWife: It's okay, husband. I understand that you were in a hurry, and it wasn't intentional. Besides, that was a long time ago, and we've moved past it.\nHusband: Thank you for being so understanding, wife. I just want to make sure I am not repeating the same mistake again.\nWife: I trust that you won't, husband. And hey, remember when I stopped a runaway carriage from causing harm to a group of people? That was quite the adrenaline rush!\n\nMEMORY:\nThe wife's support and encouragement motivate the husband to involve her in his future plans. The husband's long-awaited actions are influenced by his promise to include his wife in his plans. The husband's determination to achieve his dreams causes him to act impulsively, leaving without the wife, reminiscent of a past disappointment when he broke a promise to wait for her.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Husband",
    "raw_prediction": "Yes, that was quite the heroic moment, wife. You always manage to handle challenging situations with grace and courage.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains some relevant information regarding the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, such as the husband's impulsive nature and the past incident where he left without waiting for his wife. This aligns with the conversation where the husband apologizes for his past action. However, the MEMORY could be more detailed and specific in capturing more aspects of their interactions, like the wife's supportive nature and their collective excitement for planning a getaway. Additionally, some phrases like \"long-awaited actions\" are a bit vague and could be more specific to clarify their relevance to the current context. Overall, the MEMORY provides some helpful context but falls short of delivering comprehensive and seamlessly connected information relevant to the dialogue context."
