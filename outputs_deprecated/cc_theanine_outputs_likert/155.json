    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today.\nClassmates B:  That sounds great. What was the talk about?\nClassmates A: It was about the history of the pyramids in Egypt. I learned so much about their construction and the cultural significance they held.\nClassmates B: Wow, that does sound interesting. Did you take any notes?\nClassmates A: Yes, I took lots of notes. I'm excited to study this topic more on my own time.\nClassmates B: That's awesome. It's great to see your enthusiasm for learning.\nClassmates A: Thanks. I've always been passionate about learning new things. Remember when we talked about how determined I was to get into college?\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates A's dedication to studying hard and taking extra classes to get into a good college has motivated them to work on an essay about the Industrial Revolution. This hard work is also noticed by Classmates B, who acknowledges their improvement and supports their efforts. Additionally, despite a moment of frustration in the past, Classmates A has learned to channel that energy into studies and values being true to themselves. This authenticity is appreciated by their girlfriend.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Absolutely, your dedication and passion for learning have always been impressive. It's inspiring to see how you continue to delve into new topics with such enthusiasm.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant information pertaining to Classmates A's dedication to studying hard and taking extra classes to get into a good college, which ties into their enthusiasm for learning discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The MEMORY highlights how Classmate A's dedication has been noticed and supported by Classmate B in the past, suggesting a history of supportive interaction between the two. This helps in generating a response that acknowledges and encourages Classmates A's interest in learning about the pyramids. While the specifics about writing an essay on the Industrial Revolution are not directly related to the current conversation about the pyramids, the general theme of dedication to studies and personal growth is consistent and helpful. The sentence about the authenticity being appreciated by their girlfriend is somewhat extraneous to the immediate conversation, but it is well-phrased and connected to the theme of authenticity and diligence. Overall, the MEMORY is well-structured and gives useful background context which aids in understanding the development of conversations between the classmates."
