Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1.

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks! It's definitely a rewarding feeling to see a project come together.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information about Classmate A's support for the President, their entrepreneurial ambitions, and plans for a business seminar, as well as Classmate B's supportive nature. However, these details are not directly relevant or connected to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is focused on Classmate A's career as a carpenter and recent projects. While the memories provide some insight into Classmate A's personality and interests, they do not help generate a response related to the specific context of carpentry. Additionally, the memories are somewhat scattered and do not naturally lead to the dialogue about Classmate A's career as a carpenter, making it harder to identify important contextual cues related to the ongoing conversation."
