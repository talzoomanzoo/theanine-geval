Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: Hey, have you checked out my new blog? It's all about promoting under-the-radar artists.\nClassmates B: I haven't had a chance to yet, but that sounds really cool! What inspired you to start it?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B is supportive and willing to offer help in the future, as they want to see Classmates A happy and successful in life, who has been pursuing their passions and enjoying life.\n2. Classmates A and B are in the same class and have had previous conversations about study tips, with Classmates B reacting to Classmates A by sharing they have been working and traveling since high school.\n3. Classmates B gave advice to Classmates A in the past that paid off, leading to Classmates A finding success with it.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I've always been passionate about discovering new talent and giving them a platform to showcase their work. It's been a fulfilling journey so far.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful information about the relationship between Classmates A and B, such as B's supportive nature and their past interactions involving advice and study tips. However, it doesn't directly address the current topic of the blog about promoting under-the-radar artists, which is the specific subject of the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The information about past success with advice could be relevant for understanding the dynamic between A and B, possibly motivating B's supportive response, but it doesn't directly enhance the current conversation about the blog. Overall, the memory is somewhat helpful but not fully aligned with the dialogue context."
