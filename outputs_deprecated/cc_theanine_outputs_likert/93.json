    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I have some exciting plans for the future that I wanted to share with you.\nClassmates B: Oh really? What are they?\nClassmates A: Well, I was thinking that we could work on a project together and maybe even become business partners.\nClassmates B: Wow, that sounds amazing! What kind of project are you thinking about?\nClassmates A: I was thinking about starting a marketing agency specialized in social media.\nClassmates B: That's a great idea! I'd love to work with you on that. We could really make a difference in the industry.\n\nMEMORY:\nClassmates B admires Classmates A's outgoing nature and wants to be more like them, so Classmates B encourages Classmates A to work through their feelings and take steps towards a better future. \nClassmates A and B both enjoy socializing and going out to parties together, and they are open to meeting for coffee again in the future. They are looking forward to meeting up again after getting better sleep and Classmates B suggests going back to school or taking courses to improve. \nClassmates A encourages Classmates B to initiate conversations and be friendly to make new friends, which makes Classmates A social and enjoy meeting new people. As a result, Classmates A considers talking to a therapist or counselor to address past issues.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I'm glad you're on board! I think our combined skills and energy could really make this project a success. Let's start brainstorming some ideas soon.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nThe MEMORY provides some context about the relationship and interactions between Classmates A and B. It sheds light on Classmates B's admiration for Classmates A's outgoing nature and their mutual enjoyment of social activities, which aligns with the shared interest in collaborating on a marketing agency project in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, it suggests a supportive dynamic between them, with Classmates A encouraging Classmates B to make new friends and seek personal growth, which could potentially relate to working on a project together.\n\nHowever, the MEMORY does not explicitly mention past discussions or interests in business or marketing, which would be directly relevant to the dialogue's context. While it contains useful information indicating a positive rapport and ambition between the classmates, which is related to the dialogue, the details are somewhat generic and not specifically tied to the proposed project or business plans.\n\nOverall, MEMORY helps in understanding the charactersâ€™ relationship and personalities but lacks direct reference or detailed connection to the specific project or business discussions happening in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Thus, it is moderately helpful, earning a score of 3."
