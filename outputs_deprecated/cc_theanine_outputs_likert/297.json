Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I marked the boundary line with a pen on the wall so that we can both be clear about where my property ends and your property begins.\nNeighbors B: Oh, okay. I didn't realize there was any confusion about that.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A enjoys reading and sharing books with Neighbor B, which leads to Neighbor B admiring Neighbor A's career advancement and expressing interest in borrowing a personal development book. This prompts Neighbor A to offer help to Neighbor B in getting into a workout routine, but Neighbor B offers to be more supportive and check in on Neighbor A more often. \nNeighbor A and Neighbor B went to a concert together in the past, which leads to Neighbor A aspiring to be more important in the company and being promoted to manager after working harder and taking on more responsibility. This results in Neighbor A feeling like they are making a real impact at the company and being driven and motivated, but eventually feeling overwhelmed and stressed due to having a lot on their plate. \nNeighbor A enjoys reading and sharing books with Neighbor B, causing Neighbor A to believe in setting goals, developing a positive attitude, and taking action for personal development and career advancement. This leads to Neighbor A offering help to Neighbor B in getting into a workout routine, and Neighbor B suggests working out together to make it more enjoyable for both of them.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I just wanted to make sure we both have a clear understanding, especially with the new landscaping going on.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided offers some background information about the interactions and relationship dynamics between Neighbors A and B. It touches on shared activities like reading books and working out, and it provides insight into Neighbor A's career and personal development. However, this information seems tangential and does not directly relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which centers around a property boundary issue. The MEMORY lacks any mention or allusion to property, boundaries, or misunderstandings, which are key elements in the dialogue. While the memory is naturally phrased, it doesn't offer cues that directly inform or enhance the next response based on the given context, as it does not address the current topic of discussion or any past relevant interactions that could shed light on or resolve the present situation."
