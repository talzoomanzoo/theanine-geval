Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A:  I attended a really interesting talk today.\nClassmates B:  That sounds great. What was the talk about?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates B noticed Classmates A's improvement and acknowledged their hard work, which made Classmates B interested in attending a new technology conference next month.\n2. Classmates A's grades are looking good according to their teacher, so Classmates A is working on an essay about the Industrial Revolution and wants to consider how others perceive them, especially in situations like applying to college.\n3. Classmates A's grades are looking good according to their teacher, and Classmates A values being true to themselves and expressing their own style, which is the same topic as Classmate B being interested in attending a new technology conference next month.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It was about the future of renewable energy and sustainability. Very eye-opening!",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains details about Classmates A's academic performance and personal values, as well as Classmates B's interest in a new technology conference. However, these details lack direct relevance or connection to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, which is about a talk that Classmates A attended. The MEMORY does not provide information that would help generate a response to Classmates B's direct question about the talk's content in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Essentially, while the MEMORY provides some insight into the personalities and interests of the classmates, it is not structured in a way that supports generating a meaningful or contextual response to the current dialogue topic."
