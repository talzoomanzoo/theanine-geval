Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I'm the boss!\nCo-workers B: Yeah, we know. You don't have to remind us every five minutes.\nCo-workers A: I just want everything to go smoothly and according to plan.\nCo-workers B: I understand that, but it doesn't always have to be your way or the highway.\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A enjoys helping others and takes pride in their work, which Co-worker B appreciates by acknowledging Co-worker A's competence and effort in their work.\nCo-worker A is known for being competent and is trusted with important projects, and both Co-worker A and Co-worker B excel at working well with others and resolving issues, leading to Co-worker A giving Co-worker B a massage to help them relax.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some general information about the relationship between Co-worker A and Co-worker B, such as Co-worker A enjoying helping others, taking pride in their work, and being competent. Co-worker B appreciates Co-worker A's efforts, and both excel at resolving issues. However, there is a lack of specific information directly related to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT, where Co-worker A is asserting their leadership role, and Co-worker B is responding to it. While the MEMORY establishes a cooperative dynamic between the two co-workers, it does not directly address the tension seen in the dialogue about leadership and decision-making. The connection and development are present but not directly tailored to the context of the conversation. The information in the MEMORY is general and lacks specific cues that would help generate a response focused on the leadership aspect discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. This results in a moderate helpfulness rating."
