Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I've been really focusing on studying algebra lately.\nClassmates B: Why is that?\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A faced tough competition in middle school from a fast girl, motivating them to improve. Classmates B offers support and suggests taking a step back to find a balance. Classmates A expresses gratitude for the support and friendship of Classmates B. Classmate A and Classmate B are classmates. \n   \n2. Classmates A is always looking to challenge themselves and improve their skills. This attitude leads to Classmates A struggling with feeling competitive and the need to be the best at everything. As a result, Classmates A has not experienced similar pains in the past and is feeling worried about the situation. \n   \n3. Classmates B acknowledges Classmates A's determination and competitiveness. This leads to Classmates A struggling with feeling competitive and the need to be the best at everything. As a result, Classmates A has not experienced similar pains in the past and is feeling worried about the situation.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides a moderate level of helpfulness for generating a proper next response based on the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The DIALOGUE CONTEXT involves Classmates A focusing on studying algebra and Classmates B asking why. MEMORY 1 gives context about Classmates Aâ€™s competitive nature and appreciation for Classmates B's support, which can help contextualize Classmates A's motive for wanting to perform better. MEMORY 2 and MEMORY 3 both provide information on Classmates A's determination and struggle with competitiveness. They hint at an underlying theme of Classmates A wanting to be the best, which can be related to the desire to improve in algebra, although they repeat similar ideas. The sentences in MEMORY are generally relevant to the context, but they do not explicitly connect to algebra or academic improvement, which are cruxes of the current dialogue. Additionally, some repetition in MEMORY 2 and MEMORY 3 slightly detracts from its overall helpfulness, as the information could be more succinctly presented."
