Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I marked the boundary line with a pen on the wall so that we can both be clear about where my property ends and your property begins.\nNeighbors B: Oh, okay. I didn't realize there was any confusion about that.\nNeighbors A: Well, I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page. I don't want any misunderstandings in the future.\nNeighbors B: I understand. Is there anything else we should do to make sure we're clear about this?\nNeighbors A: I don't think so, but if you have any other suggestions, I'm open to hearing them.\nNeighbors B: No, I think the line is a good idea. It's clear and simple.\nNeighbors A: Great. Hey, speaking of lines and boundaries, remember when we talked about my promotion at work? I had to set some clear boundaries with my team about what I expected from them.\nNeighbors B: Yeah, I remember. How did that go?\nNeighbors A: It was tough at first, but eventually, everyone respected the boundaries I set and our team was more productive because of it.\nNeighbors B: That's great to hear. It's important to set boundaries and stick to them if you want to be successful in any area of your life.\nNeighbors A: Absolutely. And hey, on a related note, I wanted to talk to you about something else. Lately, I've been feeling really overwhelmed and stressed out.\nNeighbors B: I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help?\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors A's favorite book is \"The Great Gatsby.\" Neighbors B admires Neighbors A's career advancement and expresses interest in borrowing the personal development book. Neighbors A has been promoted to manager at their job and is taking on more responsibilities. Neighbors A is feeling overwhelmed and stressed, mentioning having a lot on their plate. \n\nNeighbor B enjoys listening to Neighbor A read and is interested in reading more. Neighbors B was read to from a book about personal development by Neighbors A, which had a positive impact on Neighbors A's career growth. Neighbors A feels like they are making a real impact at the company and is driven and motivated. Neighbors A is feeling overwhelmed and stressed, mentioning having a lot on their plate.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Thanks for the offer. Just having someone to talk to about it really helps.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides relevant and helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. It contains key details about the relationship and previous interactions between the neighbors, such as Neighbors A's career advancement and the stress they are experiencing, which aligns well with the topics discussed in the dialogue. The MEMORY also covers Neighbors B's admiration for Neighbors A's career success and their interest in personal development, which ties back to the conversation about setting boundaries at work and relates to Neighbors A feeling overwhelmed. This context is beneficial in allowing the dialogue to continue naturally based on previous interactions. However, there are some less relevant details, such as Neighbors A's favorite book, which do not directly contribute to the ongoing conversation. Nonetheless, the MEMORY is generally well-structured and relevant to the dialogue."
