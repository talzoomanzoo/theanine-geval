Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: Hi there, I was wondering if you'd like to join me for lunch on Tuesday at the school cafeteria.\nCo-workers B: Oh, sure. Thanks for the invitation. What time were you thinking?\nCo-workers A: Noon works for me. Is that okay with you?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for asking me to join you.\nCo-workers A: No problem, it'll be great to catch up. Hey, do you remember when we talked about me being irresponsible a few years ago?\nCo-workers B: Yeah, I remember that conversation. What about it?\n\nMEMORY:\nCo-worker A has made mistakes in the past but is trying to be more aware of their actions. This leads to Co-worker B moving on from their arrest and appreciating Co-worker A's concern and change in behavior, reminding Co-worker A of their progress and potential for success. \nCo-worker A feels remorseful about the situation that led to Co-worker B's arrest, and as a result, Co-worker B has moved on and appreciates Co-worker A's concern and change in behavior, being supportive and encouraging towards Co-worker A. \nCo-worker B has been arrested in the past partly because of Co-worker A's actions, which is in the same topic as Co-workers A and B working together on a big story in the past, causing Co-worker A to be a journalist and a finalist in a singing competition.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "speaker": "Co-workers A",
    "raw_prediction": "I just wanted to say that I've been really working on being more responsible since then.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some useful context for understanding Co-worker A's questions about irresponsibility and the reference to past events. It hints at Co-worker A's past mistakes and a connection to Co-worker B's arrest, indicating a history that could inform ongoing dynamics. This background may help the language model to grasp the significance of Co-worker A revisiting past irresponsibility. However, the MEMORY details aren't explicitly related to the current lunch invitation scenario. Additionally, the final sentence becomes confusing by mixing topics and introducing seemingly unrelated details about Co-worker B's past involvement in a big story and Co-worker A's achievements, reducing clarity and relevance to the present dialogue context. Despite this weakness, the MEMORY does offer some potentially helpful insights into the characters' past interactions and current emotional states. Thus, it merits a mid-range score."
