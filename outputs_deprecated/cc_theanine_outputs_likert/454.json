Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I wanted to talk to you about something.\nClassmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\nClassmates A: Well, it’s been on my mind for a while now and I couldn’t shake it off. I just can't stop thinking about you.\nClassmates B: Oh, really?\nClassmates A: Yes, really. I know we've been friends for a while now, but I feel like there may be something more between us.\nClassmates B: Hmm, I never thought about it that way. But I can’t deny that we have a great connection.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B, while working on a group project together, have developed a strong bond as supportive friends who always have each other's backs during stressful times. This has led to a close relationship with a high level of trust between them. Additionally, Classmate A values maintaining high standards and is reluctant to compromise on them.\n\n2. While collaborating on a group project, Classmates A and B's relationship took a turn when Classmate A uncovered a secret that Classmate B had been keeping. Reflecting on this discovery, Classmate A remembers a moment when they admired Classmate B's bravery and resilience in sharing this secret, showcasing their supportive and empathetic nature.\n\n3. After Classmate B reassured Classmate A about their commitment to the group project, Classmate A, known for overthinking, appreciated the support and guidance provided by Classmate B. Furthermore, Classmate B emphasizes the importance of self-compassion and finding a balance between striving for excellence and being kind to oneself.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "I understand if this is new territory for you. I just wanted to be honest about how I've been feeling.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 4\n\nThe MEMORY provides helpful information that complements the DIALOGUE CONTEXT and informs the generation of the next response. Here's why:\n\n1. The MEMORY outlines the supportive and trusting relationship developed between Classmates A and B through collaborative projects. This supports the dialogue context where Classmate A expresses feelings of a deeper connection, explaining how their friendship may have facilitated these romantic feelings.\n   \n2. Details about Classmate A uncovering a secret held by Classmate B, and Classmate A's admiration for Classmate B's bravery, further highlight their bond and indicates that they have shared meaningful experiences, enriching the context of the conversation.\n   \n3. The MEMORY also describes Classmate B as being a source of support and emphasizing self-compassion. This aligns with Classmate A's acknowledgment of their strong connection and can guide future interactions.\n\nOverall, the MEMORY highlights the emotional dynamics and history between the classmates, aiding a language model's response generation in the context of developing feelings. A more direct connection to the specific feelings expressed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT might have warranted a score of 5."
