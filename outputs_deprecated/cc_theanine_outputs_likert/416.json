Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: I'm really excited about finding a buyer for my product. I think it has a lot of potential.\nNeighbors B: That's great to hear, what kind of product is it?\nNeighbors A: It's a new type of workout equipment that's designed to be more efficient than traditional equipment. I've been working on it for months now and I really think it's going to take off.\nNeighbors B: Wow, that sounds interesting. Have you started looking for potential buyers?\nNeighbors A: Yes, I've been reaching out to various gyms and fitness centers to see if they'd be interested in carrying the product. I've even gotten some positive feedback from a few places.\nNeighbors B: That's awesome! I'm sure with your determination, you'll find the perfect buyer soon.\nNeighbors A: Thanks, I really appreciate your support. It's been a long road, but I'm confident that all my hard work will pay off.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbors B expresses a desire for Neighbors A to succeed and emphasizes the importance of treating others with respect and putting in effort at work. This supportive attitude strengthens their friendly relationship, as they enjoy having coffee and chatting together. Additionally, Neighbors A noticed that Neighbors B's dog has been missing for a few days.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some helpful context about the supportive relationship between Neighbors A and B, which aligns with their current conversation in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about Neighbors A's product and the encouragement from Neighbors B. This kind of positive interaction is consistent with the memory of Neighbors B supporting Neighbors A and reinforces Neighbors B's supportive nature. However, the detail about Neighbors B's dog being missing is not relevant to the immediate context of the conversation about the product and its potential buyers. While this part of MEMORY is structured in a way that is phrased naturally and connected to the overall friendship, it does not directly aid the development of the current topic in the dialogue."
