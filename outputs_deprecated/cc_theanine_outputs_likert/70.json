Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: , I need to talk to you about something important.\nClassmates B: Sure, what's on your mind?\nClassmates A: I know about your affair with that other woman.\nClassmates B: What are you talking about? I don't have an affair with anyone.\nClassmates A: Don't lie to me! I saw you together at the restaurant last week.\nClassmates B: That was just a business meeting. We were discussing a potential collaboration on a music project.\nClassmates A: I don't believe you. You're just trying to cover it up. I'm going to tell everyone and ruin your career.\nClassmates B: Why are you doing this? I thought we were friends.\nClassmates A: I can't stand that you're a better singer than I am. I'm envious of your talent and success.\nClassmates B: That's not a reason to try and destroy my life. If you're feeling insecure about your own abilities, that's something you need to work on. Don't take it out on other people.\nClassmates A: I know, I know. I'm sorry,. I was wrong to even think about doing something like that. Can you forgive me?\nClassmates B: Of course, but you need to promise me that you won't let your jealousy and spite get in the way of our friendship again. We're supposed to support each other, not tear each other down.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmates A and B have a good relationship, with Classmates A expressing admiration for Classmates B's intelligence and sense of humor. As a result, both Classmates A and B enjoy talking to each other and consider themselves great study partners. This positive dynamic is supported by mutual admiration and respect.\n\n2. Classmates A and B have a good relationship, with Classmates A expressing admiration for Classmates B's intelligence and sense of humor. They are both interested in biology and studying cells. Consequently, Classmate A is considering majoring in biology or the medical field, showing a shared passion for the subject.\n\n3. Classmates A has developed a crush on Classmates B, which Classmates B finds flattering. As a result, Classmates B is considering taking biology classes in college to learn more about how the body works.

    "speaker": "Classmates A",
    "raw_prediction": "I promise, I won't let my insecurities affect our friendship again. Thank you for understanding.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some relevant context about the relationship between Classmates A and B. It highlights that Classmates A admires Classmates B's intelligence and sense of humor, considers them great study partners, and shares a common interest in biology and the medical field. These aspects contribute to understanding the dynamics of their relationship, which could explain why Classmate A may feel envious and why the confrontation in the dialogue occurs. However, the MEMORY lacks direct references to any past conflicts or the rivalry mentioned in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. Additionally, the information about Classmate A's crush on Classmate B and their shared interest in science and healthcare is not directly relevant to resolving the current conflict in the dialogue. Thus, while the MEMORY provides some helpful background, it could be more specifically tailored to enhance understanding of the issues at play in the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT."
