Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Student, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nStudent: Whew! This hot sauce really makes my mouth burn.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The teacher's praise for the student's bravery in an emergency situation led to offering support and reassurance for the student to talk. This conversation transitioned into discussing retirement plans and the importance of family focus during retirement.\n   \n2. The student felt rewarded by the emergency experience and stressed the importance of quick action in emergencies. This led to appreciating the teacher's support and apologizing for the incident, showcasing their positive and understanding relationship.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provided does not offer information relevant to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The context revolves around the student commenting on the spiciness of hot sauce, while the memories focus on emergencies, retirement, and relationships, all unrelated to the topic at hand. There is no natural connection, causality, or development between the MEMORY content and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT about hot sauce. Due to this disconnect, MEMORY does not benefit generating a proper next response for the given dialogue context."
