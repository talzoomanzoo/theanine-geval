Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Neighbors B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nNeighbors A: Ugh, I need to finish this project before the deadline, but I just can't seem to focus.\n\nMEMORY:\nNeighbor A started construction on the house last week and plans to finish it in record time. Neighbor A believes they can make a lot of money without hurting anyone and plans to cover their tracks carefully.\nNeighbor A enjoys building houses and finishing them quickly, which led them to help Neighbor B build a new house with amazing features. As a result, Neighbor A was able to complete the project quickly and Neighbor B received a new house built by Neighbor A, leaving them grateful for the extra space. \nNeighbor B is looking forward to seeing the finished house and is excited about the new project. This excitement stems from the help and quick completion of the new home provided by Neighbor A, for which Neighbor B is grateful.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "Don't worry, you've got this! I'm sure you'll be able to finish the project in record time, just like you always do.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 3\n\nExplanation: \nThe MEMORY provides a hint of a potential context where Neighbors A and B have collaborated on a construction project, which could relate to the DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Neighbor A is struggling to focus on a project. However, despite this relation, the memory primarily focuses on construction and the completion of a house, which may not directly correlate with Neighbor A's current issue of not being able to focus. \n\nThe MEMORY does include helpful information about Neighbor A's work ethic and how past interactions have been between the two neighbors — especially Neighbor A's ability to complete projects quickly — which contextualizes Neighbor B's likely view of Neighbor A as efficient and reliable. However, much of the MEMORY is overly specific to past events and not directly connected to the current concern about focus and deadline pressure that Neighbor A is experiencing. \n\nOverall, the MEMORY contains some relevant and helpful details, but the connections could be more explicitly tied to the current challenge Neighbor A is facing. Thus, a score of 3 reflects that while there are some useful elements, the MEMORY doesn't fully enhance the understanding or direction for generating a response in the current context."
