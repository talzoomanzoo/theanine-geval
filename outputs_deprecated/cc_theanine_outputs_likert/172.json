    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY.\nYou task is to evaluate MEMORY based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Child, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nParent: Child, I have a new project that I've been working on.\nChild: What is it, Parent?\nParent: I created a website where I post advertisements, and people can pay to see them.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. The Child suggests creating a schedule for chores to ensure everyone contributes equally. As a result, the Parent expresses a desire to be a better role model for the Child and their siblings. This leads to open communication between the parent and child about various topics, including a past accident and the parent's willingness to contribute more to household chores.\n   \n2. The Parent is working and feels tired after a long day, causing them to emphasize the importance of being aware of surroundings and being careful while driving or walking. This is because the Parent mentions a terrible accident they witnessed on the way to the Child's school, which prompted them to see a doctor and start taking medicine for their illness.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "That sounds interesting, Parent! How did you come up with that idea?",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains two main entries, neither of which provide helpful information for generating a response in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT regarding the Parent's new project. The first memory entry about creating a schedule for chores and open communication is unrelated to the context about the website and advertisements. Similarly, the second memory entry about being tired and emphasizing safety after witnessing an accident is also irrelevant to the current conversation about the website project. The lack of direct relevance and connective development between the MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT limits its usefulness. The sentences are structured clearly, which helps in understanding the narratives, but they do not contribute to generating a coherent next response in this specific context."
