Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Co-workers A, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nCo-workers A: I have a plan to never let the bride get married to anyone else. I'm going to steal her and hide her away.\nCo-workers B: What?! That's not right, Co-workers A. You can't just take someone away like that.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Co-worker A witnessed a fight and intervened to separate the two women. Co-worker B is supportive and willing to help in any way. Co-worker A borrowed a pencil from Co-worker B without asking and felt guilty about it.\n2. Co-worker B commended Co-worker A for their bravery and willingness to help. Co-worker B reassured Co-worker A that it was not a big deal and even suggested making it up by buying coffee next time.\n3. Co-worker B mentioned helping a customer resolve an issue last week, showing a willingness to assist others. Co-worker A is alive but will need time to adjust to their new way of life.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 2\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY provides some context about the past interactions between Co-workers A and B, such as Co-worker A borrowing a pencil without asking and Co-worker B commending Co-worker A for bravery in a past situation. However, the memories do not directly relate to the current DIALOGUE CONTEXT where Co-worker A is making a questionable plan involving the bride. The past memories do not provide insight or relevant context that would help in generating an appropriate response to the situation being discussed in the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The memories are mostly unrelated and therefore not particularly helpful for understanding the current situation or guiding a response to it."
