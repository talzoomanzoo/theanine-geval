Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nHelpfulness (1-5): How much the MEMORY provides helpful information for a language model, representing Classmates B, to generate a proper next response based on DIALOGUE CONTEXT. An helpful memory should contain sentences that are naturally structured, representing the development (e.g., causality, connection, etc) of two speakers' past interactions. These sentences should be phrased in a way such that the language model can easily identify important contextual cues related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 means that most sentences in MEMORY do not benefit generating a next response OR are structured in a way that does not really tell us much about two speakers' past interactions (e.g., connection, relevancy, or development of events).\nA score of 5 means that MEMORY contains some sentences providing information relevant to DIALOGUE CONTEXT. And, sentences in it should be naturally connected so the development/causality/relevancy of sentences is clearly demonstrated. Even the sentences that are not related to DIALOGUE CONTEXT are naturally phrased such that the language model can easily identify them as not beneficial.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read DIALOGUE CONTEXT and MEMORY carefully.\n2. Rate MEMORY on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n\n[Your Task]\nDIALOGUE CONTEXT:\nClassmates A: I really enjoy being a carpenter. It's a very fulfilling job.\nClassmates B: That's great to hear! How did you get into carpentry?\nClassmates A: My dad was a carpenter, so I grew up around it. I started by helping him out when I was young, and then I began to really enjoy it myself.\nClassmates B: That's awesome that you were able to learn from your dad and turn it into a career. Have you done any big projects lately?\nClassmates A: Yeah, I just finished building a custom bookshelf for a client. It was a challenging project, but I'm really happy with how it turned out.\nClassmates B: That's impressive! You must have a lot of skill to be able to build something like that.\nClassmates A: Thanks! It definitely takes a lot of practice and attention to detail. But I find it really rewarding to see a finished product that I created with my own two hands.\n\nMEMORY:\n1. Classmate B hopes the President will consider their concerns and make improvements for the country's betterment. This aligns with Classmates A's appreciation for the support and encouragement from Classmates B.\n2. Classmate B hopes the President will consider their concerns and make improvements for the country's betterment. This leads to Classmates A being willing to work hard and learn the necessary strategies for business success, attending a seminar on starting a business, and planning to perform at an open mic night at a cafe next week.\n3. Classmate A supports the President and believes he is doing a good job, which resonates with Classmates A's appreciation for the support and encouragement from Classmates B, leading to Classmate A pursuing their passion for singing.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nHelpfulness Score:\n",

    "raw_prediction": "It must be incredibly satisfying to see your hard work come to life like that. Your dedication and craftsmanship really shine through in your projects.",
    "prediction": "Helpfulness Score: 1\n\nExplanation: The MEMORY contains information that seems unrelated and disconnected from the DIALOGUE CONTEXT. The DIALOGUE CONTEXT focuses on Classmates A's journey into carpentry and recent projects, while the MEMORY discusses thoughts and actions related to the President and unrelated activities like attending seminars and performing at events. There are no clear connections or developments between the past interactions mentioned in the MEMORY and the DIALOGUE CONTEXT, making it unhelpful for generating a relevant next response."
